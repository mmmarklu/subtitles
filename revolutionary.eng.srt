1
00:01:41,078 --> 00:01:46,042
- So, what do you do?
- I'm studying to be an actress. You?

2
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:50,004
- I'm a longshoreman.
- No, I mean, really.

3
00:01:50,129 --> 00:01:52,006
I mean really, too.

4
00:01:52,131 --> 00:01:53,174
Although, starting next Monday,

5
00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:54,925
I'm doing something
a little more glamorous.

6
00:01:55,092 --> 00:01:56,093
What's that?

7
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:59,430
Night cashier at a cafeteria.

8
00:01:59,597 --> 00:02:04,351
I don't mean how you make money.
I mean, what are you interested in?

9
00:02:05,603 --> 00:02:07,897
Honey, if I had the answer to that one,

10
00:02:08,064 --> 00:02:11,108
I bet I'd bore us both to death
in half an hour.

11
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:53,943
Thank God that's over.

12
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:58,114
So much for the debut
of the Laurel Players.

13
00:02:58,989 --> 00:03:01,450
And she was very disappointing.

14
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:13,003
- Frank! Very nice, Frank!
- Thanks so much, Mrs Givings.

15
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:16,674
I can't tell you how much we enjoyed it.
You have a very talented wife.

16
00:03:16,841 --> 00:03:18,968
I'll pass it along.

17
00:03:30,855 --> 00:03:33,691
- Frank!
- Hi!

18
00:03:34,358 --> 00:03:37,361
She's in there.
I'm about ready for that drink.

19
00:03:37,528 --> 00:03:39,321
Couple of minutes.

20
00:03:48,748 --> 00:03:51,167
April? Sweetheart?

21
00:03:54,211 --> 00:03:55,588
- Hi.
- Hi.

22
00:03:56,714 --> 00:03:58,424
- You about ready to leave?
- Yeah. Yeah.

23
00:03:58,549 --> 00:04:01,385
I've just got to get this makeup off.

24
00:04:08,309 --> 00:04:11,896
Well, I guess it wasn't a triumph
or anything, was it?

25
00:04:14,565 --> 00:04:20,363
- I guess not. I'll be ready in a minute.
- Take your time.

26
00:04:23,324 --> 00:04:25,284
Listen, will you do me a favour?

27
00:04:25,409 --> 00:04:28,287
Milly and Shep wanted us
to go out with them after.

28
00:04:28,412 --> 00:04:31,874
Will you say we can't? Say it's because
of the babysitter or something.

29
00:04:31,999 --> 00:04:33,918
Well, the thing is,
I already said that we could.

30
00:04:34,043 --> 00:04:36,003
I mean, I just saw them
and I said that we would.

31
00:04:36,128 --> 00:04:38,214
Then would you mind going out again
and saying you were mistaken?

32
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:39,423
That should be simple enough.

33
00:04:39,548 --> 00:04:41,300
Don't you think
that's a little bit rude, April?

34
00:04:41,425 --> 00:04:44,220
- Then I'll tell them myself.
- Okay. Okay. Take it easy.

35
00:04:44,345 --> 00:04:46,389
All right? I'll tell them.

36
00:05:28,013 --> 00:05:31,350
I mean it, baby.
You were the only person in that play.

37
00:05:31,475 --> 00:05:32,893
Thank you.

38
00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:38,441
We shouldn't have let you get
mixed up in the damned thing, is all.

39
00:05:38,566 --> 00:05:39,942
All right.

40
00:05:40,693 --> 00:05:44,321
What a bunch of amateurs. I mean,
you've studied, for Christ's sake.

41
00:05:44,447 --> 00:05:45,781
Could we stop talking about it now?

42
00:05:45,906 --> 00:05:46,907
Sure.

43
00:05:48,951 --> 00:05:51,412
I just don't want you
feeling bad about it, that's all.

44
00:05:51,537 --> 00:05:53,581
Because it's not worth it, you know.

45
00:05:53,706 --> 00:05:57,251
It's bad enough having to live out
here amongst these people...

46
00:05:57,376 --> 00:05:59,545
- What'd you say?
- I said yes. All right, Frank.

47
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:04,675
Could you just stop talking about it now
before you drive me crazy, please?

48
00:06:08,971 --> 00:06:10,639
What are you doing?

49
00:06:19,648 --> 00:06:22,943
April, sweetheart,
let's talk about this, okay?

50
00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:25,780
- No, Frank, please don't do that.
- Come on, now.

51
00:06:25,905 --> 00:06:27,782
- Don't touch me.
- April...

52
00:06:27,907 --> 00:06:30,409
Just leave me alone.

53
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:38,876
Okay. Okay.

54
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:44,048
It strikes me that there's a considerable
amount of bullshit going on here.

55
00:06:44,173 --> 00:06:47,259
And there's just a few things
that I'd like to clear up. All right?

56
00:06:47,385 --> 00:06:51,972
Number one, it's not my fault
that the play was lousy. Okay?

57
00:06:52,098 --> 00:06:54,308
Number two,
it sure as hell isn't my fault

58
00:06:54,433 --> 00:06:56,769
that you didn't turn out to be an actress,

59
00:06:56,894 --> 00:06:59,188
and the sooner you get over
that little piece of soap opera,

60
00:06:59,313 --> 00:07:00,481
the better off we're both going to be.

61
00:07:00,606 --> 00:07:03,317
Number three,
I don't happen to fit the role

62
00:07:03,442 --> 00:07:06,320
of dumb, insensitive suburban husband.

63
00:07:06,445 --> 00:07:09,448
You've been trying to lay that crap
on me ever since we moved out here.

64
00:07:09,573 --> 00:07:10,825
And I'm damned if I'll wear it.

65
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:15,871
Number four... April? April!

66
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,166
April.

67
00:07:19,709 --> 00:07:21,794
What the hell are you doing?
Get back in the car.

68
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,589
No. I will in a minute.
Just let me stand here for a second.

69
00:07:25,715 --> 00:07:27,299
God damn it!

70
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,473
April, can you please just get back
in the car and talk about this

71
00:07:34,598 --> 00:07:36,016
instead of running all over Route 12?

72
00:07:36,142 --> 00:07:38,728
Haven't I made it clear I don't
particularly want to talk about it?

73
00:07:38,853 --> 00:07:40,646
Okay. I mean, Jesus,
I'm trying to be nice

74
00:07:40,771 --> 00:07:42,690
about this thing here, for God's sake.

75
00:07:42,815 --> 00:07:45,860
How kind of you.
How terribly, terribly kind of you.

76
00:07:45,985 --> 00:07:47,445
Wait a minute. I don't deserve this.

77
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:49,155
You're always so wonderfully definite

78
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,948
on the subject of what you do
and don't deserve.

79
00:07:51,073 --> 00:07:55,578
Wait a minute! Wait a goddamn... April!
Now you listen to me.

80
00:07:55,703 --> 00:07:57,663
This is one time
you're not going to get away

81
00:07:57,788 --> 00:07:59,790
with twisting everything that I say, April.

82
00:07:59,915 --> 00:08:02,043
This just happens to be
one goddamn time

83
00:08:02,168 --> 00:08:03,836
I know I'm not in the wrong here.

84
00:08:03,961 --> 00:08:05,421
Christ, I wish
you'd stayed home tonight.

85
00:08:05,546 --> 00:08:06,797
You know what you are
when you're like this, April?

86
00:08:06,922 --> 00:08:08,299
You're sick. I really mean that.

87
00:08:08,424 --> 00:08:10,760
- You're sick! What?
- And do you know what you are?

88
00:08:10,885 --> 00:08:12,178
- You're disgusting.
- Oh, yeah?

89
00:08:12,303 --> 00:08:13,554
You don't fool me, Frank.

90
00:08:13,679 --> 00:08:15,723
Just because you've got me safely
in this little trap,

91
00:08:15,848 --> 00:08:18,309
you think you can bully me into feeling
whatever you want me to feel!

92
00:08:18,434 --> 00:08:20,936
- You in a trap? You in a trap?
- Yes! Yes! Me, Frank!

93
00:08:21,062 --> 00:08:23,939
- Jesus Christ, don't make me laugh!
- Me!

94
00:08:24,065 --> 00:08:27,526
You pathetic, self-deluded little boy.
Look at you!

95
00:08:27,651 --> 00:08:31,197
Look at you and tell me, how by any
stretch of the imagination

96
00:08:31,322 --> 00:08:33,449
you can call yourself a man?

97
00:08:36,202 --> 00:08:37,328
Damn it!

98
00:08:38,204 --> 00:08:39,705
Jesus Christ!

99
00:08:55,513 --> 00:09:00,476
- Don't look at me like that, April.
- Could we please go home now?

100
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,603
Fifteenth floor.

101
00:11:19,699 --> 00:11:24,036
I'm going to need your help
this morning, Old Scout.

102
00:11:24,161 --> 00:11:28,582
For the next few hours, you're to warn
me of Bandy's every approach

103
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:30,876
and you may need to shield me
from public view

104
00:11:31,001 --> 00:11:34,588
in the likely event I void my stomach.

105
00:11:34,714 --> 00:11:36,173
It's that bad.

106
00:11:36,298 --> 00:11:38,259
Good morning, Jack.

107
00:11:38,426 --> 00:11:40,678
Nothing good about it, I assure you.

108
00:12:02,742 --> 00:12:04,702
Of course, I knew the moment
you stepped off the train

109
00:12:04,827 --> 00:12:05,870
what you were looking for.

110
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:09,832
A small remodelled barn,
or a carriage house.

111
00:12:09,957 --> 00:12:11,792
And I just hate to be
the one to tell you that sort of thing

112
00:12:11,917 --> 00:12:14,420
just isn't available any more.

113
00:12:14,545 --> 00:12:17,048
But I don't want you to despair.

114
00:12:17,173 --> 00:12:20,718
There is one place up here
I want to show you.

115
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:24,889
Now, of course, it isn't very desirable
at this end.

116
00:12:25,014 --> 00:12:28,559
As you can see, Crawford Road
is mostly these little cinder-blocky,

117
00:12:28,684 --> 00:12:31,604
pick-up trucky places,
plumbers, carpenters,

118
00:12:31,771 --> 00:12:33,856
little local people of that sort.

119
00:12:33,981 --> 00:12:35,441
But eventually...

120
00:12:35,566 --> 00:12:39,904
Eventually it leads up to Revolutionary
Road, which is much nicer.

121
00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:42,239
Now, the place I want to show you

122
00:12:42,365 --> 00:12:45,826
is a sweet little house
and a sweet little setting.

123
00:12:45,993 --> 00:12:50,748
Simple, clean lines, good lawns,
marvellous for children.

124
00:12:50,873 --> 00:12:53,250
It's just around this next curve.

125
00:12:53,959 --> 00:13:00,341
Now, you'll see it. There.
See the little white one? Sweet, isn't it?

126
00:13:01,008 --> 00:13:06,305
The perky way it sits there on
its little slope? Charming, isn't it?

127
00:13:08,849 --> 00:13:10,017
Oh, yes.

128
00:13:21,153 --> 00:13:22,613
You wanted to see me?

129
00:13:22,738 --> 00:13:25,991
Came for you from Toledo this morning.
This is the third one this month.

130
00:13:26,117 --> 00:13:27,827
Sorry. I thought I'd taken care of...

131
00:13:27,952 --> 00:13:29,870
I'm not prepared to have this
conversation again, Frank.

132
00:13:30,037 --> 00:13:31,997
- You understand?
- I was literally just getting into...

133
00:13:32,164 --> 00:13:35,501
These folks in the provinces look up
to us. We need to be efficient.

134
00:13:35,626 --> 00:13:38,295
We can't have this
kind of back and forth, and so forth.

135
00:13:38,421 --> 00:13:43,175
- It's just not efficient. Am I right?
- Yes.

136
00:13:44,927 --> 00:13:47,513
- What was that about?
- Toledo.

137
00:13:48,055 --> 00:13:50,057
Branch manager wants
a revised brochure

138
00:13:50,224 --> 00:13:53,019
for the conference on the Knox 500.

139
00:13:53,144 --> 00:13:56,272
"It's just not efficient. Am I right?
Am I right? Am I right?"

140
00:13:57,064 --> 00:13:58,607
Sounds like a goodie.

141
00:13:58,733 --> 00:14:02,111
For God's sake. I don't even know what
the Knox 500 does. Do you?

142
00:14:02,236 --> 00:14:03,904
Don't insult me.

143
00:14:17,793 --> 00:14:23,382
If you'll look in the inactive file
under SP 1109,

144
00:14:23,507 --> 00:14:26,761
you'll find copies of all the stuff we sent
to the agency,

145
00:14:26,886 --> 00:14:32,224
that way we can trace the thing back
to its original sources.

146
00:14:35,728 --> 00:14:38,773
Listen, I hope you weren't planning
on having an early lunch.

147
00:14:38,939 --> 00:14:42,443
No. I'm not really hungry.

148
00:14:42,568 --> 00:14:44,862
Good. I'll check on you later then.
All right?

149
00:14:44,987 --> 00:14:46,405
- Okay.
- Okay.

150
00:14:53,871 --> 00:14:56,749
You know something, Maureen?
You're lucky you met me.

151
00:14:58,125 --> 00:14:59,585
How's that?

152
00:15:01,796 --> 00:15:04,090
I think I can show you the ropes,
you know.

153
00:15:04,256 --> 00:15:09,929
There's a certain art to survival at Knox.
Really. Let me show you what I mean.

154
00:15:10,638 --> 00:15:15,601
Waiter. Bring me the telephone,
would you? And two more martinis.

155
00:15:16,644 --> 00:15:17,645
Wow.

156
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:28,030
Klondike 5-55-66, please.

157
00:15:30,282 --> 00:15:33,285
Hello, Mrs Jorgensen?
Frank Wheeler here. Yes.

158
00:15:33,411 --> 00:15:36,455
I just wanted to let you know
that I've had to send Maureen Grube

159
00:15:36,622 --> 00:15:38,791
down to Visual Aids for me.

160
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:42,420
I'll probably need her
the rest of the afternoon. Yes.

161
00:15:43,587 --> 00:15:45,798
You, too. Take care now.

162
00:15:50,261 --> 00:15:57,101
- I never even heard of Visual Aids.
- That's because it doesn't exist.

163
00:16:18,372 --> 00:16:21,000
Hi, Helen. Come on in.

164
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:22,960
I can't stay a minute.

165
00:16:23,085 --> 00:16:25,921
I just wanted to bring
these sedum plantings

166
00:16:26,047 --> 00:16:29,091
for that messy patch
down by the foot of the drive.

167
00:16:29,216 --> 00:16:30,968
It's like the European houseleek,

168
00:16:31,093 --> 00:16:34,680
only these have the most marvellous
little yellow blossoms.

169
00:16:35,389 --> 00:16:36,891
Now, all it wants for the first few days

170
00:16:37,016 --> 00:16:40,644
is just a tiny dollop of water,
and then you'll find it absolutely thrives.

171
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:43,689
Well, thank you, Helen.
That's so kind of you.

172
00:16:44,565 --> 00:16:46,650
Would you like some coffee?

173
00:16:58,162 --> 00:17:00,664
Is there something
I can do for you, Helen?

174
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:03,125
I almost forgot.

175
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:06,837
There is one small favour
I would like to ask.

176
00:17:06,962 --> 00:17:13,886
It's about... It's about my son, John.
He's been in the hospital.

177
00:17:14,428 --> 00:17:16,347
I'm sorry. Is everything all right?

178
00:17:16,472 --> 00:17:22,395
Well, actually, just for the time being,
he's in Pleasant Brook. Psychiatric.

179
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:29,819
- Oh, I see.
- Well, it's nothing serious.

180
00:17:30,152 --> 00:17:35,491
He just got a little run down. Things can
just get the better of us sometimes.

181
00:17:35,616 --> 00:17:39,537
- Don't you agree?
- Yes. Of course.

182
00:17:40,204 --> 00:17:41,914
It's a marvellous facility

183
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:44,875
and the treatments
seem to be doing wonders for him.

184
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,586
Anyway, they said getting him out
for an afternoon

185
00:17:47,712 --> 00:17:50,172
might do him a little bit of good.

186
00:17:50,297 --> 00:17:54,218
I think he finds my friends
a little conventional, quite frankly.

187
00:17:54,343 --> 00:17:59,557
I mean, he's travelled.
He has a Ph.D. In mathematics.

188
00:18:00,099 --> 00:18:03,519
I suppose you could say
he's an intellectual.

189
00:18:05,146 --> 00:18:08,441
It would do him a world of good
to meet a young couple like you.

190
00:18:08,566 --> 00:18:10,651
Well, we'd love to meet him.

191
00:18:13,154 --> 00:18:15,614
- Really?
- Yes.

192
00:18:16,282 --> 00:18:17,783
We'd love to.

193
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,203
Thank you, dear.

194
00:18:23,748 --> 00:18:25,082
Thank you.

195
00:18:28,627 --> 00:18:30,629
Well, I must be off.

196
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,643
I remember the first day
you came off the train.

197
00:18:44,852 --> 00:18:48,230
You weren't like my other clients.
You were different.

198
00:18:49,398 --> 00:18:52,651
You just seemed special.

199
00:18:58,032 --> 00:18:59,408
Of course, you still are.

200
00:19:01,369 --> 00:19:04,789
Remember, just a dollop. I must scoot.
Toodle-oo.

201
00:19:11,045 --> 00:19:12,046
Bye.

202
00:19:29,271 --> 00:19:31,649
I think you got me a little drunk.

203
00:19:39,156 --> 00:19:41,492
You know what today is?

204
00:19:41,617 --> 00:19:42,827
Monday?

205
00:19:45,121 --> 00:19:50,042
It's my birthday. I'm 30 years old today.

206
00:19:51,085 --> 00:19:53,170
- Happy birthday!
- Thank you.

207
00:20:00,428 --> 00:20:04,682
What was the name of that department
you made up again?

208
00:20:10,771 --> 00:20:12,898
Visual Aids.

209
00:20:14,692 --> 00:20:16,068
What a joke.

210
00:20:19,697 --> 00:20:22,908
What a joke. Oh, my.

211
00:20:25,578 --> 00:20:28,664
- You want to hear a real joke?
- Yes.

212
00:20:31,542 --> 00:20:34,336
- My old man worked at Knox.
- Yeah?

213
00:20:35,921 --> 00:20:38,174
He was a salesman in Yonkers.

214
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:45,723
Once a year he used to take me
into the city for lunch.

215
00:20:45,848 --> 00:20:49,643
It was supposed to be a very special,
life-advice sort of occasion.

216
00:20:49,769 --> 00:20:52,730
- Nice.
- No. Not really.

217
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:57,193
I used to sit there and think,

218
00:20:59,612 --> 00:21:02,490
"I hope to Christ I don't end up like you."

219
00:21:06,202 --> 00:21:10,831
Now, here I am,
a 30-year-old Knox man.

220
00:21:13,376 --> 00:21:15,086
Can you beat that?

221
00:21:17,254 --> 00:21:19,423
I think I kind of lost you...

222
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,887
Your father worked for Knox?

223
00:21:25,012 --> 00:21:31,394
I'm sorry, everything's just kind of
going out of focus.

224
00:21:37,817 --> 00:21:42,446
Why don't we get some air,
you and me?

225
00:22:21,736 --> 00:22:23,154
Is this you?

226
00:22:25,364 --> 00:22:26,532
Yeah.

227
00:22:26,657 --> 00:22:30,494
- You been to Paris?
- I've never really been anywhere.

228
00:22:30,911 --> 00:22:33,664
Maybe I'll take you with me then.

229
00:22:33,789 --> 00:22:36,625
I'm going back the first chance I get,
I tell you.

230
00:22:36,751 --> 00:22:39,336
People are alive there. Not like here.

231
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:51,807
All I know, April, is I want to feel things.

232
00:22:53,601 --> 00:22:56,979
Really feel them, you know.

233
00:22:59,148 --> 00:23:01,192
How's that for an ambition?

234
00:23:03,027 --> 00:23:09,825
Frank Wheeler? I think you're the most
interesting person I've ever met.

235
00:23:17,208 --> 00:23:21,837
I guess this wasn't what you had in mind
when you went to work this morning?

236
00:23:22,088 --> 00:23:24,090
No. It certainly wasn't.

237
00:23:43,401 --> 00:23:45,653
Do you have a cigarette, Frank?

238
00:23:47,363 --> 00:23:48,698
Yeah, sure.

239
00:23:56,664 --> 00:23:58,124
There you go.

240
00:24:00,543 --> 00:24:02,920
Can I get you a drink or anything?

241
00:24:03,421 --> 00:24:05,798
No thanks, Maureen. Actually, it's...

242
00:24:05,923 --> 00:24:09,885
It's getting kind of late.
I guess I'd better be cutting out.

243
00:24:10,761 --> 00:24:16,100
Gee, that's right.
Did you miss your train?

244
00:24:16,225 --> 00:24:18,936
That's all right, I'll catch the next one.

245
00:24:20,312 --> 00:24:23,065
Listen, you were swell.

246
00:24:30,531 --> 00:24:32,074
Take care now.

247
00:25:06,317 --> 00:25:09,487
- Frank.
- Why are you all dressed up?

248
00:25:10,112 --> 00:25:13,991
First of all, I missed you all day
and I want to say I'm sorry.

249
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,745
I'm sorry for the way I've been
since the play.

250
00:25:18,162 --> 00:25:21,499
I'm sorry for everything, and I love you.

251
00:25:24,126 --> 00:25:25,628
The rest can wait.

252
00:25:25,753 --> 00:25:31,509
Now, you just wait here
till I call you. Okay?

253
00:25:32,051 --> 00:25:33,094
Okay.

254
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:45,398
All right, Frank. You can come in now.

255
00:25:59,745 --> 00:26:02,957
Happy birthday to you

256
00:26:03,082 --> 00:26:06,335
Happy birthday to you

257
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:10,798
Happy birthday, dear Daddy

258
00:26:10,923 --> 00:26:14,760
Happy birthday to you

259
00:26:17,179 --> 00:26:19,140
Happy birthday, darling.

260
00:26:19,432 --> 00:26:22,226
- I love you, Daddy.
- I love you, too.

261
00:26:38,951 --> 00:26:40,077
Frank.

262
00:26:47,251 --> 00:26:50,963
Frank. I have had
the most wonderful idea.

263
00:26:52,423 --> 00:26:55,968
- I've been thinking about it all day.
- Baby, what's all this about?

264
00:26:56,093 --> 00:26:58,095
Do you know how much money
we have saved?

265
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:01,390
Enough to live on for six months
without you earning another dime.

266
00:27:01,557 --> 00:27:04,643
And with the money we could get from
the house and the car, longer than that.

267
00:27:04,769 --> 00:27:06,604
"What we could get for the house"?

268
00:27:06,771 --> 00:27:10,149
Sweetheart, what are you talking about?
Where are we going to live?

269
00:27:11,525 --> 00:27:12,651
Paris.

270
00:27:13,819 --> 00:27:14,820
What?

271
00:27:14,945 --> 00:27:17,073
You always said it was the only place
you'd ever been

272
00:27:17,198 --> 00:27:20,826
that you wanted to go back to,
the only place that was worth living.

273
00:27:20,951 --> 00:27:22,495
So why don't we go there?

274
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:26,832
- You're serious?
- Yes. What's stopping us?

275
00:27:27,416 --> 00:27:30,878
What's stopping us? Well, I can think
of a number of different things.

276
00:27:31,003 --> 00:27:34,715
For example, what kind of a job
could I possibly get?

277
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:39,261
You won't be getting any
kind of a job, because I will.

278
00:27:39,595 --> 00:27:41,180
Oh, right, right.

279
00:27:41,305 --> 00:27:43,641
Don't laugh at me. Listen a minute.

280
00:27:43,849 --> 00:27:46,560
Do you know what they pay
for secretarial positions

281
00:27:46,686 --> 00:27:48,729
- in government agencies in Europe?
- No, I don't.

282
00:27:48,854 --> 00:27:51,899
Listen, Frank, I'm serious about this.
Do you think I'm kidding or something?

283
00:27:52,024 --> 00:27:54,485
Okay, okay.
I just have a couple of questions, is all.

284
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:57,321
For one thing, what exactly
am I supposed to be doing

285
00:27:57,446 --> 00:27:59,699
while you're out earning all this money?

286
00:27:59,824 --> 00:28:03,661
Don't you see? That's the whole idea.

287
00:28:03,994 --> 00:28:07,415
You'll be doing what you should've
been allowed to do seven years ago.

288
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:09,208
You'll have time.

289
00:28:09,458 --> 00:28:11,544
For the first time in your life
you'll have time to find out

290
00:28:11,669 --> 00:28:13,879
what it is that you actually want to do.

291
00:28:14,004 --> 00:28:15,339
And when you figure it out,

292
00:28:15,464 --> 00:28:18,884
you'll have the time and the freedom
to start doing it.

293
00:28:22,096 --> 00:28:25,349
Sweetheart, it's just
not very realistic, is all.

294
00:28:29,687 --> 00:28:33,649
No, Frank. This is what's unrealistic.

295
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:38,279
It's unrealistic for a man
with a fine mind to go on working

296
00:28:38,446 --> 00:28:41,073
year after year at a job he can't stand,

297
00:28:41,198 --> 00:28:42,950
coming home to a place he can't stand,

298
00:28:43,075 --> 00:28:47,079
to a wife who's equally unable to stand
the same things.

299
00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:50,499
Do you want to know the worst part?

300
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,962
Our whole existence here
is based on this great premise

301
00:28:55,087 --> 00:28:59,258
that we're special and superior
to the whole thing.

302
00:28:59,633 --> 00:29:01,177
But we're not.

303
00:29:01,802 --> 00:29:03,846
We're just like everyone else.

304
00:29:03,971 --> 00:29:07,850
Look at us. We've bought into
the same ridiculous delusion.

305
00:29:08,059 --> 00:29:10,144
This idea that
you have to resign from life

306
00:29:10,269 --> 00:29:13,147
and settle down the moment
you have children.

307
00:29:14,565 --> 00:29:17,109
And we've been
punishing each other for it.

308
00:29:17,234 --> 00:29:20,196
Listen, we decided to move out here.

309
00:29:20,363 --> 00:29:22,281
No one forced me
to take the job at Knox.

310
00:29:22,406 --> 00:29:25,117
I mean, whoever said I was meant
to be a big deal, anyway?

311
00:29:25,242 --> 00:29:29,372
When I first met you, there was nothing
in the world you couldn't do or be.

312
00:29:29,497 --> 00:29:31,290
When you first met me
I was a little wise guy

313
00:29:31,415 --> 00:29:32,416
with a big mouth, that's all.

314
00:29:32,541 --> 00:29:35,544
You were not.
How can you even say that?

315
00:29:37,838 --> 00:29:41,717
Okay. Okay, so I'll have time.

316
00:29:41,884 --> 00:29:45,388
And God knows that's appealing.
It's very appealing.

317
00:29:45,554 --> 00:29:47,807
And everything you're saying
makes sense

318
00:29:47,932 --> 00:29:50,976
if I had a definite talent,
if I were a writer or an artist.

319
00:29:51,102 --> 00:29:53,646
No. But, Frank, listen. Listen to me.

320
00:29:54,105 --> 00:29:56,565
It's what you are that's being stifled.

321
00:29:56,691 --> 00:30:01,070
It's what you are that's being denied
and denied in this kind of life.

322
00:30:03,572 --> 00:30:05,241
And what's that?

323
00:30:08,119 --> 00:30:09,662
Don't you know?

324
00:30:12,123 --> 00:30:15,876
You're the most beautiful
and wonderful thing in the world.

325
00:30:19,964 --> 00:30:21,507
You're a man.

326
00:30:40,401 --> 00:30:46,157
This is our chance, Frank.
This is our one chance.

327
00:30:52,038 --> 00:30:53,122
Okay.

328
00:30:57,084 --> 00:30:58,252
Okay?

329
00:31:00,671 --> 00:31:04,050
Why not? Why the hell not?

330
00:31:27,698 --> 00:31:30,326
- Good morning, all.
- Morning, Frank.

331
00:31:30,451 --> 00:31:32,620
Franklin. Good to see your shining face.

332
00:31:32,745 --> 00:31:37,625
- What's the news?
- Fellas, I'm moving to Paris.

333
00:31:39,752 --> 00:31:42,254
Indeed. And I'm moving to Tangiers.

334
00:32:00,272 --> 00:32:02,566
Intra-company letter to Toledo.

335
00:32:02,692 --> 00:32:07,363
Attention B.F. Chalmers,
Branch Manager.

336
00:32:08,989 --> 00:32:12,159
With regard to recent and repeated
correspondence,

337
00:32:12,284 --> 00:32:14,912
this is to advise
that the matter has been

338
00:32:15,037 --> 00:32:18,207
very satisfactorily taken in hand, period.

339
00:32:18,332 --> 00:32:23,546
Paragraph. We wholly agree that
the existing brochure is unsuitable.

340
00:32:24,463 --> 00:32:27,174
To this end, we have developed, quote,

341
00:32:33,055 --> 00:32:35,850
"Speaking of Production Control."

342
00:32:45,234 --> 00:32:49,905
Here you go, Mrs Wheeler. These are
the traveller's cheques you requested.

343
00:32:50,072 --> 00:32:52,491
- Yes.
- Your steamer reservations.

344
00:32:53,909 --> 00:32:56,537
These I'll pass on
to the embassy for you.

345
00:32:56,662 --> 00:32:58,456
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

346
00:33:03,044 --> 00:33:05,671
September. October at the outside.

347
00:33:07,631 --> 00:33:09,342
I just happen to think
people are better off

348
00:33:09,467 --> 00:33:11,927
doing some kind of work
they actually like.

349
00:33:12,053 --> 00:33:15,056
- Right. Right, yes.
- Absolutely, absolutely.

350
00:33:15,181 --> 00:33:20,603
But, I mean, assuming there is
this true vocation waiting for you,

351
00:33:20,978 --> 00:33:24,815
wouldn't you be just as likely
to discover it here as there?

352
00:33:26,734 --> 00:33:29,195
I don't think it's possible
to discover anything

353
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:32,615
on the 15th floor of the Knox building,

354
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:35,368
and I don't think any of you do either.

355
00:34:34,802 --> 00:34:36,554
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!

356
00:34:38,681 --> 00:34:40,975
- Michael.
- Daddy, will you read us...

357
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:46,605
...all the way to here.

358
00:34:47,273 --> 00:34:50,693
We have to take a big boat ride
across the sea to get there.

359
00:34:50,818 --> 00:34:55,197
- But I won't know anybody there.
- I know. I know. Neither will I.

360
00:34:56,073 --> 00:34:58,242
But remember how you felt
when you started school?

361
00:34:58,367 --> 00:35:00,995
And now look
how many friends you have.

362
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:04,707
You'll never guess
what they eat in Paris.

363
00:35:04,874 --> 00:35:07,084
- You'll never guess.
- What?

364
00:35:07,793 --> 00:35:10,254
- Slimy snails.
- Snails?

365
00:35:10,379 --> 00:35:13,382
Slimy snails and icky frog's legs.

366
00:35:25,936 --> 00:35:28,689
Milly, where are you, doll?

367
00:35:29,648 --> 00:35:32,568
You better get changed,
they'll be here soon.

368
00:35:33,611 --> 00:35:36,739
- Is that what you're wearing?
- Don't you like it?

369
00:35:37,365 --> 00:35:40,618
Yeah, yeah. You look great, doll.

370
00:35:42,161 --> 00:35:44,080
Guess I better haul ass.

371
00:36:00,805 --> 00:36:02,139
Hiya, gang.

372
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,146
What you watching?

373
00:36:48,728 --> 00:36:49,812
Shep?

374
00:36:52,189 --> 00:36:54,650
I was calling you and calling you.

375
00:36:57,695 --> 00:36:58,696
Hi.

376
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:08,456
Here we go. Just a little something.

377
00:37:10,041 --> 00:37:15,838
- Those look great. I'm starving.
- April, I can't get over it,

378
00:37:16,589 --> 00:37:19,508
you look like the cat that ate the canary.

379
00:37:19,717 --> 00:37:24,013
Do you have something to tell us?
Just a little bit of news?

380
00:37:24,221 --> 00:37:28,309
Well, actually, Milly, we... Well, we do
have some important news, yes.

381
00:37:28,476 --> 00:37:29,769
I knew it.

382
00:37:30,436 --> 00:37:33,230
Honey, why don't you tell them?
Go ahead.

383
00:37:35,274 --> 00:37:38,527
We're going to Europe. To Paris.

384
00:37:43,449 --> 00:37:44,658
To live.

385
00:37:48,496 --> 00:37:50,623
- What?
- When?

386
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:54,210
- In September.
- But what for?

387
00:37:55,795 --> 00:38:00,299
What for?
Well, because we've always wanted to.

388
00:38:00,466 --> 00:38:03,302
Because the kids are young enough.
Because it's beautiful.

389
00:38:03,427 --> 00:38:06,681
I mean, really.
Shep, you've been there, you tell her.

390
00:38:06,806 --> 00:38:09,058
- Yeah, it's a great city.
- Yeah.

391
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,776
When did you make this decision?

392
00:38:20,528 --> 00:38:23,030
About a week ago?
It's hard to remember.

393
00:38:23,155 --> 00:38:25,157
We just suddenly decided to go,
that's all.

394
00:38:25,282 --> 00:38:29,412
- About a week ago, you tell us now.
- We had to get used to the idea.

395
00:38:29,537 --> 00:38:32,498
So, what's the deal, Frank?
You get a job over there, or what?

396
00:38:32,623 --> 00:38:36,669
- No, no. Not exactly.
- What do you mean, "Not exactly"?

397
00:38:39,005 --> 00:38:42,758
Frank won't be getting
any kind of a job, because I will.

398
00:38:46,554 --> 00:38:48,305
So what are you going to do, Frank?

399
00:38:48,431 --> 00:38:51,642
I'm going to study.
And I'm going to read.

400
00:38:52,393 --> 00:38:56,647
I suppose I'm going to finally figure out
what I want to do with my life, Shep.

401
00:38:56,814 --> 00:38:58,649
While she supports you?

402
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:02,028
Yes. While she supports me.

403
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,947
In the beginning.

404
00:39:05,239 --> 00:39:07,992
You wouldn't believe what they pay
for secretarial work

405
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:09,994
in those government agencies
over there.

406
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:12,788
NATO and ECA and those places.

407
00:39:13,914 --> 00:39:15,583
And the cost of living
is dirt cheap, right?

408
00:39:15,708 --> 00:39:17,168
It's so cheap.

409
00:39:19,253 --> 00:39:22,048
The truth is we just need
something different.

410
00:39:22,214 --> 00:39:25,843
We're not getting any younger and
we don't want life to just pass us by.

411
00:39:25,968 --> 00:39:27,428
That's right.

412
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:31,182
Gee, it sounds wonderful, kids.

413
00:39:31,891 --> 00:39:35,311
I mean it. It really sounds wonderful.

414
00:39:35,436 --> 00:39:37,521
- Thank you, Milly.
- Oh, Milly.

415
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:41,192
We'll certainly miss you both.
Won't we, sweetie? Golly.

416
00:39:41,317 --> 00:39:42,985
- Sure.
- We'll miss you, too.

417
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:44,111
- Of course.
- True.

418
00:39:44,236 --> 00:39:46,280
We should have a toast or something.
To Paris.

419
00:39:46,405 --> 00:39:47,615
- To Paris.
- To Paris.

420
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:48,908
To Paris.

421
00:39:50,451 --> 00:39:52,078
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

422
00:40:05,549 --> 00:40:07,426
You know what I think?

423
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,303
What?

424
00:40:09,762 --> 00:40:12,932
I think this whole plan
sounds a little immature.

425
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:15,726
Oh, God, I am so relieved.

426
00:40:18,104 --> 00:40:20,731
Me, too.
I was thinking that the whole time.

427
00:40:20,898 --> 00:40:22,400
I mean, what kind of man
is going to sit around

428
00:40:22,525 --> 00:40:24,235
in his bathrobe all day picking his nose

429
00:40:24,402 --> 00:40:26,821
- while his wife goes out and works?
- I don't know, Shep.

430
00:40:26,946 --> 00:40:28,572
I just don't know.

431
00:40:35,246 --> 00:40:36,914
Why are you crying?

432
00:40:39,291 --> 00:40:40,960
What's the matter?

433
00:40:45,339 --> 00:40:48,801
It's nothing. I'm just so relieved.

434
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:51,971
Shep.

435
00:40:52,096 --> 00:40:58,436
Don't cry. Please. It's all right.
Everything's going to be all right.

436
00:41:00,896 --> 00:41:05,943
My God, their faces! Oh, God.

437
00:41:07,486 --> 00:41:08,612
Oh, God!

438
00:41:09,488 --> 00:41:12,324
You know what this is like,
April, honestly?

439
00:41:13,325 --> 00:41:14,410
Just talking like this?

440
00:41:14,535 --> 00:41:18,205
The whole idea of going off
to Europe this way?

441
00:41:18,414 --> 00:41:22,376
This is the way I felt going up to the line
the first time, in the war.

442
00:41:22,501 --> 00:41:25,296
I mean, I was probably
just as scared as everyone else,

443
00:41:25,463 --> 00:41:28,799
but inside I never felt better.

444
00:41:28,966 --> 00:41:32,887
I felt alive. I felt full of blood. I felt...

445
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:36,474
Everything just...
Everything seemed more real.

446
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:38,267
The guys in their uniforms.

447
00:41:38,392 --> 00:41:43,022
The snow on the fields, the trees.
And all of us just walking.

448
00:41:44,106 --> 00:41:46,817
I mean, I was scared, of course.

449
00:41:46,942 --> 00:41:51,864
But I just kept thinking,
"This is it, you know. This is the truth."

450
00:41:56,035 --> 00:41:57,995
I felt that way once, too.

451
00:41:59,455 --> 00:42:00,581
When?

452
00:42:08,881 --> 00:42:11,384
The first time you made love to me.

453
00:42:15,304 --> 00:42:16,430
April.

454
00:42:55,261 --> 00:42:56,387
Frank.

455
00:43:23,372 --> 00:43:25,833
- What's up?
- Bart Pollock's here.

456
00:43:26,125 --> 00:43:28,002
He's in Bandy's office.

457
00:43:30,046 --> 00:43:31,547
Big deal, huh?

458
00:43:36,969 --> 00:43:39,430
Looks like he wants to talk to you.

459
00:43:42,099 --> 00:43:44,935
Hey, keep my name out of it.

460
00:43:51,484 --> 00:43:55,196
Frank. Good to see you.
You know Bart Pollock?

461
00:43:55,321 --> 00:43:59,408
- Well, we've never met, but of course...
- Good to know you, Frank.

462
00:43:59,533 --> 00:44:02,119
"Speaking of Production Control"?

463
00:44:05,289 --> 00:44:10,127
Frank, this is a crackerjack.

464
00:44:12,004 --> 00:44:15,049
They are tickled to death in Toledo.

465
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:23,808
Really?

466
00:44:25,685 --> 00:44:29,980
So, this guy Pollock was perfect
presidential material in the worst sense.

467
00:44:30,147 --> 00:44:34,485
A million dollar smile and about three
pounds of muscle between the ears.

468
00:44:34,610 --> 00:44:36,696
April, you should have heard this guy.

469
00:44:36,821 --> 00:44:41,325
"Frank, this is a crackerjack."
What a horse's ass.

470
00:44:41,617 --> 00:44:45,162
Wish I'd seen his face
when you told him you were leaving.

471
00:44:46,205 --> 00:44:47,331
Yeah.

472
00:44:54,213 --> 00:44:55,673
Here they come.

473
00:44:58,884 --> 00:45:01,095
- Sorry to be late.
- You're not late.

474
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:03,806
- The traffic was terrible.
- Thank you. You didn't have to do that.

475
00:45:03,931 --> 00:45:06,183
- Good to see you.
- Wasn't it terrible, Howard?

476
00:45:06,308 --> 00:45:07,351
Well, Route 12.

477
00:45:07,476 --> 00:45:09,311
By the time they finish
that stretch of road,

478
00:45:09,437 --> 00:45:12,356
they'll have to start all over again, right?

479
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:16,861
- And you must be John?
- Say hello, John.

480
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:20,489
Nice to meet you. Heard a lot about you.

481
00:45:22,366 --> 00:45:25,202
- Where are your darling children?
- They're at a birthday party.

482
00:45:25,369 --> 00:45:27,538
- Sorry they couldn't be here.
- Don't worry.

483
00:45:27,705 --> 00:45:29,999
If I had a certified lunatic
coming around my house,

484
00:45:30,124 --> 00:45:32,585
I'd probably get the kids
out of the way, too.

485
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:37,006
Look at all this food. You didn't
have to go to any trouble for us.

486
00:45:37,131 --> 00:45:38,549
It's just some sandwiches.

487
00:45:38,716 --> 00:45:41,052
John, would you like a sandwich?

488
00:45:41,594 --> 00:45:44,972
Helen's been talking it up
about you people for months.

489
00:45:45,097 --> 00:45:47,808
The nice young Wheelers
on Revolutionary Road,

490
00:45:47,933 --> 00:45:51,520
the nice young Revolutionaries
on Wheeler Road.

491
00:45:52,646 --> 00:45:56,233
- Would anyone like some sherry?
- Please don't bother, Frank.

492
00:45:56,359 --> 00:45:57,568
I'd like some sherry.

493
00:45:57,693 --> 00:46:01,280
And I'll drink Helen's, too,
if she doesn't beat me to it.

494
00:46:02,823 --> 00:46:05,743
But, hey, you got a high-ball glass?

495
00:46:05,868 --> 00:46:09,872
Put a couple-three ice cubes in it,
pour it up to the brim.

496
00:46:10,414 --> 00:46:13,918
- That's the way I like it.
- I think I can handle that.

497
00:46:19,507 --> 00:46:23,344
This egg salad is delicious, April.
You must tell me how you fix it.

498
00:46:23,469 --> 00:46:26,472
- You a lawyer, Frank?
- No. No, I'm not.

499
00:46:26,597 --> 00:46:27,890
I could use a lawyer.

500
00:46:28,015 --> 00:46:30,685
John, let's not get started again
about the lawyer.

501
00:46:30,810 --> 00:46:31,811
Pop, couldn't you just sit there

502
00:46:31,936 --> 00:46:35,314
and eat your wonderful egg salad
and quit horning in?

503
00:46:36,190 --> 00:46:38,734
See, I've got a good
many questions to ask

504
00:46:38,859 --> 00:46:40,945
and I'm willing to pay for the answers.

505
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:44,281
Now, I don't need to be told that a man
who goes after his mother

506
00:46:44,407 --> 00:46:49,245
with a coffee table is putting himself in
a weak position legally, that's obvious.

507
00:46:49,370 --> 00:46:51,997
John, come and have a look
out this fabulous picture window.

508
00:46:52,123 --> 00:46:54,500
If he hits her with it and kills her,
that's a criminal case.

509
00:46:54,625 --> 00:46:57,795
- Oh, look, the sun's coming out!
- Lf all he does is break the coffee table

510
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,755
and give her
a certain amount of aggravation

511
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:02,842
and she decides to
go to court over it, that's a civil case.

512
00:47:02,967 --> 00:47:05,469
Maybe we'll have a rainbow.
John, come have a look.

513
00:47:05,594 --> 00:47:08,639
Ma, how about doing everybody
a favour? How about shutting up!

514
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:10,850
Settle down, now.

515
00:47:11,809 --> 00:47:15,688
Maybe I can look into it, recommend
someone. What do you say?

516
00:47:23,362 --> 00:47:26,407
So, what do you do, Frank?

517
00:47:27,616 --> 00:47:30,745
I work at Knox Business Machines,
actually.

518
00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:32,538
You design the machines?

519
00:47:32,663 --> 00:47:35,791
- Nope.
- Make them, sell them, repair them?

520
00:47:35,916 --> 00:47:38,836
- All these questions.
- I help sell them, I guess.

521
00:47:39,378 --> 00:47:43,841
I work in the office. Actually, it's...

522
00:47:43,966 --> 00:47:45,468
Well, it's sort of a stupid job, really.

523
00:47:45,593 --> 00:47:48,471
There's nothing interesting
about it at all.

524
00:47:49,722 --> 00:47:52,099
What do you do it for then?

525
00:47:52,224 --> 00:47:54,018
Maybe Frank doesn't like
being questioned.

526
00:47:54,143 --> 00:47:57,188
Okay, okay, okay.
I know it's none of my business.

527
00:47:57,313 --> 00:47:59,607
And besides, I know the answer.

528
00:48:00,483 --> 00:48:02,860
You want to play house,
you got to have a job.

529
00:48:02,985 --> 00:48:06,489
You want to play very nice house,
very sweet house,

530
00:48:06,614 --> 00:48:08,949
then you've got to have
a job you don't like.

531
00:48:09,075 --> 00:48:11,369
Anyone comes along and says,
"What do you do it for?"

532
00:48:11,494 --> 00:48:16,457
He's probably on a four-hour pass
from the state funny farm.

533
00:48:17,833 --> 00:48:21,379
- All agreed? Ma?
- Sorry, Frank.

534
00:48:21,504 --> 00:48:26,801
Don't be. Don't be. Actually, John,
I agree with everything you just said.

535
00:48:27,009 --> 00:48:31,597
We both do. That's why I'm quitting
the job in the fall. We're taking off.

536
00:48:31,722 --> 00:48:33,516
We're moving to Paris.

537
00:48:36,894 --> 00:48:39,313
Did you know about this, Ma?

538
00:48:41,065 --> 00:48:45,653
How do you feel about that, Ma?
The nice young Wheelers...

539
00:48:49,198 --> 00:48:54,328
The nice young Wheelers are taking off.

540
00:49:00,376 --> 00:49:03,796
- John, please.
- Steady down, Son.

541
00:49:08,843 --> 00:49:13,222
John. John. How about some fresh air?
What do you say?

542
00:49:13,347 --> 00:49:15,099
If that's all right with you?

543
00:49:15,224 --> 00:49:18,769
- I don't know if it's such a good idea...
- lf John wants to, I don't see the harm.

544
00:49:18,936 --> 00:49:21,272
- Good.
- After you.

545
00:49:25,568 --> 00:49:31,449
- I hear you're a mathematician.
- You hear wrong. It's all gone now.

546
00:49:32,366 --> 00:49:33,492
All gone?

547
00:49:33,617 --> 00:49:36,495
You know what
electrical shock treatments are?

548
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:38,289
Yes. Yes, I do.

549
00:49:38,414 --> 00:49:39,999
I've had 37.

550
00:49:43,753 --> 00:49:46,630
Supposed to jolt out
the emotional problems.

551
00:49:46,756 --> 00:49:51,177
- Just jolted out the mathematics.
- How awful.

552
00:49:52,011 --> 00:49:56,974
"How awful"? Why,
because mathematics is so interesting?

553
00:49:57,808 --> 00:50:00,728
No. Because the shocks
must be awful and,

554
00:50:01,103 --> 00:50:05,191
well, because it's awful not to be able
to do what it is that you want to do.

555
00:50:05,316 --> 00:50:07,818
I think mathematics must be dull.

556
00:50:09,403 --> 00:50:11,489
I like your girl, Frank.

557
00:50:11,697 --> 00:50:12,865
Me, too.

558
00:50:13,366 --> 00:50:16,535
So, what do a couple of people like you
have to run away from?

559
00:50:16,702 --> 00:50:19,080
- We're not running.
- So what's in Paris?

560
00:50:19,205 --> 00:50:22,249
- A different way of life.
- Maybe we are running.

561
00:50:23,042 --> 00:50:27,171
We're running from the hopeless
emptiness of the whole life here, right?

562
00:50:27,296 --> 00:50:29,173
The hopeless emptiness?

563
00:50:33,386 --> 00:50:37,723
Now you've said it. Plenty of people
are on to the emptiness,

564
00:50:39,809 --> 00:50:42,853
but it takes real guts
to see the hopelessness.

565
00:50:48,275 --> 00:50:49,276
Wow.

566
00:51:03,916 --> 00:51:06,502
You know, he's the first person

567
00:51:06,627 --> 00:51:09,505
who seemed to know
what we were talking about.

568
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:15,469
Yeah. That's true, isn't it?
Maybe we are just as crazy as he is.

569
00:51:17,513 --> 00:51:21,058
If being crazy means
living life as if it matters,

570
00:51:21,183 --> 00:51:24,145
then I don't care
if we are completely insane.

571
00:51:26,897 --> 00:51:28,065
Do you?

572
00:51:31,110 --> 00:51:32,111
No.

573
00:51:34,488 --> 00:51:36,240
I love you so much.

574
00:51:47,585 --> 00:51:50,880
Tell you something, Frank.
That Ted Bandy, nice guy.

575
00:51:51,130 --> 00:51:52,465
Real sport.

576
00:51:52,590 --> 00:51:54,258
Good enough department head and all.

577
00:51:54,383 --> 00:51:56,469
But I'm a little sore at him
for the way he's kept you

578
00:51:56,594 --> 00:51:58,596
under a bushel all these years.

579
00:51:58,721 --> 00:52:02,266
- This place okay for you?
- It's just fine, sir. Just fine.

580
00:52:03,142 --> 00:52:05,728
One thing interests me, Frank,
and one thing only.

581
00:52:05,853 --> 00:52:09,523
Selling the electronic computer
to the American businessman.

582
00:52:10,107 --> 00:52:12,985
That's why I'm assembling a team.
Men like you.

583
00:52:12,985 --> 00:52:14,236
That's why I'm assembling a team.
Men like you.

584
00:52:14,862 --> 00:52:16,614
Not your average salesmen.

585
00:52:16,739 --> 00:52:17,948
It'll mean more money,

586
00:52:18,074 --> 00:52:21,660
and, I got to be honest,
maybe more of a time commitment.

587
00:52:21,827 --> 00:52:25,247
But you'll be a part of
something exciting, Wheeler.

588
00:52:25,373 --> 00:52:26,624
Computers.

589
00:52:29,877 --> 00:52:33,047
Well, sir, it sounds exciting.

590
00:52:33,172 --> 00:52:34,924
- Bart.
- Bart.

591
00:52:40,012 --> 00:52:42,390
Bart, let me ask you a question.

592
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:46,769
Do you happen to remember
an Earl Wheeler? Out of Yonkers?

593
00:52:48,104 --> 00:52:52,400
- Can't say that I do. Relation of yours?
- My father.

594
00:52:52,525 --> 00:52:55,945
He worked as a salesman for Knox
for almost 20 years.

595
00:52:57,571 --> 00:52:59,281
Earl Wheeler.

596
00:53:00,449 --> 00:53:01,992
Earl Wheeler.

597
00:53:04,412 --> 00:53:06,997
There's no reason you'd remember him.

598
00:53:08,499 --> 00:53:10,876
Well, I'm sure he was a good man.

599
00:53:17,717 --> 00:53:23,055
Listen, Bart, there's something
I should have mentioned earlier.

600
00:53:25,182 --> 00:53:28,060
I'm going to be leaving the firm
in the fall.

601
00:53:29,895 --> 00:53:33,024
- Another outfit?
- No, no, it's not another outfit.

602
00:53:33,149 --> 00:53:35,943
Now, look, Frank.
Is it a question of money?

603
00:53:36,652 --> 00:53:38,070
Because if it is, there's no reason

604
00:53:38,195 --> 00:53:39,238
we can't get together on a satisfactory...

605
00:53:39,363 --> 00:53:42,533
Well, I sure appreciate that,
but no, it's not the money.

606
00:53:42,658 --> 00:53:47,663
It's... Well, it's more of a personal thing.

607
00:53:48,164 --> 00:53:49,999
I hope you understand.

608
00:53:50,333 --> 00:53:51,959
A personal thing?

609
00:53:52,918 --> 00:53:54,045
I see.

610
00:53:55,338 --> 00:53:58,591
Frank, let me tell you something
my father told me.

611
00:53:58,924 --> 00:54:01,886
A man only gets
a couple of chances in life.

612
00:54:02,219 --> 00:54:04,263
If he doesn't grab them by the balls,

613
00:54:04,388 --> 00:54:06,140
it won't be long before
he's sitting around wondering

614
00:54:06,265 --> 00:54:08,559
how he got to be second rate.

615
00:54:14,565 --> 00:54:16,025
I guess so.

616
00:54:17,109 --> 00:54:19,820
So, do me a favour. Sleep on it.

617
00:54:21,655 --> 00:54:23,657
Discuss it with your wife.

618
00:54:24,992 --> 00:54:26,619
Because let's be honest,
where the hell would any of us be

619
00:54:26,744 --> 00:54:28,746
without our wives, anyway?

620
00:54:32,208 --> 00:54:35,920
And, Frank, in all sincerity,
if you do decide to join us,

621
00:54:36,045 --> 00:54:39,173
I believe it'll be a thing
you'll never regret.

622
00:54:40,257 --> 00:54:42,802
And I believe something else, too.

623
00:54:43,177 --> 00:54:46,263
I believe it'd be a fine memorial
to your dad.

624
00:54:48,766 --> 00:54:51,769
Think about it, Frank.
Really think about it.

625
00:54:58,693 --> 00:55:01,070
Knowing what you've got, comma,

626
00:55:03,155 --> 00:55:05,866
knowing what you need, comma,

627
00:55:07,618 --> 00:55:11,455
knowing what you can do without, dash.

628
00:55:13,374 --> 00:55:15,418
That's inventory control.

629
00:55:33,561 --> 00:55:36,022
Knowing what you've got, comma,

630
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:40,484
knowing what you need, comma,

631
00:55:42,486 --> 00:55:46,198
knowing what you can do without, dash.

632
00:55:48,159 --> 00:55:50,077
That's inventory control.

633
00:55:52,038 --> 00:55:53,372
Hi, Frank.

634
00:55:55,333 --> 00:55:56,751
Working late?

635
00:55:57,585 --> 00:56:01,088
Yeah. I got to dig myself out here.

636
00:56:03,341 --> 00:56:05,843
I heard you were getting promoted.

637
00:56:07,219 --> 00:56:08,512
Big shot.

638
00:56:12,224 --> 00:56:15,353
I guess your dad would have been
real proud, huh?

639
00:56:23,444 --> 00:56:25,321
Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.

640
00:56:34,872 --> 00:56:38,209
So maybe I should take you
for a drink or something?

641
00:56:39,543 --> 00:56:42,254
You know, celebrate.

642
00:56:46,967 --> 00:56:48,386
Yeah, maybe.

643
00:56:52,973 --> 00:56:54,934
I'll just get my things.

644
00:57:02,692 --> 00:57:04,568
I'm going to bring my doll carriage

645
00:57:04,694 --> 00:57:07,571
and my three Easter rabbits
and my giraffe

646
00:57:07,697 --> 00:57:10,700
and all my dolls and my doll house
and my crayons...

647
00:57:10,825 --> 00:57:12,535
I thought maybe
we'd give the doll house to Madeline.

648
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:14,662
I don't want to give the doll house
to Madeline.

649
00:57:14,787 --> 00:57:15,996
But I already explained to you,

650
00:57:16,122 --> 00:57:17,665
the big things
are going to be hard to pack.

651
00:57:17,790 --> 00:57:19,166
But she can have my bear,

652
00:57:19,291 --> 00:57:22,712
- and my three Easter rabbits.
- No! Just the big things.

653
00:57:22,837 --> 00:57:24,880
Look. Wouldn't you rather go outside
and play with Michael?

654
00:57:25,006 --> 00:57:27,508
- I don't feel like it.
- You've been inside all day.

655
00:57:27,633 --> 00:57:28,801
I don't feel like it.

656
00:57:28,926 --> 00:57:32,013
Well, I don't feel like
explaining everything 15 times

657
00:57:32,138 --> 00:57:35,224
to somebody who's too bored and silly
to listen!

658
00:57:42,106 --> 00:57:44,859
- All right, April. What's the matter?
- Nothing.

659
00:57:44,984 --> 00:57:47,653
I don't believe you.
Did something happen this morning?

660
00:57:47,778 --> 00:57:51,198
Nothing happened today that I haven't
known about for days and days.

661
00:57:51,323 --> 00:57:52,366
What?

662
00:57:53,075 --> 00:57:55,911
Oh, God, Frank,
please don't look so dense.

663
00:57:56,078 --> 00:57:57,747
You mean you haven't guessed
or anything?

664
00:57:57,872 --> 00:58:00,249
April, what are you talking about?

665
00:58:03,461 --> 00:58:05,504
I'm pregnant, that's all.

666
00:58:08,341 --> 00:58:09,383
What?

667
00:58:09,508 --> 00:58:11,761
Frank, I meant to wait
till the kids were in bed to tell you,

668
00:58:11,886 --> 00:58:14,805
but I just...
Well, I've been pretty sure all week

669
00:58:14,930 --> 00:58:16,223
and today I went to the doctor,

670
00:58:16,349 --> 00:58:19,101
and now I can't even pretend
it's not true.

671
00:58:20,603 --> 00:58:22,605
- How long?
- Ten weeks.

672
00:58:25,066 --> 00:58:29,487
Ten weeks. Ten weeks?
And you wait until now to tell me?

673
00:58:29,612 --> 00:58:35,409
I thought... I don't know what I thought.
I'm sorry, Frank. I'm so sorry.

674
00:58:35,659 --> 00:58:38,287
I know. I know you are. All right?

675
00:58:39,455 --> 00:58:41,582
There are things we can do.

676
00:58:41,707 --> 00:58:44,669
We don't have to let this stop us
from going, do we?

677
00:58:44,794 --> 00:58:47,004
Remember that girl at school
I told you about?

678
00:58:47,129 --> 00:58:50,716
As long as we take care of it
before 12 weeks, it's fine.

679
00:58:51,926 --> 00:58:54,637
We've got to be together in this, Frank.

680
00:58:56,972 --> 00:59:01,644
Well, we'll figure it out. All right?

681
00:59:04,146 --> 00:59:05,439
Come here.

682
00:59:08,317 --> 00:59:11,737
Twelve weeks.
So we have time to decide, right?

683
00:59:12,238 --> 00:59:13,406
Right.

684
00:59:15,783 --> 00:59:17,159
I love you.

685
00:59:19,620 --> 00:59:21,247
I love you, too.

686
01:00:07,251 --> 01:00:11,255
So, Frank, how's work?
They gonna survive without you?

687
01:00:13,466 --> 01:00:16,552
Actually, something kind of funny
happened the other day.

688
01:00:17,762 --> 01:00:21,223
I did some dumb little piece of work
to get myself off the hook with Bandy,

689
01:00:21,349 --> 01:00:24,143
and suddenly,
I'm the bright young man.

690
01:00:25,353 --> 01:00:27,897
- That's always the way, ain't it?
- It's incredible.

691
01:00:28,022 --> 01:00:29,982
I mean, I knocked this thing off
in a couple of minutes

692
01:00:30,107 --> 01:00:33,986
and now they want me to join
their team of "specialist" salesmen.

693
01:00:34,403 --> 01:00:35,654
Morons.

694
01:00:37,782 --> 01:00:39,658
Well, it would be funny
if they weren't offering

695
01:00:39,784 --> 01:00:41,494
so much damn money.

696
01:00:46,165 --> 01:00:47,917
So, are you tempted?

697
01:00:48,584 --> 01:00:51,671
Well, it's just kind of ironic,
don't you think?

698
01:01:15,444 --> 01:01:17,863
I thought you turned the job down.

699
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:20,408
Not yet.

700
01:01:21,617 --> 01:01:23,911
It's just an option, that's all.

701
01:01:24,996 --> 01:01:28,040
With the kind of money they're talking,
things could be different for us here.

702
01:01:28,165 --> 01:01:30,751
We could get a better place. Travel.

703
01:01:31,711 --> 01:01:35,006
The point is, we could be happy here,
at least for a little while.

704
01:01:35,131 --> 01:01:37,299
It is possible that Parisians
aren't the only ones

705
01:01:37,425 --> 01:01:40,302
capable of leading
interesting lives, April.

706
01:01:40,428 --> 01:01:42,388
So you've made up your mind?

707
01:01:42,513 --> 01:01:46,475
No. No. Like I said, it's just an option.
That's all.

708
01:01:50,354 --> 01:01:52,481
And supposing you're right.

709
01:01:52,732 --> 01:01:56,652
You make all this money
and we have this interesting life here.

710
01:01:57,153 --> 01:02:01,907
Won't you still be wasting your life
toiling away at a job you find ridiculous?

711
01:02:02,867 --> 01:02:05,077
Maybe we let that be my business,
all right?

712
01:02:05,202 --> 01:02:06,579
Your business?

713
01:02:06,704 --> 01:02:10,541
You know what? It's too hot for this.
I'm going to go get wet.

714
01:02:22,636 --> 01:02:26,015
- You don't want to go, do you?
- Come on, April. Of course, I do.

715
01:02:26,140 --> 01:02:29,060
No, you don't.
Because you've never tried at anything.

716
01:02:29,185 --> 01:02:31,979
And if you don't try at anything,
you can't fail.

717
01:02:32,104 --> 01:02:34,357
What the hell do you mean I don't try?

718
01:02:34,482 --> 01:02:36,942
I support you, don't I?
I pay for this house.

719
01:02:37,068 --> 01:02:38,611
I work 10 hours a day
at a job I can't stand.

720
01:02:38,611 --> 01:02:39,528
I work 10 hours a day
at a job I can't stand.

721
01:02:39,653 --> 01:02:41,864
- You don't have to.
- Bullshit!

722
01:02:42,156 --> 01:02:43,324
Look, I'm not happy about it.

723
01:02:43,449 --> 01:02:46,369
But I have the backbone not to run away
from my responsibilities.

724
01:02:46,494 --> 01:02:49,705
It takes backbone
to lead the life you want, Frank.

725
01:02:54,335 --> 01:02:55,378
Where are you going?

726
01:02:55,503 --> 01:02:59,799
If it's all right with you, April,
I'm gonna go use the bathroom. Okay?

727
01:03:28,035 --> 01:03:30,913
What the hell are you going to do
with this?

728
01:03:31,038 --> 01:03:32,498
And what do you think
you're going to do?

729
01:03:32,623 --> 01:03:34,250
- You're going to stop me?
- You're damn right I am!

730
01:03:34,375 --> 01:03:35,501
Go ahead and try.

731
01:03:35,626 --> 01:03:39,296
Listen to me. You do this, April,
you do this and I swear to God I'II...

732
01:03:39,422 --> 01:03:41,716
You'll what? You'll leave me?
Is that a threat or a promise?

733
01:03:41,841 --> 01:03:42,925
When did you buy this, April?

734
01:03:43,050 --> 01:03:44,510
How long have you had this?
I want to know!

735
01:03:44,635 --> 01:03:45,678
Jesus Christ.

736
01:03:45,803 --> 01:03:48,723
You really are being melodramatic
about this whole thing.

737
01:03:48,848 --> 01:03:52,435
As long as it's done
in the first 12 weeks, it's perfectly safe.

738
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:55,646
- That's now, April! Don't I get a say?
- Of course you do!

739
01:03:55,771 --> 01:03:57,982
It would be for you, Frank.
Don't you see?

740
01:03:58,107 --> 01:04:00,067
So you can have time,
just like we talked about.

741
01:04:00,192 --> 01:04:01,527
How can it be for me
when the thought of it

742
01:04:01,652 --> 01:04:03,571
makes my stomach turn over,
for God's sake?

743
01:04:03,696 --> 01:04:05,072
Then it's for me.

744
01:04:05,197 --> 01:04:07,033
Tell me we can have the baby
in Paris, Frank.

745
01:04:07,158 --> 01:04:11,370
Tell me we can have a different life.
But don't make me stay here. Please.

746
01:04:11,495 --> 01:04:14,707
- We can't have the baby in Paris.
- Why not?

747
01:04:14,832 --> 01:04:17,835
I don't need everything we have here.
I don't care where we live.

748
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:20,546
I mean, who made these rules, anyway?

749
01:04:21,589 --> 01:04:26,594
Look, the only reason we moved
out here was because I got pregnant.

750
01:04:26,719 --> 01:04:29,221
Then we had another child to prove
the first one wasn't a mistake.

751
01:04:29,347 --> 01:04:31,640
I mean, how long does it go on?

752
01:04:32,975 --> 01:04:36,562
Frank.
Do you actually want another child?

753
01:04:38,564 --> 01:04:42,026
Well, do you? Come on, tell me.

754
01:04:43,027 --> 01:04:45,946
Tell me the truth, Frank.
Remember that?

755
01:04:46,655 --> 01:04:48,407
We used to live by it.

756
01:04:48,532 --> 01:04:50,868
And you know what's so good
about the truth?

757
01:04:50,993 --> 01:04:54,914
Everyone knows what it is,
however long they've lived without it.

758
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:59,085
No one forgets the truth, Frank.
They just get better at lying.

759
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:05,841
So tell me,
do you really want another child?

760
01:05:07,718 --> 01:05:09,845
All I know is what I feel.

761
01:05:12,390 --> 01:05:16,686
And anyone else in their right mind
would feel the same way, April.

762
01:05:16,811 --> 01:05:21,023
But I've had two children.
Doesn't that count in my favour?

763
01:05:21,232 --> 01:05:24,110
Christ, April!
The fact that you even put it that way!

764
01:05:24,235 --> 01:05:28,197
You make it seem as if having children
is some sort of a goddamn punishment.

765
01:05:28,322 --> 01:05:30,366
I love my children, Frank.

766
01:05:32,410 --> 01:05:34,704
And you're sure about that, huh?

767
01:05:35,246 --> 01:05:37,373
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

768
01:05:37,498 --> 01:05:41,127
April, you just said our daughter
was a mistake.

769
01:05:41,669 --> 01:05:43,546
How do I know you didn't try
to get rid of her,

770
01:05:43,671 --> 01:05:45,256
- or Michael for that matter?
- No.

771
01:05:45,423 --> 01:05:48,217
How do I know you didn't try to flush
our entire fucking family

772
01:05:48,342 --> 01:05:51,345
- down the toilet?
- No, that's not true. Of course I didn't.

773
01:05:51,470 --> 01:05:53,389
But how do I know, April?

774
01:05:53,597 --> 01:05:56,600
Stop. Please just stop, Frank.

775
01:05:57,143 --> 01:06:01,522
April, a normal woman,
a normal sane mother

776
01:06:01,647 --> 01:06:04,900
doesn't buy a piece of rubber tubing
to give herself an abortion

777
01:06:05,026 --> 01:06:08,279
so she can live out
some kind of a goddamn fantasy.

778
01:06:18,873 --> 01:06:23,961
Look, all I'm saying is you don't seem
entirely rational about this thing.

779
01:06:25,671 --> 01:06:27,631
And I think it's about time
we found somebody

780
01:06:27,757 --> 01:06:30,051
to help make some sense of your life.

781
01:06:31,302 --> 01:06:34,263
And the new job's going to
pay for that, too?

782
01:06:36,557 --> 01:06:41,270
April, if you need a shrink,
it will be paid for.

783
01:06:42,396 --> 01:06:43,773
Obviously.

784
01:06:47,985 --> 01:06:52,281
Okay. I guess there isn't much more
to say then, is there?

785
01:07:01,832 --> 01:07:04,960
So I guess Paris
was a pretty childish idea, huh?

786
01:07:11,008 --> 01:07:12,802
I guess maybe it was.

787
01:07:26,148 --> 01:07:30,152
April, we can be happy here.

788
01:07:31,529 --> 01:07:33,489
I can make you happy here.

789
01:07:34,281 --> 01:07:37,994
We've had a great couple of months.
It doesn't need to end.

790
01:07:40,621 --> 01:07:44,667
We're going to be okay. I promise.

791
01:07:48,921 --> 01:07:50,548
I hope so, Frank.

792
01:07:52,383 --> 01:07:54,010
I really hope so.

793
01:08:34,759 --> 01:08:37,928
Thank you for waiting.
Mr Pollock will see you now.

794
01:08:39,930 --> 01:08:41,515
Thanks so much.

795
01:08:52,276 --> 01:08:54,612
Foiled by faulty contraception.

796
01:08:56,530 --> 01:08:58,032
I can't say that I'm sorry.

797
01:08:58,157 --> 01:09:01,827
You'd have been sorely missed
in the old cubicle, I can tell you that.

798
01:09:01,952 --> 01:09:04,664
Wouldn't have been the same
without you.

799
01:09:04,789 --> 01:09:07,833
Besides... Well...

800
01:09:10,586 --> 01:09:11,587
What?

801
01:09:12,963 --> 01:09:18,010
The plan always seemed
a touch unrealistic, don't you think?

802
01:09:22,807 --> 01:09:24,100
I suppose
it's none of my business, really.

803
01:09:24,225 --> 01:09:27,520
No. No. I suppose it isn't.

804
01:09:31,232 --> 01:09:32,358
Well...

805
01:09:35,361 --> 01:09:38,781
They'll be celebrating
in the secretarial pool.

806
01:10:08,060 --> 01:10:11,022
Hey! Remember the first time
you brought us here?

807
01:10:11,147 --> 01:10:12,273
Absolutely.

808
01:10:12,398 --> 01:10:16,485
You said it takes a special kind of taste
to enjoy Vito's Log Cabin.

809
01:10:16,694 --> 01:10:19,363
It's so awful, it's kind of nice.

810
01:10:23,034 --> 01:10:29,081
Look at me. I'm just so happy.
Our little gang's back together again.

811
01:10:42,219 --> 01:10:45,556
- Hey, Europe's not going anywhere.
- That's right.

812
01:11:08,412 --> 01:11:11,082
April, honey, how about a dance?

813
01:11:13,584 --> 01:11:16,128
Not right now. Maybe later.

814
01:11:16,253 --> 01:11:18,798
- I'll dance.
- Okay.

815
01:11:33,688 --> 01:11:36,774
Guess she's still pretty blue
about Paris, huh?

816
01:11:37,525 --> 01:11:38,734
Think she'll be okay?

817
01:11:38,859 --> 01:11:42,613
Sure. Give us girls a couple of days
and we can get over anything.

818
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:43,906
Right.

819
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:46,867
Frank.

820
01:11:49,954 --> 01:11:51,163
Frank.

821
01:11:53,457 --> 01:11:54,583
Frank.

822
01:11:54,959 --> 01:11:56,585
Frank.

823
01:11:56,711 --> 01:11:59,505
Are you okay? Are you okay? Milly?

824
01:12:00,297 --> 01:12:01,674
I'm so sorry.

825
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:04,135
Excuse me.

826
01:12:09,140 --> 01:12:10,766
That's just great.

827
01:12:11,517 --> 01:12:14,437
How the hell
are we supposed to get out now?

828
01:12:14,854 --> 01:12:16,105
Oh, boy.

829
01:12:17,690 --> 01:12:20,484
Don't worry about it, Shep.
We can wait. Really.

830
01:12:20,693 --> 01:12:22,194
What about the sitter?

831
01:12:22,319 --> 01:12:25,322
Listen, why don't you drive Milly home,
then go home yourself.

832
01:12:25,489 --> 01:12:28,367
That takes care of both sitters.
Then Shep can take me home later.

833
01:12:28,492 --> 01:12:31,120
- Yeah, it's fine by me.
- Okay, then.

834
01:12:32,496 --> 01:12:36,042
- You... You'll be all right?
- Sure.

835
01:12:36,876 --> 01:12:37,960
Okay.

836
01:12:39,545 --> 01:12:41,464
- Good night.
- Good night.

837
01:12:42,089 --> 01:12:43,466
Feel better.

838
01:13:03,444 --> 01:13:06,155
I'm sorry you're not
going away any more.

839
01:13:07,365 --> 01:13:09,700
I know it was important to you.

840
01:13:10,951 --> 01:13:15,373
Don't take this wrong,
but I've been there.

841
01:13:16,248 --> 01:13:19,085
They don't have so much
we don't have here.

842
01:13:19,752 --> 01:13:21,879
It didn't have to be Paris.

843
01:13:23,297 --> 01:13:26,926
You just wanted out, huh?

844
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:28,928
I wanted in.

845
01:13:32,431 --> 01:13:36,060
I just wanted us to live again.

846
01:13:41,774 --> 01:13:44,735
For years,
I thought we shared this secret.

847
01:13:47,863 --> 01:13:50,574
That we would be
wonderful in the world.

848
01:13:54,286 --> 01:13:56,789
I didn't exactly know how, but just...

849
01:13:58,457 --> 01:14:00,918
Just the possibility kept me hoping.

850
01:14:08,134 --> 01:14:09,969
How pathetic is that?

851
01:14:11,971 --> 01:14:13,389
So stupid.

852
01:14:15,808 --> 01:14:20,896
To put all your hopes in a promise
that was never made?

853
01:14:24,942 --> 01:14:27,820
See, Frank knows.
He knows what he wants.

854
01:14:28,154 --> 01:14:30,781
He's found his place. He's just fine.

855
01:14:32,199 --> 01:14:33,909
Married, two kids.

856
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:40,791
It should be enough.

857
01:14:46,172 --> 01:14:47,631
It is for him.

858
01:14:52,386 --> 01:14:53,888
And he's right.

859
01:14:56,515 --> 01:15:00,144
We were never special or destined
or anything at all.

860
01:15:00,686 --> 01:15:02,355
Yes, you are.

861
01:15:03,898 --> 01:15:05,191
You're...

862
01:15:06,901 --> 01:15:08,652
You're the Wheelers.

863
01:15:08,861 --> 01:15:11,781
You're a terrific couple.
Everybody says so.

864
01:15:13,157 --> 01:15:15,326
I saw a whole other future.

865
01:15:18,913 --> 01:15:20,831
I can't stop seeing it.

866
01:15:26,087 --> 01:15:27,463
Can't leave,

867
01:15:29,715 --> 01:15:31,133
can't stay.

868
01:15:33,511 --> 01:15:35,346
No damn use to anyone.

869
01:15:43,437 --> 01:15:44,689
Come on.

870
01:15:46,273 --> 01:15:47,650
Let's do it.

871
01:16:57,428 --> 01:16:58,596
Let me take you somewhere.

872
01:16:58,721 --> 01:17:02,058
No. Just do it here. Now.

873
01:17:49,021 --> 01:17:50,147
April.

874
01:17:52,900 --> 01:17:55,194
This is what I've always wanted.

875
01:17:56,696 --> 01:17:57,989
I love you.

876
01:17:59,031 --> 01:18:00,574
Don't say that.

877
01:18:02,201 --> 01:18:05,788
No. I mean it, I love you.

878
01:18:05,913 --> 01:18:09,750
Please, just be quiet for a minute.

879
01:18:14,213 --> 01:18:16,340
Then you can take me home.

880
01:19:07,308 --> 01:19:09,018
It's beautiful out.

881
01:19:10,269 --> 01:19:11,687
Yes, it is.

882
01:19:16,650 --> 01:19:18,569
You know what today is?

883
01:19:19,111 --> 01:19:21,572
- It's 12 weeks.
- That's right.

884
01:19:25,618 --> 01:19:29,080
Look, this has been
kind of a crazy summer.

885
01:19:29,246 --> 01:19:31,248
We've both been under a strain.

886
01:19:31,374 --> 01:19:34,085
I mean, I understand why you're upset.

887
01:19:34,794 --> 01:19:38,589
You know I'm not sleeping with you,
and you want to know why.

888
01:19:40,007 --> 01:19:44,804
Well, I'm sorry, Frank,
but I really don't feel like talking about it.

889
01:19:45,513 --> 01:19:48,516
All right.
Then what should we talk about, April?

890
01:19:48,641 --> 01:19:52,019
Would it be all right
if we didn't talk about anything?

891
01:19:52,144 --> 01:19:55,731
I mean, can't we just take each day
as it comes, and do the best we can,

892
01:19:55,856 --> 01:19:59,443
and not feel like we have to talk
about everything all the time?

893
01:19:59,568 --> 01:20:02,905
I don't think I'm suggesting that
we talk about everything all the time.

894
01:20:03,030 --> 01:20:07,201
Look, my point is we've both been
under a strain

895
01:20:07,326 --> 01:20:11,497
and we ought to be helping each other
out as much as we can right now.

896
01:20:11,664 --> 01:20:15,584
I mean, God knows my own behaviour
has been pretty weird lately.

897
01:20:18,212 --> 01:20:22,299
As a matter of fact, there is something
I'd like to tell you about.

898
01:20:24,176 --> 01:20:27,596
I've been with a girl a few times,
in the city.

899
01:20:29,432 --> 01:20:31,642
A girl I hardly even know.

900
01:20:32,184 --> 01:20:34,812
It was nothing to me,

901
01:20:34,937 --> 01:20:38,899
but it's over now, really over.

902
01:20:39,734 --> 01:20:43,487
And if I weren't sure of that, I guess
I could never have told you about it.

903
01:20:48,868 --> 01:20:50,328
Why did you?

904
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:52,872
Baby, I don't know.

905
01:20:53,497 --> 01:20:56,000
I think it's a simple case
of wanting to be a man again

906
01:20:56,125 --> 01:20:57,793
after all that abortion business.

907
01:20:57,918 --> 01:21:01,547
Some kind of neurotic,
irrational need to prove something.

908
01:21:01,714 --> 01:21:04,967
No. I don't mean
why did you have the girl.

909
01:21:05,092 --> 01:21:07,845
I mean, why did you tell me about it?

910
01:21:10,348 --> 01:21:13,392
- What do you mean?
- I mean, what's the point?

911
01:21:15,603 --> 01:21:18,856
Is it supposed to make me jealous
or something?

912
01:21:18,981 --> 01:21:20,775
Is it supposed to make me
fall in love with you,

913
01:21:20,900 --> 01:21:23,652
or back into bed with you, or what?

914
01:21:23,778 --> 01:21:27,406
I mean,
what would you like me to say, Frank?

915
01:21:29,116 --> 01:21:31,744
Why don't you say what you feel, April?

916
01:21:32,912 --> 01:21:34,747
I don't feel anything.

917
01:21:35,456 --> 01:21:39,543
In other words, you don't care what I do
or who I fuck or anything?

918
01:21:43,255 --> 01:21:46,509
No, I guess that's right. I don't.

919
01:21:48,969 --> 01:21:50,596
Fuck who you like.

920
01:21:51,013 --> 01:21:54,183
April, don't you understand
that I want you to care?

921
01:21:54,308 --> 01:21:56,435
I know. I know you do.

922
01:21:57,645 --> 01:21:59,855
And I suppose I would if I loved you.

923
01:21:59,980 --> 01:22:03,109
But I don't think I do any more.
And I only just figured that out.

924
01:22:03,234 --> 01:22:06,612
And that's why I'd just as soon
not do any talking right now.

925
01:22:06,737 --> 01:22:09,115
Don't give me that shit, April.
Don't give me that.

926
01:22:09,281 --> 01:22:11,867
- You know goddamn well you love me.
- You think so?

927
01:22:11,993 --> 01:22:13,786
You know goddamn well!

928
01:22:15,871 --> 01:22:17,331
Anyone home?

929
01:22:21,836 --> 01:22:24,880
I'm sorry dinner's late.
Would anyone like another drink?

930
01:22:25,006 --> 01:22:28,718
Don't worry.
It's nice to just sit a bit and socialise.

931
01:22:29,010 --> 01:22:30,636
You shouldn't have gone to
all this trouble.

932
01:22:30,761 --> 01:22:32,430
With all your packing and whatnot.

933
01:22:32,555 --> 01:22:36,308
I imagine you have a lot on your plate.
No pun intended.

934
01:22:37,810 --> 01:22:39,979
Actually, there's been
a change of plans.

935
01:22:40,980 --> 01:22:43,274
I thought maybe it was obvious.

936
01:22:43,399 --> 01:22:44,650
April here is pregnant.

937
01:22:44,775 --> 01:22:47,820
- Congratulations.
- Oh, April!

938
01:22:47,987 --> 01:22:51,115
I can't tell you how pleased I am!

939
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:53,826
But I expect you'll be needing
a bigger house now, won't you?

940
01:22:53,951 --> 01:22:56,746
Hold it a second, Ma.
Hold on a second, Ma.

941
01:22:56,871 --> 01:23:00,791
I don't get this.
I mean, what's so obvious about it?

942
01:23:00,916 --> 01:23:05,671
I mean, okay, she's pregnant, so what?
Don't people have babies in Europe?

943
01:23:05,838 --> 01:23:07,465
- John...
- Suppose we just say

944
01:23:07,590 --> 01:23:10,468
that people anywhere
aren't very well advised to have babies

945
01:23:10,593 --> 01:23:12,678
unless they can afford them.

946
01:23:13,387 --> 01:23:18,017
Okay. Okay, it's a question of money.
Money's a good reason.

947
01:23:18,142 --> 01:23:22,480
But it's hardly ever the real reason.

948
01:23:22,605 --> 01:23:27,777
What's the real reason?
Wife talk you out of it or what?

949
01:23:28,361 --> 01:23:32,281
Little woman decide she isn't
quite ready to quit playing house?

950
01:23:33,407 --> 01:23:35,743
No, no, that's not it. I can tell.

951
01:23:35,868 --> 01:23:38,954
She looks too tough
and adequate as hell.

952
01:23:40,915 --> 01:23:45,544
Okay, then. It must've been you.
What happened?

953
01:23:45,670 --> 01:23:50,216
- John, please. You're being very rude.
- No, no. What happened, Frank?

954
01:23:55,680 --> 01:23:56,972
You get cold feet?

955
01:23:57,098 --> 01:24:00,309
You decide
you're better off here after all?

956
01:24:01,102 --> 01:24:05,231
You figure it's more comfy

957
01:24:05,356 --> 01:24:09,819
here in the old hopeless emptiness
after all, huh?

958
01:24:10,945 --> 01:24:14,740
Oh, wow, that did it. Look at his face.

959
01:24:14,865 --> 01:24:17,076
What's the matter, Wheeler?
Am I getting warm?

960
01:24:17,243 --> 01:24:20,579
- All right, Son. I think we'd better be...
- You know something?

961
01:24:20,746 --> 01:24:23,582
I wouldn't be surprised
if he knocked her up on purpose

962
01:24:23,749 --> 01:24:27,378
just so he could spend the rest of his
life hiding behind a maternity dress.

963
01:24:27,503 --> 01:24:30,715
That way he'd never have to find out
what he's really made of.

964
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:34,427
Now look, I think that's just about
enough out of you.

965
01:24:35,094 --> 01:24:37,346
I mean, who the hell
do you think you are?

966
01:24:37,471 --> 01:24:38,848
You come in here and say

967
01:24:38,973 --> 01:24:41,934
whatever crazy goddamn thing
comes into your head,

968
01:24:42,101 --> 01:24:45,354
and I think it's about time somebody told
you to keep your goddamn mouth shut.

969
01:24:45,479 --> 01:24:48,441
- He's not well, Frank.
- Not well, my ass!

970
01:24:48,733 --> 01:24:52,445
I don't give a damn
if he's sick or well or dead or alive,

971
01:24:52,570 --> 01:24:54,196
he should keep his fucking opinions

972
01:24:54,322 --> 01:24:57,783
in the fucking insane asylum
where they belong!

973
01:25:00,828 --> 01:25:03,205
- Let's go, Son.
- Come on, John.

974
01:25:07,668 --> 01:25:10,379
Big man you got there, April.

975
01:25:11,005 --> 01:25:12,965
Big family man.

976
01:25:16,677 --> 01:25:18,637
I feel sorry for you.

977
01:25:21,349 --> 01:25:24,810
Still, maybe you deserve each other.

978
01:25:24,935 --> 01:25:29,565
I mean, the way you look right now,
I'm beginning to feel sorry for him, too.

979
01:25:31,150 --> 01:25:33,486
You must give him a pretty bad time

980
01:25:33,611 --> 01:25:37,490
if making babies is the only way
he can prove he's got a pair of balls.

981
01:25:37,782 --> 01:25:42,328
- You fucking...
- No! He's not well, Frank!

982
01:25:54,173 --> 01:25:57,635
All right, John.
Let's get on out to the car now.

983
01:26:03,474 --> 01:26:06,352
April, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

984
01:26:06,519 --> 01:26:11,107
Oh, right. Sorry. Sorry! Sorry!

985
01:26:11,232 --> 01:26:14,151
Ma, have I said
"I'm sorry" enough times?

986
01:26:14,276 --> 01:26:16,529
Damn! I am sorry, too.

987
01:26:16,654 --> 01:26:19,532
I bet I'm just about
the sorriest bastard I know.

988
01:26:19,699 --> 01:26:23,786
But get right down to it, I don't have
a whole hell of a lot to be glad about.

989
01:26:23,911 --> 01:26:24,996
Do I?

990
01:26:27,748 --> 01:26:29,667
But, hey, you know what?

991
01:26:31,043 --> 01:26:33,045
I am glad about one thing.

992
01:26:33,713 --> 01:26:35,965
You want to know what I'm glad about?

993
01:26:38,426 --> 01:26:41,012
I'm glad I'm not gonna be that kid.

994
01:26:58,612 --> 01:27:02,074
Okay, okay, don't tell me.

995
01:27:02,700 --> 01:27:04,744
Don't tell me, let me guess.

996
01:27:05,411 --> 01:27:08,914
I made a disgusting spectacle
of myself, right?

997
01:27:10,708 --> 01:27:11,751
Right.

998
01:27:11,876 --> 01:27:13,419
And everything that man said
is true, right?

999
01:27:13,586 --> 01:27:15,338
Is that what you're going to say?

1000
01:27:15,463 --> 01:27:17,548
Apparently I don't have to.

1001
01:27:17,673 --> 01:27:20,593
- You're saying it for me.
- Well, you're wrong, April.

1002
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:24,430
- Really? Why am I wrong?
- Because the man is insane.

1003
01:27:24,555 --> 01:27:27,767
He's fucking insane! Do you know what
the definition of insanity is?

1004
01:27:27,892 --> 01:27:29,018
No. Do you?

1005
01:27:29,143 --> 01:27:32,605
Yes, it's the inability
to relate to another human being.

1006
01:27:32,730 --> 01:27:34,774
It's the inability to love.

1007
01:27:39,820 --> 01:27:42,448
April. April.

1008
01:27:43,115 --> 01:27:45,785
April! April!

1009
01:27:45,951 --> 01:27:50,122
The inability... The inability to love.

1010
01:27:51,999 --> 01:27:54,960
Frank. You really are a wonderful talker.

1011
01:27:55,086 --> 01:27:58,381
If black could be made into white
by talking,

1012
01:27:58,506 --> 01:28:00,466
you'd be the man for the job.

1013
01:28:00,633 --> 01:28:03,094
So now I'm crazy
because I don't love you. Right?

1014
01:28:03,219 --> 01:28:05,262
- Is that the point?
- No. Wrong.

1015
01:28:05,388 --> 01:28:09,308
You're not crazy and you do love me.
That's the point, April.

1016
01:28:09,809 --> 01:28:12,978
But I don't. I hate you.

1017
01:28:13,604 --> 01:28:16,315
You were just some boy
who made me laugh at a party once

1018
01:28:16,482 --> 01:28:18,943
and now I loathe the sight of you.

1019
01:28:19,527 --> 01:28:23,072
In fact, if you come any closer,
if you touch me or anything,

1020
01:28:23,197 --> 01:28:24,991
I think I'll scream.

1021
01:28:26,325 --> 01:28:28,327
Come on. Stop this, April.

1022
01:28:33,874 --> 01:28:35,835
Fuck you, April!

1023
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:39,338
Fuck you and all your hateful,
snotty little...

1024
01:28:39,463 --> 01:28:42,133
What're you going to do now?
Are you going to hit me?

1025
01:28:42,258 --> 01:28:45,261
- To show me how much you love me?
- Don't worry, I can't be bothered!

1026
01:28:45,469 --> 01:28:48,097
You're not worth the trouble
it would take to hit you.

1027
01:28:48,222 --> 01:28:50,850
You're not worth the powder
it would take to blow you up.

1028
01:28:51,017 --> 01:28:55,271
You're an empty, empty,
hollow shell of a woman!

1029
01:28:56,397 --> 01:29:00,359
What the hell are you doing in my house
if you hate me so much?

1030
01:29:00,985 --> 01:29:03,195
Why the hell are you married to me?

1031
01:29:03,321 --> 01:29:06,157
What the hell are you doing
carrying my child?

1032
01:29:06,282 --> 01:29:08,951
I mean, why didn't you just get
rid of it when you had the chance?

1033
01:29:09,076 --> 01:29:12,038
Because listen to me.
Listen to me, I got news for you.

1034
01:29:12,204 --> 01:29:14,332
I wish to God that you had.

1035
01:29:48,449 --> 01:29:49,659
April!

1036
01:29:52,328 --> 01:29:53,496
April!

1037
01:29:58,209 --> 01:29:59,377
April!

1038
01:30:04,799 --> 01:30:05,925
April!

1039
01:30:11,222 --> 01:30:12,390
April!

1040
01:30:14,308 --> 01:30:15,434
April!

1041
01:30:23,651 --> 01:30:25,528
- April!
- Stay away from me.

1042
01:30:25,695 --> 01:30:27,697
- April, listen.
- Stay away from me.

1043
01:30:27,822 --> 01:30:29,699
Can't I even get away from you
in the fucking woods?

1044
01:30:29,824 --> 01:30:31,784
April, listen, I didn't mean that.

1045
01:30:31,909 --> 01:30:34,245
- Honestly, I didn't mean what I said.
- Are you still talking?

1046
01:30:34,370 --> 01:30:37,123
Isn't there any way to stop your talking?

1047
01:30:37,832 --> 01:30:41,377
I need to think. Can't you see that?
I need to think.

1048
01:30:43,838 --> 01:30:45,589
Please come back to the house.
What're you doing out here, April?

1049
01:30:45,715 --> 01:30:47,258
Do you want me to scream again,
Frank?

1050
01:30:47,383 --> 01:30:49,552
Because I will! I mean it!

1051
01:30:58,269 --> 01:31:00,688
Okay. Okay.

1052
01:34:33,985 --> 01:34:35,444
Good morning.

1053
01:34:37,571 --> 01:34:39,031
Good morning.

1054
01:34:40,825 --> 01:34:43,452
Would you like
scrambled eggs or fried?

1055
01:34:48,416 --> 01:34:49,959
I don't know.

1056
01:34:50,751 --> 01:34:55,798
It doesn't really matter.
Scrambled, I guess, if it's easy.

1057
01:34:56,590 --> 01:34:59,552
Fine. I'll have scrambled, too.

1058
01:35:57,526 --> 01:36:01,864
It's kind of nice having breakfast
without the kids for a change, huh?

1059
01:36:01,989 --> 01:36:03,115
Yes.

1060
01:36:04,075 --> 01:36:06,952
I thought you'd probably want
a good breakfast today.

1061
01:36:07,078 --> 01:36:10,289
I mean, it's kind of an important day
for you, isn't it?

1062
01:36:11,165 --> 01:36:14,669
Isn't this the day you have
your conference with Pollock?

1063
01:36:16,837 --> 01:36:19,090
Yes. Yes, that's right.

1064
01:36:21,175 --> 01:36:25,054
- Big deal.
- I imagine it is a pretty big deal.

1065
01:36:25,763 --> 01:36:27,473
For them, anyway.

1066
01:36:28,766 --> 01:36:32,395
What exactly do you think
you'll be doing in your new job?

1067
01:36:32,812 --> 01:36:35,564
You haven't really
told me much about it.

1068
01:36:36,440 --> 01:36:37,817
Haven't I?

1069
01:36:40,027 --> 01:36:42,196
Well, I think this whole thing
is about Knox getting ready

1070
01:36:42,321 --> 01:36:45,574
to buy up one of those
really big computers,

1071
01:36:45,700 --> 01:36:47,785
even bigger than the 500.

1072
01:36:48,828 --> 01:36:52,164
- Didn't I tell you about that?
- No.

1073
01:36:52,873 --> 01:36:54,875
Why don't you tell me now?

1074
01:36:59,213 --> 01:37:00,256
Well,

1075
01:37:01,674 --> 01:37:06,095
you know, basically it's just a big,
fast adding machine.

1076
01:37:07,805 --> 01:37:11,475
Only, instead of mechanical parts,
you see,

1077
01:37:12,226 --> 01:37:17,523
you've got thousands
of individual vacuum tubes.

1078
01:37:28,409 --> 01:37:29,618
I see.

1079
01:37:37,501 --> 01:37:39,503
At least I think I see.

1080
01:37:43,382 --> 01:37:46,385
Yes, it's really kind of interesting,
isn't it?

1081
01:37:49,055 --> 01:37:50,848
Well, I don't know.

1082
01:37:52,933 --> 01:37:56,062
Yeah, I guess it is kind of interesting,
in a way.

1083
01:38:00,900 --> 01:38:03,444
You should value what you do, Frank.

1084
01:38:04,737 --> 01:38:06,864
You're obviously good at it.

1085
01:38:22,338 --> 01:38:25,508
Well, I guess
I'd better be getting started, huh?

1086
01:38:32,431 --> 01:38:34,725
Listen, though, April, the...

1087
01:38:36,852 --> 01:38:38,604
This was really nice.

1088
01:38:40,272 --> 01:38:43,317
I mean, it was a swell breakfast.
Really, I...

1089
01:38:44,235 --> 01:38:47,530
I don't know when I've ever had
a nicer breakfast.

1090
01:38:49,824 --> 01:38:53,703
Thank you. I enjoyed it, too.

1091
01:39:15,516 --> 01:39:19,603
Then you don't...
You don't hate me or anything?

1092
01:39:22,273 --> 01:39:25,943
No. No, of course I don't.

1093
01:39:36,746 --> 01:39:38,331
Have a good day.

1094
01:39:45,129 --> 01:39:48,841
Okay, then. So long.

1095
01:41:31,110 --> 01:41:35,614
Hello. Milly? Everything all right?

1096
01:41:37,950 --> 01:41:42,538
Well, no, I'm afraid I'm not feeling
any better. That's really why I called.

1097
01:41:44,123 --> 01:41:48,169
If it's not an inconvenience for you,
this evening would be great.

1098
01:41:49,211 --> 01:41:50,212
What?

1099
01:41:52,965 --> 01:41:57,928
Oh, no. No.
Not if they're outdoors playing.

1100
01:41:59,180 --> 01:42:00,181
No.

1101
01:42:02,266 --> 01:42:04,310
Don't call them in.

1102
01:42:04,435 --> 01:42:08,773
Just give them each a kiss for me,

1103
01:42:10,399 --> 01:42:12,276
and tell them I...

1104
01:42:13,986 --> 01:42:15,446
Tell them...

1105
01:42:16,781 --> 01:42:22,620
You know. All right. All right.
Thank you, Milly. Bye.

1106
01:45:54,498 --> 01:45:57,209
I think I need help.

1107
01:45:58,753 --> 01:46:02,673
115 Revolutionary Road.

1108
01:46:29,575 --> 01:46:32,328
- Frank. They tell you what happened?
- Jesus Christ.

1109
01:46:32,453 --> 01:46:34,955
Shep, I didn't understand
half the things he told me.

1110
01:46:35,081 --> 01:46:37,833
He said the foetus was out
before they got her here.

1111
01:46:37,958 --> 01:46:42,630
And they had to operate to take out
the, what do you call it, the placenta?

1112
01:46:42,755 --> 01:46:45,049
And now she's still bleeding.

1113
01:46:45,174 --> 01:46:47,843
He said that she'd lost a lot of blood
before the ambulance came,

1114
01:46:47,968 --> 01:46:50,346
and now they're trying to stop it.

1115
01:46:50,596 --> 01:46:54,934
He said a whole lot of things
I didn't understand about capillaries...

1116
01:46:55,685 --> 01:47:00,022
He said that she's unconscious. Jesus.

1117
01:47:00,147 --> 01:47:01,983
Okay, Frank,
why don't you just take a seat?

1118
01:47:02,108 --> 01:47:04,443
What the hell do I want to sit down for,
for God's sake?

1119
01:47:04,568 --> 01:47:08,698
Okay, Frank. Just take it easy.
Take it easy.

1120
01:47:11,158 --> 01:47:14,578
- Frank, have a cigarette.
- She did it to herself, Shep.

1121
01:47:16,580 --> 01:47:18,499
She did it to herself.

1122
01:47:26,132 --> 01:47:28,342
I'm gonna get you some coffee.

1123
01:48:38,704 --> 01:48:42,792
They were such wonderful people.
Weren't they, Shep?

1124
01:48:43,668 --> 01:48:48,339
It's just devastating. Poor April.

1125
01:48:48,464 --> 01:48:49,757
Thank you.

1126
01:48:51,008 --> 01:48:54,428
Frank lives in the city now.
Where is it that he works?

1127
01:48:55,513 --> 01:48:57,973
- Bart Pollock Associates.
- Computers?

1128
01:48:59,308 --> 01:49:01,185
Interesting firm.

1129
01:49:01,310 --> 01:49:04,563
- Have you seen him since?
- No. Not back here.

1130
01:49:04,689 --> 01:49:08,943
There are too many memories, I think.
Shep has seen him in the city.

1131
01:49:09,068 --> 01:49:10,945
Haven't you, sweetie?

1132
01:49:11,529 --> 01:49:14,615
Frank is just devoted to those kids.

1133
01:49:15,533 --> 01:49:18,577
Every spare moment he has,
he spends with them.

1134
01:49:33,801 --> 01:49:35,094
Excuse me.

1135
01:49:46,397 --> 01:49:47,898
You all right?

1136
01:49:53,321 --> 01:49:56,532
I don't want to talk
about the Wheelers any more.

1137
01:49:58,117 --> 01:49:59,160
Okay.

1138
01:50:01,495 --> 01:50:03,205
We don't have to.

1139
01:50:05,124 --> 01:50:06,834
We don't have to.

1140
01:50:49,001 --> 01:50:51,712
Daddy, Daddy, watch. Watch, Daddy.

1141
01:50:57,760 --> 01:50:59,428
I can't tell you how pleased I am

1142
01:50:59,553 --> 01:51:02,723
about the little Revolutionary Road
place, Howard.

1143
01:51:03,182 --> 01:51:06,102
And now whenever I drive past,
it gives me such a lift

1144
01:51:06,227 --> 01:51:09,814
to see it all perked up
and spanking clean again.

1145
01:51:10,439 --> 01:51:12,817
All the lights in all the windows.

1146
01:51:13,943 --> 01:51:18,114
And do you know? I was just thinking,
I've loved that little house for years.

1147
01:51:18,239 --> 01:51:22,702
And the Braces are the only really
suitable people I've ever found for it.

1148
01:51:23,327 --> 01:51:26,122
Really nice, congenial people, I mean.

1149
01:51:26,247 --> 01:51:28,916
Well, except for the Wheelers,
you mean.

1150
01:51:30,960 --> 01:51:33,337
I was very fond of the Wheelers.

1151
01:51:34,213 --> 01:51:37,633
They were a bit whimsical for my taste.
A bit neurotic.

1152
01:51:38,801 --> 01:51:40,094
I never stressed it, but they were often

1153
01:51:40,219 --> 01:51:43,347
very trying people
to deal with, in many ways.

1154
01:51:44,682 --> 01:51:49,437
And actually, the main reason
that the little house was so hard to sell

1155
01:51:49,603 --> 01:51:52,690
was because they let it depreciate
so dreadfully.

1156
01:51:52,815 --> 01:51:58,446
Warped window frames, wet cellar,
crayon marks all over the walls,

1157
01:51:58,571 --> 01:52:01,532
filthy smudges around the door knobs
and the fixtures...
