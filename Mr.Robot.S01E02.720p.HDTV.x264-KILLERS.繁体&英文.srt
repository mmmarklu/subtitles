你得來趟眾安
I need you to come to AllSafe.

00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,620
該死  他們進入網絡了
Shit. They're in the network?

36
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,600
就是這個  去社會
This is it. Fsociety.

37
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,380
他們叫我留著它
They're telling me to leave it here.

38
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:20,200
你是誰
Who are you?

39
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,410
我覺得你該跟我來
I think you should come with me.

40
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,020
嗯  那是達琳
Yeah, that's Darlene.

41
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,060
你要修改那個dat文件
You are going to modify the dat file

42
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:26,540
把科比的IP放進去
put Colby's IP in there.

43
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:27,400
你照做
You do that,

44
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:31,120
你就啟動了有史以來最大規模的革命
you have set in motion the largest revolution the world will ever see.

45
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,610
消息源確認黑客行為
sources have confirmed the hacks were

46
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:37,870
與科比的終端有一定關系
in part tied to Colby's terminal.

47
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:39,670
先生  請上車
Sir, step inside the car.

48
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:47,570
你好啊  艾略特
Bon soir, Elliot.

49
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,950
"給人一把槍  他就能搶銀行
"Give a man a gun and he can rob a bank,

50
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,630
但給人一座銀行  他就能洗劫整個世界"
but give a man a bank, and he can rob the world."

51
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,950
其實這說法挺蠢的
It's a bit of a silly expression, actually.

52
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,000
有點武斷了  但是...
A little reductive, but still...

53
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:24,440
我喜歡
I like it,

54
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,480
跟大部分人討厭這說法的原因一樣
for the same reason most people hate it,

55
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,840
因為我認為這話的意思是
because to me it means that 

56
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,370
權力屬于肯去奪取的人
power belongs to the people that take it.

57
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:34,550
和他們的努力  強大的野心
Nothing to do with their hard work, strong ambitions,

58
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:36,790
或者資歷之類的都無關
or rightful qualifications, no.

59
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:42,500
通常  只有奪取的意愿才是最重要的
The actual will to take is often the only thing that's necessary.

60
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:46,030
很抱歉用這種方式把你帶過來
I'm sorry to bring you in like this.

61
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,130
嚴格說  我們這樣做可能是違法的
Technically what we're doing might be considered illegal,

62
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,820
所以我身邊才坐著
which is why I'm surrounded

63
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,960
11位最煩人的律師
by eleven of our most annoying lawyers.

64
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:58,120
艾略特·奧德森
Elliot Alderson...

65
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,570
我想為你提供
I want to offer you

66
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:06,340
邪惡公司供職的機會
a position here at Evil Corp.

67
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,730
我想要你來主管我們的網絡安全部
I want you to head our cybersecurity division.

68
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,030
但是由于我們和你的雇主  眾安
Except I can't officially offer you anything

69
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,430
有競業禁止協議  所以我不能正式聘用你
since we have this non-compete with your employer, Allsafe.

70
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,790
但如果你能自愿跳槽
But if you do this of your own accord--

71
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,450
你跳槽以后
when you do this--

72
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:26,380
五年內就能坐擁百萬家產
you'll be a multi-millionaire within the next five years.

73
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,560
你覺得怎么樣
What do you say?

74
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,470
我能...
Can I--

75
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,190
我能考慮一下嗎
Can I think about it?

76
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,510
先生們  讓我們單獨談談
Gentlemen, I need the room.

77
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,040
我知道  謝謝  謝謝
Yes, thank you. Yes, yes.

78
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:13,790
你知道嗎
You know,

79
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:18,790
邪惡公司剛任命我為臨時首席技術官
Evil Corp has just named me interim CTO.

80
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,620
過不了多久就會正式上任
It won't be long until it's official.

81
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:26,030
我將會成為這家公司有史以來最年輕的高管
I will be the youngest executive this company has ever seen.

82
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:29,400
我真應該找到那些黑客
I should track down these hackers out there

83
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,820
以表謝意
just to thank them.

84
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,430
這可以說有點...
In a way, it's kind of, um...

85
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,240
那個詞怎么說來著
What's the word in English?

86
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,440
誤打誤撞  對吧
Serendipitous? Right?

87
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,930
到本季度末
You know, by the end of the quarter,

88
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,400
我們準備重新構建網絡系統
we're going to revamp our entire network

89
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,890
并加固安全協議
and consolidate our security protocols.

90
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:06,050
所有事情我們都會內部解決
We're going to handle everything internally,

91
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:10,150
也就是說我們會中止和所有供應商的合同
which means all of our vendors, including Allsafe,

92
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,640
包括眾安
will be cut loose.

93
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,280
眾所周知  眾安沒了我們這個客戶
And it's no secret that once Allsafe loses us as a client,

94
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,480
就會完蛋
they'll be fini.

95
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,750
到了那時候
And when that happens,

96
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,090
我希望你能跟我一起在這里
I want you to be where you belong:

97
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:22,840
你屬于這里
here with me.

98
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,580
這個選擇非常重要  艾略特
This is an important choice you're making, Elliot.

99
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,490
我只是想在你做出最終決定之前
I just wanted you to know all the facts

100
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:31,620
讓你了解清楚情況
before you made your final decision.

101
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:46,390
我現在待在那兒很開心
I think I'm happy where I am.

102
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,690
我總得試試
Well, I thought I'd ask.

103
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,530
如果想聯系威利克先生就打這個電話
Call this number if you need to get in touch with Mr. Wellick.

104
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:01,180
你可以叫我X先生
You can call me Mr. X.

105
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,190
怎么  沒看過《刺殺肯尼迪》嗎
Come on, you've never seen JFK?

106
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,190
{\an3}《刺殺肯尼迪》中的
神秘人物

107
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:09,530
奧利弗·斯通的那部
Oliver Stone movie?

108
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,040
先生  老實說  這太丟人了
Sir, I gotta be honest. That's embarrassing.

109
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,480
去看看那部電影吧  對你有好處
Do yourself a favor and watch it.

110
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,950
而且  老老實實付費吧
And pay, for Christ's sake.

111
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,080
你現在可以叫我薩瑟蘭先生
Anyway, you can call me Mr. Sutherland for now.

112
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,290
準備好了后不要猶豫  直接打給我
Don't hesitate to reach me when you're ready.

113
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,870
我們就在你附近
We're always close by.

114
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,980
我這就安排日子...
I'm gonna set a date right now--

115
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,010
-不要  -以供后用
- No, we're not. - For later.

116
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:40,390
我得走了  非常感謝
I gotta go, thank you very much.

117
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,840
-要我上去嗎  -不要
- You gonna have me up? - No.

118
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,440
-要邀請我上去嗎  -不要啦  住手
- Gonna have me up? - No, stop.

119
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,930
-我要上去  -不  你不能上去
- I'm coming up. - No, you're not coming up.

120
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,490
下次行嗎  我得走了
Another time. Okay, I gotta go.

121
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,470
別這樣
Come on.

122
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:57,370
-沒事吧  -沒事  他就是個變態
- Everything all right? - Yeah, he's just a creeper.

123
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,880
我最討厭不識趣的雇主了
I hate it when your employers can't take a hint.

124
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,370
你的散熱器壞了嗎
Hey, is your radiator messed up?

125
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:10,000
我房間里簡直是蒸籠
Because it's like 3,000 degrees in my apartment.

126
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:15,240
你沒事吧  你看起來有點不在狀態
Hey, are you okay? You seem off.

127
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,670
順便問問  能再給我一點嗎
While we're here, you mind if I reup?

128
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,990
現在就要有點早吧
A little early to reup, don't you think?

129
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,710
我有點偏離原計劃了
I'm deviating from the schedule a little.

130
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,760
沒想到你也有這一天啊  一絲不茍先生
Whoa, never thought I'd see the day, Mr. Stricty Pants,

131
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,730
不過行吧
but okie dokie.

132
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,390
該死  另一種用光了
Oh, yeah. Shit, I'm out of the other ones.

133
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,720
不  給我嗎啡就好
No, just the morphine. It's good.

134
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:38,630
不行  你讓我向你保證  賽寶松
Uh, no, you made me promise never to give you these

135
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,030
必須跟嗎啡一起給你的
unless I had your Subs.

136
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,660
-夏拉  -不  艾略特
- Shayla. - No, Elliot.

137
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,490
一諾千金
Promises matter, okay?

138
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:47,620
我很認真的
I take this shit to heart.

139
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,820
天吶
Oh, my God.

140
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,890
行吧  但你得保證在我幫你搞到戒癮藥之前
Fine, but you have to promise me you won't do a lot

141
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,600
你不會用太多
until I get your withdrawal meds, okay?

142
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,610
我稍后去找費爾南
I'll go see Fernando later or something.

143
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:03,570
不  你得說出來
No, you have to say it.

144
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:08,400
我保證
I promise.

145
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:20,040
伙計
Hey, man.

146
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:23,110
怎么了  你以為我忘掉你了嗎
What, you think I forgot about you?

147
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:25,210
相信我  我現在比以往更需要你
Trust me, I need you now more than ever.

148
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,830
得開始干活兒了
We gotta get to work.

149
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,460
黑提利爾·威利克按理說該是難事
Hacking Tyrell Wellick, you'd think it'd be tricky,

150
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,960
但并不是  邪惡公司的企業郵箱服務器
but it wasn't--Evil Corp's corporate mail servers,

151
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,220
自從《炮彈休克癥 》[1964]之后就再無改良了
they haven't patched anything since Shellshock.

152
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,040
甚至連雙步驗證登錄都不用
He doesn't even use two-step verification.

153
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,830
密碼不過是妻子的婚前姓
His password was just his wife's maiden name

154
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:44,520
加上瑞典的獨立日6月6號
and Sweden's independence date, 6-6.

155
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,930
再加個6就體現他們的邪惡本質了[666是魔鬼]
One six away from the obvious, but still,

156
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:48,890
但也還是未免太簡單
this is bad noob practice.

157
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:51,230
{\an8}郵箱代理

158
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,900
這些郵件
These emails...

159
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:00,960
他的生活  美好  幸福  完美
His life... it's nice, happy, perfect.

160
00:08:58,570 --> 00:08:59,190
{\an8}提利爾·威利克

161
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,570
{\an8}提利爾的照片

162
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,540
毫無道理
This doesn't make sense.

163
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,070
難道他知道我會黑他
Did he know I was going to hack him?

164
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,220
這是圈套嗎
Did he let me?

165
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,480
我得把一切都銷毀
I'm gonna need to wipe everything.

166
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,370
我知道  我知道  嗑多了
I know, I know, taking more than I should.

167
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:16,060
我壞了規矩  但這周就是不正常嘛
I'm breaking my rule, but come on, it's an off week.

168
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,340
快點
Come on.

169
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,610
伙計  你得
My man, you gotta--

170
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:04,600
你得在這兒解決  好嗎
You gotta deuce it out over here, all right?

171
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,390
你得在這兒解手  好嗎
Yo, you gotta do your business up in here, all right?

172
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:17,840
你能行的  你能行的
You got this. You got this.

173
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,000
泰瑞·科比  首席技術官...
Terry Colby, the chief technology officer of--

174
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,480
泰瑞·科比被捕的消息占據了大家的注意
Terry Colby's arrest is on everyone's mind.

175
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:53,540
和屏幕  如今這兩者也沒區別了
Screen. Might as well be the same thing nowadays.

176
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:58,570
{\an8}泰瑞·科比被捕撼動技術世界

177
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,650
發生了這事我還要怎么繼續工作啊
How do I go back to work after this?

178
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,520
還怎么能集中注意呢
How can I focus on anything?

179
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:02,070
機器人先生什么時候才會再聯系我啊
And when's Mr. Robot going to contact me again?

180
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,420
他在等什么
What's he waiting for?

181
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,960
我不會是白白毀掉了一個人的生活吧
Did I just destroy a man's life for no reason?

182
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,890
我會跟人力資源說給你加薪
I'm gonna talk to HR about a salary bump for you.

183
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:11,480
-不用了  -不不
- Oh, please. - No, no.

184
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,520
你就接受吧
Take the raise.

185
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:16,240
不會很多  但目前我也只能做這么多
It's not gonna be much, but it's the best I can do right now.

186
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:18,510
艾略特
Elliot...

187
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:20,460
你救了公司
You saved the company.

188
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:25,150
我想知道
Now...

189
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,350
你為什么沒告訴我dat文件的事
Why didn't you tell me about the dat file?

190
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,900
會議之前你完全可以來我這里
You could've come in here at any time before the meeting

191
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,770
告訴我你有了發現  但你沒有
to say you found something, but you didn't.

192
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,950
說實話  我覺得這有點奇怪啊
I gotta be honest. I found that kind of curious.

193
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:44,700
我當時也不知道自己發現了什么
Yeah, I didn't know what I had.

194
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:48,440
也可能是垃圾文件呢
Could've easily been a junk file.

195
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,430
好啦
C'mon...

196
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,870
你從不下定論
You're never sure about anything

197
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,170
除非是真有問題
unless there's something to be sure about.

198
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,060
也許你并沒那么了解我
Maybe you don't know me that well.

199
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,160
不論如何
Regardless,

200
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,700
你還得繼續負責他們  現在更為重要了
I still need you to stay on it, now more than ever.

201
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,100
誰知道那些去社會的黑客接下來會干什么呢
I mean, who knows what these fsociety hackers are going to do next.

202
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:09,980
他說什么
What did he just say?

203
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:12,710
-你說什么  -科比手下那些
- What did you just say? - The ones working with Colby.

204
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,220
誰知道數據公布會達到什么程度
Who knows how deep these data dumps are going to get,

205
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,430
而且邪惡公司
and Evil Corp is--

206
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,840
你在說什么呢
What're you talking about?

207
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,140
真是難得
There's a twist.

208
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,010
一般都是你比我消息靈通
You're usually the one a step ahead of me.

209
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:26,170
入侵時  他們挖到了金礦
They hit the mother lode during the breach.

210
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,480
可能盜取了兆位級的郵件和文件
Potentially terabytes worth of emails and files.

211
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,320
他們威脅聯調局釋放科比
They're threatening to dump everything

212
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,550
否則就拋出所有文件
unless the FBI frees Colby.

213
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,480
今天早上發布了視頻
They released the video this morning.

214
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:57,870
{\an8}邪惡公司黑客入侵并未結束

215
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:47,060
你好  邪惡公司  我們是去社會
Hello, Evil Corp. We are fsociety.

216
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:49,190
這些年來  我們一直在關注你
Over the years, we have been watching you.

217
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,160
你金融欺詐窮人
Your financial abuse of the poor;

218
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,100
腐敗政府官員
your corruption of governments;

219
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,080
掩蓋對無辜平凡市民的謀殺
your cover-ups of the murder of innocent, ordinary citizens,

220
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,100
為利潤干不惜一切
all for the sake of a profit.

221
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,960
所以我們去社會決定你們必須被鏟除
This is why we at fsociety have decided you must die.

222
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:05,950
我們是有惡意的  是敵意的  我們不會妥協
We are malicious and hostile. We do not compromise.

223
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:07,610
我們不會留情
We are relentless.

224
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,620
我們決不罷手  直到斬斷
We will not stop until every tentacle

225
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:13,630
你的每一根邪惡觸角
of your evil monstrosity is sliced off at the nerve.

226
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:16,010
但我們也并非不通情理
But we are also not without mercy.

227
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:18,670
上次的入侵是最后的警告
Our latest hack was our last warning.

228
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:22,410
滿足要求  我們就考慮不毀掉你們
Meet our demands, and we will consider not destroying you.

229
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:24,920
首先  結束你們的非法囚禁
First, release our leader Terry Colby

230
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,230
立刻釋放我們的領袖泰瑞·科比
from your illegitimate prison immediately.

231
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:30,460
第二  撤銷你們給世界上
Second, release all the people of the world

232
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:33,820
無辜平民加諸的非法債務
from your even more illegitimate prisons of debt.

233
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,440
第三  解散你們公司
Third, dissolve your corporation

234
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:40,320
把資產全部捐給世界各地的慈善機構
and donate all your assets to charities around the world.

235
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,960
{\an8}紐約證券交易所

236
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:42,630
我們的要求不可協商
This proposal is non-negotiable.

237
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,290
{\an8}占領華爾街

238
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:45,300
人們已經意識到只要有你們
The people are realizing they don't have freedom of choice

239
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,830
他們就不會有自由選擇權
so long as you exist.

240
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,640
人們在覺醒
The people are waking up,

241
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,550
人民拒絕成為你們的經濟奴隸
no longer accepting your economic slavery.

242
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,260
{\an8}釋放阿桑奇

243
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:55,460
立即滿足我們的要求  否則就滅了你們
Meet these demands, or we will kill you.

244
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,360
警告送達  看著辦吧
Consider yourself warned.

245
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:59,850
{\an8}去社會

246
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,400
再放一遍
Play it again.

247
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,710
走過路過不要錯過  我的專輯出爐了
Yo, yo, yo, yo, my album just dropped.

248
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,470
快來買張CD吧  價格只要20塊
Yo, please buy my CD. Only cost you 20 likes.

249
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,100
保證你聽得爽  我跟你保證
Yo, it'll give you the feels, y'all, I swear.

250
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,220
你要是發個推  我就免費送專輯
The CD's free. All's I ask is you Tweet.

251
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,480
幫我上頭條吧
Help my social media outreach.

252
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:17,910
我當時就想  "我想安排這次見面
You know, be like, "I want to set up this meeting.

253
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,450
這是個非常非常..."
It's like a very, like a--"

254
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:20,710
艾略特
Oh, Elliot!

255
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:22,110
恭喜啊  哥們
Hey, congrats, man.

256
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,790
多謝了你  眾安在網上都紅爆了
Allsafe is all over the internet today because of you.

257
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:27,430
該慶祝一下啊  哥們  我們團購了周四的
Dude, we should celebrate. We have this Groupon

258
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:29,570
莫爾頓牛排坊四人餐
for four at Morton's on Thursday.

259
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:31,760
另外說好的一對突然就不來了
This other couple we were going with totally bailed.

260
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,850
不如你替他們去吃
Why don't you come with?

261
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,910
他們牛排爆好吃  29.95塊就能
Their steaks are badass. It's $29.95--

262
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,390
我覺得艾略特不會有興趣的
I'm not sure that Elliot would like that.

263
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,530
嗯  好
Yeah, okay.

264
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,030
你同意  太好了老兄
Yeah? Okay. Awesome, man.

265
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:42,590
不如我們搞個四人約會算了
And, hey, why don't we make it a double date?

266
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,070
我聽說你有了個女友
I heard that you had a girlfriend.

267
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,410
奧利  你怎么能說出來呢
Ollie, you weren't supposed to say anything.

268
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:47,870
親愛的  沒關系  艾略特不介意的
Babe, it's cool. Elliot's okay with it.

269
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:50,160
嗯  好  可以  我得走了
Yeah, okay, sure. I--have to go.

270
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,660
我鄰居又抱怨我的狗狂叫了
Um, my neighbor's complaining about the dog barking again.

271
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,690
他什么時候養狗了
Since when does he have a dog?

272
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:03,790
你們倆一對璧人兒啊
You look like a beautiful couple.

273
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,200
我的專輯剛發行
Yo, my album just dropped,

274
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,730
你喜歡說唱  嘻哈嗎
You like rap, hip-hop?

275
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,600
我這歌可有深度了  歌詞又好聽
Yo, this shit is deep, lyrical, poetic.

276
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,390
你女友肯定喜歡  肯定的
Yo, your girl will like this, my man, I swear.

277
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:12,510
老兄  你在我們大樓外邊都轉悠了半個月了
Come on, bro, you've been outside our building for two weeks now.

278
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:14,230
那好吧  我買了
All right, you know, I'll take it,

279
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,560
你能別纏著我們嗎
if you leave us alone.

280
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,390
謝謝您  太謝謝你了大哥
Thank you, thank you, man, thank you.

281
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:19,720
而且我聽著順耳才會發推  明白嗎
And I'll tweet, but only if I like it, all right?

282
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,540
我只有48個粉  不過還在穩步增長
I only have 48 followers, but it's growing.

283
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,900
-當然當然  -其中有人品味很好
- No doubt, no doubt. - Some tastemakers in there so--

284
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,330
我懂  我懂
I feel you, I feel you.

285
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,130
-行  -那好
- Yeah. - All right.

286
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:26,860
太謝謝你了  真的
Yo, I appreciate it, man, really.

287
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:27,940
-祝你們一天順順當當的  -你也是
- You guys have a good day. - Yeah, you too.

288
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,630
多謝你們  聽聽第二首
Thank you so much. Check track two out.

289
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,500
-第二首  -回見哥們
- Track two. - All right, man.

290
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,010
這可是計劃外狀況
This was never part of the plan.

291
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:36,210
公布數據  還要釋放泰瑞·科比
Data dumps? Releasing Terry Colby?

292
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:37,830
根本說不通
None of this makes sense.

293
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,520
我得和去社會撇清關系
Need to cut off all ties with fsociety.

294
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,190
再不和他們聯系
Need to disconnect.

295
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,210
我得請個病假  暫時低調...
We need to call in sick and lie low for a--

296
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,820
有病啊你  我光著呢  混蛋
Dude! Jesus Christ! I am naked, asshole!

297
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,680
瞅什么瞅
Don't stare at me!

298
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:06,480
你怎么在我家洗澡
Why the hell are you in my shower?

299
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,470
我本來在等你
Well, I was waiting for you.

300
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:09,720
你昨晚該來的
You were supposed to come last night.

301
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,300
-你忘了  -來  來哪里
- Did you forget? - Come? Where?

302
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,500
無所謂了  大家待會兒會去
It's fine, everyone's coming later.

303
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:22,730
我順你幾件衣服穿
I'm stealing your clothes.

304
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:25,450
有人射在我的衣服上了
My dress has cum stains on it.

305
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:31,290
天啊  我逗你玩呢
Jesus, I am just messing with you.

306
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:32,560
我的衣服在洗衣機里
My stuff is just in the wash.

307
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,400
洗好之前先穿一會兒你的衣服
I'm gonna borrow this for the time being.

308
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,290
對了
Oh, by the way,

309
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,430
你的狗在你床上拉屎了
your dog shat on your bed.

310
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,830
狗是得出去溜的
You gotta walk that thing.

311
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,770
麻煩你幫我照看小鰭一下吧
Hey, please take Flipper for a while.

312
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:48,400
她可能得帶出去溜溜
She probably needs a walk or something.

313
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,120
到處拉屎
She keeps shitting everywhere.

314
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,290
當然得溜啊  艾略特
Of course she needs a walk, Elliot.

315
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:52,530
她是條狗
She's a friggin' dog.

316
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:55,520
我們出發之前我想吃點兒酸奶
Yo, I want to stop and get some froyo before we go.

317
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:00,080
我待會兒就回
Uh, I'll be back later.

318
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,740
-我欠你個人情  -大人情
- I owe you. - Yeah, big time.

319
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:17,090
你怎么知道我住哪
How do you know where I live?

320
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:19,140
我怎么就不能知道你住哪
Why wouldn't I know where you live?

321
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,210
不知道  我就不知道你住哪
I don't know. I don't know where you live.

322
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,250
我目前也沒個固定住處
I don't live anywhere at the present.

323
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:34,490
我約會的那傻子跟我求婚了  你相信嗎
The douche I was dating proposed to me, can you believe?

324
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:36,720
整個一混蛋嘛
I mean, what an asshole.

325
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,750
總之我們大吵了一架  然后
Anyways, we got into this huge fight, and--

326
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:41,900
我在磨蹭什么呢
What the hell am I doing?

327
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,530
這個妞兒完全就是個瘋子
This chick is out of her mind batshit crazy.

328
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:46,540
我得趕緊回去  把一切都告訴吉迪恩
I gotta go back, tell Gideon everything.

329
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,860
他會理解的  對吧
He'll understand, right?

330
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,250
他會知道怎么辦的
He'll know what to do.

331
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,710
沒關系的  他會來找我的
It's whatevs. He'll take me back.

332
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:52,990
他得趁早戒了那一套
He's just gotta get over this whole

333
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:55,340
"愛你到永遠"之類的屁話
"Love is forever" bullshit.

334
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,730
我先躲一陣
I'll do my disappearing act for a minute,

335
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:59,720
然后他就會想通了
and then he'll come to his senses.

336
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,940
-車門關閉  注意安全  -我們就這樣
- Stand clear of the closing door. - You know, it's our thing.

337
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,260
快點
Quick!

338
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:16,330
她也能看到他們嗎
Can she see them, too?

339
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:17,450
怎么了
What?

340
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:19,400
我喜歡臨時起意
I like to stay on my toes.

341
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:25,550
說到那個  那簡直煩人死了...
Speaking of, that's, like, one of the most annoying things--

342
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:28,110
但如果提利爾發現了  他會怎么做
But what if Tyrell finds out? What will he do?

343
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:31,580
倒霉  除了被殺和坐牢
Shit, there's basically no scenario in which

344
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,610
基本上沒別的可能
I'm not getting killed or going to jail.

345
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:38,020
我想要只海龜  他就不讓
Because I wanted a turtle, and he was like, "No--"

346
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:40,210
我大概要跟你待兩晚
I might need to crash with you for a couple of nights.

347
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:41,730
沒事吧
That's cool, right?

348
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:43,880
不是吧
Seriously?

349
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:46,560
好吧  那我去莫布利家
Fine! I'll crash at Mobley's.

350
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:48,710
反正我也不喜歡狗
Don't love dogs anyway.

351
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:50,710
特別是你在你床上拉屎的
Especially ones that shit in your bed.

352
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:52,600
你那樣怎么住得下去
I mean, how do you live like that, honestly?

353
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,660
你怎么睡得著...
How do you go to sleep when you know that there's...

354
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,270
目前看來
For all we know,

355
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:57,580
我可能正步入一個圈套
I could be walking into a trap right now.

356
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,920
一旦走進那扇門  我們可能就會沒命
We could be dead the second I walk through that door.

357
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:03,610
快跟上  小子  有大事等著我們
Come on, kid. We got big things in store.

358
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,980
大事
Big things.

359
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,620
風云人物  行個屈膝禮吧
Man of the hour. Take a curtsy.

360
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,920
臭鴨子
Goddamn ducks.

361
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,850
哥們
Hey, hey, man!

362
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:29,040
那個...倒霉  抱歉  伙計
What's... Oh. Shit, sorry, sorry, dude.

363
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,300
好吧
Um, okay.

364
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:33,090
總之  干得漂亮  兄弟
Anyway, just, awesome work, man.

365
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:34,010
超棒
Really awesome.

366
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:35,380
厲害  哥們  厲害
Right on, man. Right on.

367
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:36,710
-超厲害  -好啦
- Real cool. - Great.

368
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:39,400
我們已經相互拍了馬屁
So now that we're all done going down on each other,

369
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:41,660
能了解一下計劃嗎
can we please hear the plan?

370
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,340
鋼山那邊現在進展如何
Where are we at with Steel Mountain?

371
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,660
如果沒弄錯
If I'm not mistaken,

372
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,350
那些線路還不是百分百安全
these lines aren't 100% safe yet,

373
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:48,310
我們還沒能讓科比項目消失
and we still haven't made the Colby project disappear.

374
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,230
不是吧
Seriously?

375
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:51,420
都過去幾周了  有任何連接或線索
It's been weeks. Any links or traces

376
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:52,720
現在早該被掌握了
would have been owned by now.

377
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,210
線路上無跡可尋  老大  我發誓
The lines are clean, Boss, I swear.

378
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,640
-謝謝  -我想...
- Thank you. - I mean, um...

379
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,790
如果能讓你安心點  羅梅洛和我可以檢查...
if it makes you feel better, Romero and I can check...

380
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,010
很好  這我就安心多了
Great! Make me feel great.

381
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:04,840
我去那邊待著  整理一下思路
I'm gonna hang back over here, collect my thoughts.

382
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:16,090
她怎么回事
What's her deal?

383
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,080
這女人很難懂
Ah, she's a complicated woman.

384
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,980
大多寫惡意軟件的碼農都這樣  對吧
Most malware coders are. Am I right?

385
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,030
她跑去了我公寓
She showed up at my apartment.

386
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:24,230
她怎么知道我住哪
Why does she know where I live?

387
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:25,250
別管她了
Let's not focus on her.

388
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,930
否則會像嗑嗨醒不過來一樣
That'll be like entering a bad K-hole you'll never wake up from.

389
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:30,590
你該關注我們項目的下一階段
Instead, I need you to focus on the next phase of our project.

390
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:33,120
彗星  奧爾巴尼的那個天然氣工廠  知道嗎
Comet, the natural gas plant up around Albany?

391
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:37,900
我們打算把它炸了
We're gonna blow it up.

392
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,580
為什么要炸...
Why would you blow...

393
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:44,160
彗星工廠就在鋼山旁邊
Comet plant's right next to Steel Mountain.

394
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,780
如你所知
Which, as you know,

395
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,590
是標準普爾所有公司
is the off-site and data storage facility

396
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,400
外部數據存儲中心
for every corporation in the S&P,

397
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,460
包括大家的最愛
including everyone's favorite--

398
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,350
-邪惡公司  -沒錯
- Evil Corp. - Bingo!

399
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,520
你打算破壞他們的磁帶備份
You're gonna destroy their tape backups.

400
00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:59,130
他們肯定在提防這種事
They're gonna be looking out for something like that.

401
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,760
被黑后就變得高度警覺了
They've been on high alert ever since the hack.

402
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,210
據說已經抓到那個黑客了
From what I heard, they've caught their hacker.

403
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:05,530
-不是嗎  -沒有
- Haven't they? - No, they haven't.

404
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:08,210
-提利爾·威利克知道了  -只知道想讓他知道的
- Tyrell Wellick knows. - What they want him to know!

405
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:10,350
他和其他人一樣不過是公司機器人
He's a corporate robot just like the rest of them.

406
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:12,530
而且整個公司都要
Besides, the entire company is gonna be reeling

407
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:14,400
應付我們準備的數據公布了
from all the data dumps we've got in store for them--

408
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,180
我們有不少好東西呢
and man, do we have some goodies.

409
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,890
老式高管種族歧視
Some good old-fashioned executive racism,

410
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:19,770
性別歧視  法西斯主義
sexism, Fascism.

411
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:22,200
相信我  我們會拿各種麻煩淹沒他們
Trust me, we are gonna "ism" so much all over them

412
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,690
讓他們暈頭轉向
they won't be able to see straight.

413
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:25,910
要求釋放科比這點很聰明
And asking for Colby's release as ransom was genius.

414
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:27,550
這只會讓他更受關注
That'll only make his spotlight bigger,

415
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:29,000
我們不會被發現
keeping it off us.

416
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,340
那個小花招是特倫頓的主意
That neat little ditty was Trenton's idea.

417
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:34,200
她看起來無害  但可別小瞧她
She may look innocent, but I'd be careful.

418
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:36,450
她的神力不小呢
She's got some Allah Akbar in her.

419
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,740
我們搞這些的同時
And while all that's going on,

420
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:41,200
你要用你的眾安安全權限
you will use your Allsafe security clearance

421
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,650
黑進彗星的壓力控制  增加壓強
to hack the Comet PLC, increase the pressure,

422
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:45,430
造成天然氣管道爆炸
causing a gas pipeline explosion

423
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:49,180
讓鋼山和邪惡公司的數據一起炸飛
making Steel Mountain go kablooey along with Evil Corp's soul.

424
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,960
他們都知道這個
They know about all this?

425
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,020
你是第一個
You're the first.

426
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,650
那些工人
Workers?

427
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:05,160
住在工廠附近的居民
Anyone living around the plant...

428
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:06,730
他們都會死
They all die?

429
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:08,360
我們會讓他們先跑
We'll give them a head start.

430
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,120
鳴響警報之類的  他們會沒事
Sound some alarms. They'll be fine.

431
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,430
你要炸一根天然氣管道
You're blowing up a gas pipeline.

432
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:17,750
這個世界本來就很危險  艾略特
The world is a dangerous place, Elliot,

433
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:19,260
不是因為干壞事的人
not because of those who do evil,

434
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:21,890
而是因為那些圍觀無作為的人
but because of those who look on and do nothing.

435
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:22,950
這是戰爭
This is war.

436
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,940
會死人的  死亡難以避免
People will die. C'est la mort.

437
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,410
等我們炸了管線
And once we blow up the pipeline,

438
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:30,860
達琳的蠕蟲會在美國數據中心
Darlene's worm will kick into high gear

439
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:31,900
開始加速運轉
at the U.S. Data center

440
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,530
這還是你幫忙裝的  多謝了
which you helped to us install, thank you very much.

441
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:38,720
遠在中國的東方數據中心的冗余備份
The redundant backups at their eastern data center in China--

442
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:41,640
有黑暗軍團幫我們
the Dark Army is covering us on that.

443
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:44,590
黑暗軍團  為什么啊
Dark Army? Why, man?

444
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:46,570
他們毫無準則  為任何人做雇傭黑客
They got no code. They hack for anyone:

445
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:48,370
恐怖分子  北朝  伊朗  俄國
terrorists, North Korea, Iran, Russia--

446
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:51,600
所以說他們也痛恨美國資本主義
Which means they hate U.S. capitalism just as much as anyone.

447
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,660
還有一點
Last but not least.

448
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,130
鋼山
Steel Mountain.

449
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:00,280
黑客困境
The hacker's dilemma. 

450
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:03,370
你如何摧毀完全
What to do when a bunch of data you want to destroy

451
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:05,170
不聯網的數據
is completely off the grid?

452
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,820
我不會殺人的
I'm not killing anyone.

453
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:17,320
告訴我  艾略特
Tell me one thing, Elliot.

454
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:20,080
你是1還是0
Are you a one or a zero?

455
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:23,310
你要問自己這個問題
That's the question you have to ask yourself.

456
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:25,140
你是是還是否
Are you a yes or a no?

457
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,580
你是要采取行動  還是無所作為
Are you going to act or not?

458
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:34,250
你是玩電腦
Yo...you've been staring at a computer screen

459
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,180
玩太久了  朋友
way too long, homie.

460
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:38,140
生活不是那么二進制的
Life's not that binary.

461
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,370
是嗎
Isn't it?

462
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:41,980
是啊  有灰色地帶
Sure, there are grays--

463
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:44,410
但說到底  最根本
but when you come right down to it, at its core,

464
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:48,190
每個決定  都是由1或0構成
beneath every choice, there's either a one or a zero.

465
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,950
你要么采取行動  要么什么不做
You either do something or you don't.

466
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:54,100
你走出那扇門  就是決定了要什么都不做
You walk out that door, you've decided to do nothing,

467
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:57,450
決定拒絕  那么你就不能再回來了
to say no, which means you do not come back.

468
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:00,980
你走  就不再是這事的一員了
You leave, you are no longer a part of this.

469
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,550
你就是0了
You become a zero.

470
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,740
如果你留下
If you stay,

471
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,440
如果你想改變世界
if you want to change the world,

472
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:10,810
你就選擇了同意
you become a yes.

473
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:13,050
你就是1
You become a one.

474
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:15,580
我再問你一次
So, I'll ask you again:

475
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:19,180
你是1還是0
are you a one or a zero?

476
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:21,410
我做的事導致一個無辜者入獄
An innocent man is in prison because of what I did.

477
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:23,250
得了  別自欺欺人了
Come on, let's not kid ourselves!

478
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,170
這跟科比毫無關系
This has nothing to do with Colby.

479
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,730
甚至跟我的革命都無關
This isn't even about my revolution.

480
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,310
對你不僅是如此
This is more than that for you.

481
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:37,310
你是為了那些混蛋慢慢地殺了你父親
This is about how those bastards slowly killed your father

482
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:39,020
而你希望他當初對此采取了行動
and how you wished he'd done something about it.

483
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:41,910
但他沒有  因為他是0
But he didn't. Because he was a zero,

484
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:44,030
就像你現在這樣
just like you're being right now.

485
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,560
去你的
F--- you.

486
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,080
又要玩消失嗎
Disappearing again?

487
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:59,760
我不殺人  你們別扯上我
I'm not killing anyone. Leave me out of this.

488
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:03,750
這事你躲不過
You don't get to disappear from this.

489
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,260
有沒有你我們都會做
We can do it with or without you,

490
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:07,150
但你無論如何都已經參與了
but you're a part of it either way!

491
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:10,870
就算你的傻逼兜帽也保護不了你  賤人
Yeah, even your stupid hoodie can't protect you, bitch!

492
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:12,090
這就是個錯誤
This was a mistake.

493
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:14,050
我得告發他們  我該告發他們嗎
I've gotta turn them in. Should I turn them in?

494
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:16,380
我會惹上麻煩嗎  該死  她說得有理
Will I get into trouble? Shit, she's right.

495
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:19,010
我現在也有罪了  不  是我們有罪
I'm culpable now. No, we're culpable.

496
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:22,550
你跟我是一起的了  趕緊想辦法吧
You're in this with me, so start thinking of solutions now.

497
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:28,460
夏拉
Shayla?

498
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:35,730
夏拉
Yo, Shayla.

499
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,190
伙計
Yo, bro.

500
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:39,890
需要什么嗎
Can I help you with something?

501
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:46,500
我就是想跟夏拉談談
I, uh...just need to talk to Shayla.

502
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,050
你女人啊
Oh, your girl.

503
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:49,940
她在浴缸里呢
She in the tub.

504
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,450
夏拉
Shayla.

505
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:58,460
她待會兒就出來了
Yo, she'll be out in a minute.

506
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,320
你想的話坐下等會兒吧
Can sit and wait if you want.

507
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:06,930
我們還是進去看看吧  確保她沒事
I think we should check on her, make sure she's all right.

508
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:11,950
你真逗  我喜歡你
You a funny dude. I like you.

509
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,460
別那么沒禮貌
Don't be rude.

510
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:17,250
坐下  待會兒
Sit down and chill.

511
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,360
不用了
No, that's right.

512
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,890
你只嗑這個
You only do this.

513
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:46,780
就認識你一個一邊嗑藥一邊用戒癮藥的
Only nigga I know that take withdrawal meds while he using.

514
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:48,660
很聰明
That's smart.

515
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,270
是不是還騙自己說你不是個癮君子
Probably even convinced yourself you ain't an addict.

516
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,020
該死
Oh, shit.

517
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:57,690
都忘記自我介紹了  我是費南...
Forgot to introduce myself. I'm Fernan--

518
00:27:57,690 --> 00:27:59,430
費南多·維拉  夏拉的毒販
Fernando Vera, Shayla's supplier.

519
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:01,350
我黑過的最渣的人之一
One of the worst human beings I've ever hacked.

520
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:05,250
他的密碼  吃屌6969[體位]
His password? "Eatadick6969."

521
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:08,840
不僅在色情片和網絡攝像頭上花了很多錢
Aside from the massive amounts of money he spends on porn and webcams,

522
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:12,650
他的毒品交易還都是通過電郵  網聊和推特做的
he does all his drug transactions through emails, IMs, Twitter.

523
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,520
警方居然還沒逮到他  簡直難以理解
The fact that the cops haven't caught him yet is beyond me.

524
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,780
如果他們有點腦子
If they had half a brain cell,

525
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:19,510
早就該能破解他們團伙超級簡單的密文
they'd be able to crack his gang's simplistic code,

526
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:21,250
如果那算得上密文的話
if it can even be called that.

527
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,940
花了幾小時理清他發布的推文
After only a couple of hours of timing his tweets

528
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,380
和相關新聞報道的時間線
with related news articles,

529
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,240
我便搞明白"餅干"和"咔嗒"
I figured out that "biscuit" and "clickety"

530
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,150
顯然是指槍
clearly referenced guns.

531
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:31,940
"食物""貝殼"或"汽油"是子彈
"Food," "sea shells" or "gas" for bullets.

532
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:34,890
還有最狠的  "早早哄入睡"
And the ultimate: "Rock to sleep early."

533
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:37,240
我還沒直接與那起命案聯系起來
I haven't made the direct connection to a hit yet,

534
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,970
但槍支加上子彈
but the math of guns plus bullets

535
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:40,930
一般只有一種結果
usually adds up to one thing.

536
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,770
我考慮過告發他
I've thought about turning him in,

537
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:44,740
但他是夏拉唯一的供毒販
but he's Shayla's only supplier.

538
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,040
我扳倒他  我也沒藥了
I take him down, I lose my drugs,

539
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:50,300
現在有那么多事  我不能失去藥
and with everything going on right now, I can't have that.

540
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,850
你懂的吧
You get that, though?

541
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:54,950
總之  伙計
Anyway, bro,

542
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:57,120
不用擔心我
I ain't nothing to worry about.

543
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,100
就是來給你送貨的
Just making a drop for you.

544
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:03,310
你叫什么
What's your name, anyway?

545
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,720
艾略特
Elliot.

546
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,460
什么意思
What it mean?

547
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,190
你從沒谷歌過嗎
What, you ain't never Googled it?

548
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:13,030
得去谷歌啊
Man, you gotta do that.

549
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:15,540
一個人名字的含義是很重要的  伙計
The meaning of a person's name is important, bro.

550
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,260
她沒事的  她沒事
Yo, she good! She good.

551
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:24,000
相信我
Trust me.

552
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:26,530
我親自確保的
Took care of that shit myself.

553
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:34,300
你讓我想起了我年輕一點的時候
You remind me of me when I was younger,

554
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:36,110
壓抑  陰沉
depressed and sullen.

555
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:39,230
事實上  我還曾幾次試圖自殺
Matter of fact, tried to kill myself, a couple of times.

556
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,410
一直沒做對
Never could get that shit right.

557
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,160
生物不是我的強項
Biology wasn't my strong suit.

558
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:49,150
我恨自己  現在也是
I hated myself, man. Still do.

559
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:52,230
很久以來  覺得那是軟弱
Thought that shit was a weakness for a long time.

560
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:01,050
然后我意識到  那是我的力量
Then I realized that shit was my power.

561
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:05,410
這世上的人  一副知道恨是什么的樣子
People walk around, act like they know what hate means.

562
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:09,970
不  沒人知道  除非你恨自己
Nah, no one does, until you hate yourself.

563
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:11,120
我是指
I mean...

564
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:14,080
真正恨自己
truly hate yourself.

565
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:17,230
那才是力量
That's power.

566
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:31,090
你不怕我吧
You ain't scared of me, are you?

567
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,170
很好
That's good.

568
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,590
那我就不用浪費時間討好你了
Means I didn't waste my time making friends with you.

569
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,840
你并不需要這個吧
You don't really need these, do you?

570
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,090
你這么勇敢的人  能撐過戒癮的
Man of your courage can last through a little withdrawal.

571
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:52,660
就是因為你  我才認識夏拉
Ya know, you the only reason why I met Shayla.

572
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,420
我是市內唯一什么都賣的人
I'm the only nigga in town carrying everything,

573
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,990
包括你的寶貝賽寶松
including your precious Suboxone.

574
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:02,770
所以  說來怪  但我該感謝你
So, in a weird way, I should be thanking you.

575
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,360
是你把她送到我身邊
You brought her to me.

576
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:07,480
你的行星環繞我
Your star orbiting with mine, gravitationally,

577
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:10,810
給我帶來了我的摯愛  艾略特
brought me the love of my life, Elliot.

578
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:13,070
我們這樣
I mean, this, us?

579
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,240
在這里相見
Being here?

580
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,900
這擁有
This has...

581
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,640
美妙的意義
beautiful meaning.

582
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:22,120
但別誤會  那女孩
But make no mistake, that girl in there...

583
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,540
是我的
is mine.

584
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,510
離了她我都不知道如何是好
I don't know what I'd do without her.

585
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,860
我不知道你們之前
Now, I don't know what kind of arrangement

586
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:34,750
有怎樣的安排  但既然我們都是朋友了
you had with her before, but now that we friends...

587
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:38,500
相信你會知道朋友妻不可欺
I trust you respect this boundary.

588
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:40,610
懂嗎
Feel me?

589
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:53,860
今天早些時候也有個家伙這么看我
A dude earlier today gave me that same look.

590
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:56,070
我只想說
Only thing I gotta say is,

591
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,540
有時候  還是害怕明智  伙計
there's a smart time to be scared, bro...

592
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:02,260
也有時不明智
and a stupid time.

593
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,090
夏拉
Shayla?

594
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:10,820
撬鎖
The lock pick.

595
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,620
所有黑客最鐘情的運動
Every hacker's favorite sport.

596
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,020
最合適去破解的系統
The perfect system to crack,

597
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:16,090
主要是因為與虛擬系統不同
mostly because unlike virtual systems,

598
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:17,940
你撬開它時  你能感覺到
when you break it, you can feel it.

599
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,840
能看到  能聽到
You can see it. You can hear it.

600
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,290
夏拉
Shayla.

601
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:34,050
醒醒
Wake up.

602
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,880
怎么回事
What happened?

603
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:42,260
你沒事吧
You okay?

604
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,970
那混蛋怎么在這兒
Why was that asshole here?

605
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,000
我怎么在浴缸里
Why am I in the tub?

606
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:56,120
我不知道  我告訴他  我需要你的藥
I don't know, um...I told him I needed your pills.

607
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,160
他就過來  我們抽了一會兒
He came over. We smoked a little.

608
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,250
你記得跟他做愛嗎
You remember having sex with him?

609
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:05,080
什么  不
What? No.

610
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:07,300
但他肯定記得
But he definitely does.

611
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,340
好吧  走吧
Okay, let's go.

612
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,540
-拿上你的包  一定...  -別說了
- Get your purse, make sure-- - Stop.

613
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:12,790
我哪也不去
I'm not going anywhere, okay?

614
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:15,420
什么意思
What do you mean?

615
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,330
你要讓他逃脫罪責嗎
Oh, he's just gonna get away with it?

616
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,840
你不能再去找他了  我不需要那些藥
You can't go back to him. Hey, I don't need the pills.

617
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,720
-找別人試試吧  -我不能
- Just find someone else. - I can't.

618
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:31,150
他給我的價錢很便宜
He gives me a really good deal on the split.

619
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,360
我掙錢多
I make good money.

620
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:35,550
又來了
There it is again,

621
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:38,060
那個隱形之手在控制我們
the invisible hand at work, controlling us,

622
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:40,850
即使推我們越過了疼痛臨界點
even if it pushes us past our threshold of pain.

623
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,490
這不會停止的
It's not gonna stop.

624
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,650
如果他再這么做呢
What if he does it again?

625
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:48,090
答應我你不會做任何事
Promise me you won't do anything?

626
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,480
我說真的  艾略特
I'm serious, Elliot.

627
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,580
沒什么可做的
There's nothing to be done here.

628
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:56,870
我又沒什么選擇
It's not like I have a choice.

629
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,500
你今晚能睡這里嗎
Would you mind sleeping here tonight?

630
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:08,990
選擇
Choices.

631
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:11,650
或許機器人先生是對的
Maybe Mr. Robot's right.

632
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:15,790
這才是一切的關鍵  生活中的同意和拒絕
That's what this is all about, the yesses and nos of life.

633
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:19,110
但是我們做決定  還是決定左右我們
But do we decide them or do they decide us?

634
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,950
費南多·維拉  我解決了他
Fernando Vera. I get rid of him,

635
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:24,230
也就斷了我自己的毒品源
I get rid of my drug dealer's supplier.

636
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:25,810
也就斷了嗎啡
I get rid of the morphine.

637
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:28,400
我一直在控制的痛苦會一擁而上
And the pain I've been holding in comes rushing out.

638
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,200
是啊  我可以再去找其他毒販
Sure, I can try to find another dealer,

639
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,230
但就像維拉所說  街面上沒人賣賽寶松
but like Vera said, no one on the streets deals Suboxone.

640
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:36,820
我可以回到電子偽造處方的手段
I could go back to digitally counterfeiting scripts,

641
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:39,620
但藥房都花大錢保護他們的商品
but pharmas spend a lot of dough protecting their wares.

642
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:41,990
大部分地方只收紙質處方
Most places only take paper scripts.

643
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,800
想一直拿到合法的處方是不現實的
Continuously getting legit refills isn't realistic,

644
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,490
做癮君子也一樣
and neither is being a junkie.

645
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,830
所以  我要么直接戒斷  要么就放過維拉
So I quit cold turkey or let Vera exist.

646
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,750
我知道你在想什么  答案太簡單了
I know what you're thinking. The answer's too obvious.

647
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,100
維拉之前或許已經對夏拉動手動腳
Vera may have been groping Shayla before,

648
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:57,640
但現在他已經升級至強奸了
but he's graduated to rape.

649
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:01,030
{\an8}費南多·維拉  早早哄入睡

650
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:04,530
跟夏拉一樣  他讓我別無選擇
Just like Shayla, he's left me no choice.

651
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:07,470
不能允許他再逍遙了
He can't be allowed to exist anymore.

652
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,450
我們先說說你的感受吧
Perhaps we should start with how you're feeling.

653
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,880
不太好
Not good.

654
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,100
現在什么不太好
What's not good right now?

655
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:35,560
都不好
Everything.

656
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:39,880
跟我說說細節吧
Humor me with some specifics.

657
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:48,380
你要如何知道你能掌控生活
How do we know if we're in control?

658
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:54,060
而不是對生活的困難
That we're not just making the best

659
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:56,300
盡力而為  僅此而已
of what comes at us, and that's it.

660
00:35:57,030 --> 00:36:00,520
總是在兩個選項中二選其一
Trying to constantly pick between two options.

661
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:03,340
就像你等候室里的兩幅畫
Like your two paintings in the waiting room.

662
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:08,520
或是  可樂還是百事
Or...Coke and Pepsi.

663
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,830
麥當勞還是漢堡王
McDonald's or Burger King?

664
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,680
現代還是本田
Hyundai or Honda?

665
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:20,770
{\an8}費南多·維拉

666
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,640
都是模糊一片  不是嗎
It's all part of the same blur, right?

667
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:27,640
{\an8}唐人街暴力沖突升級  黑幫分子被殺

668
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,970
剛好對不上焦
Just out of focus enough.

669
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,320
{\an8}紐約警局匿名檢舉熱線

670
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,100
只是有選擇的幻覺
It's the illusion of choice.

671
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,640
{\an8}維拉

672
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:33,980
我們半數人  甚至不能自己選
Half of us can't even pick our own--

673
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,700

675
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,210
{\an8}多謝你協助保護紐約市安全

676
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:41,240
我們喝的水  我們的醫療保險
The water we drink, our health insurance.

677
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,630
就算是我們選的  又有什么用
Even if we did, would it matter?

678
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:48,400
如果我們只能在藍十字會和藍盾[均為醫療保險]中選擇
You know, if our only option is Blue Cross or Blue Shield,

679
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:50,820
那又有什么差別
what the f--- is the difference?

680
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:58,270
而且  這倆不是一樣的嗎
In fact, aren't they-- aren't they the same?

681
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,080
不
No, man...

682
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:06,220
我們的選擇早已經有定數了
our choices are prepaid for us,

683
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:08,160
早就選好了
long time ago.

684
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:12,860
很遺憾你感到無法控制
I'm sorry you feel you have no control.

685
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:17,990
我以為我在做好事
Thought I was doing something good.

686
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:24,160
我參與了一個項目
I was a part of this... project.

687
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:28,830
我以為我參與了一件特別的事
Thought I was going to be a part of something special.

688
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:34,680
現在呢
And now?

689
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:36,610
現在
Now...

690
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:40,430
原來那是個錯誤
It turned out to be a mistake,

691
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:42,610
就像其他的一切
like everything else.

692
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:46,100
有什么意義
What's the point, right?

693
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:50,720
真不如  什么都不做
Might as well, just-- you do nothing.

694
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:53,350
不如什么都不做
Might as well do nothing.

695
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,190
你以前也提過這個問題
You've brought up this issue before,

696
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:00,560
感覺你無法控制
this issue of not feeling like you're in control.

697
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,610
記得嗎
Do you remember?

698
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:06,960
那是我們聊你父親的時候
When we spoke about your father.

699
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:10,550
你說他抗擊癌癥時
You talked about how he chose to do nothing

700
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:12,500
選擇了無所作為
when he was battling his cancer.

701
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:16,540
你跟他說  他可以起訴導致他得癌的公司
You told him he could have fought the company that caused it.

702
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:18,510
他可以把這事說出去
He could have told people about it.

703
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,070
他可以尋求更好的治療
He could have sought better care than what he was getting.

704
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,530
但他什么都沒做
Instead, he did nothing.

705
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:29,770
或許你父親當時的感覺跟你現在一樣
Maybe your father felt the same way as you do now.

706
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:33,870
畢竟  就像你說的  有什么意義呢
After all, like you said, what's the point?

707
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,630
-這不一樣  -不一樣的是
- It's different. - What's different

708
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:39,110
你找到了選擇  艾略特
is you've found options, Elliot.

709
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:42,510
這是你擁有的權力  你擁有的控制權
That's the power you have. That's the control you own.

710
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:45,380
你不想單純接受生活的安排
You don't have to just take what life gives you.

711
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,000
說吧
Come on.

712
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:51,440
告訴我你究竟是怎么了
Tell me what is going on with you.

713
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,070
你不告訴我  我沒法幫你
I cannot help you if you keep me in the dark.

714
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:55,100
別說了
Shut up!

715
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:00,080
別說了
Shut up!

716
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:04,790
你有黑眼圈
You've got bags under your eyes.

717
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:06,780
你在大喊  你煩躁不安
You're yelling. You're jittery.

718
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,820
這幾個月來  我看著你
For the last month, I have seen you

719
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:11,750
漸漸回歸老路子  以前的行為
slip into old patterns, old behaviors.

720
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:17,010
到底怎么樣了
What is going on?

721
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:25,870
{\an8}刻錄  費南多·維拉

722
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,300
{\an8}刪除

723
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:58,760
{\an8}工業氣候控制白皮書

724
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:01,790
{\an8}室內溫度控制

725
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,880
他還是不接
He's still not answering.

726
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:21,620
那我們明天問他吧
Well, we'll just have to ask him tomorrow.

727
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:24,380
我每次播放這東西
Every time I try to play it or rip it,

728
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:27,900
就只是卡住我的電腦  然后再彈出
it just freezes up my computer and spits it back out again.

729
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:30,290
他不太好
He's not okay.

730
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:33,130
他今天在公司根本心不在焉
He was acting so out of it at work today.

731
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,660
{\an8}斯黛拉·B  你得馬上看看

732
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:40,490
{\an8} 今晚過來吧

733
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:48,200
{\an8}我盡量  待會兒打給你

734
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:46,230
你說什么
Are you saying something, babe?

735
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,470
他不對勁
Something's wrong.

736
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:49,440
我該過去看看嗎
Should I go over there?

737
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,450
就是去
And just...

738
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:53,270
看看他
Check in on him?

739
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:56,420
得了
Uh...come on.

740
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:58,220
別傻了
That's ridiculous.

741
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,920
你知道他一直都是個怪人
You know he's always been a weirdo, right?

742
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,680
我真心擔心他
I'm really worried about him.

743
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:10,110
我亞利桑那州的朋友弗萊德找到了我
My Arizona buddy Fred hit me up.

744
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:12,600
他想跟我喝一杯
He wants to grab a drink.

745
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,780
不會太久的
Shouldn't take too long.

746
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:17,790
好
Okay.

747
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:03,210
{\an8}進去了

748
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:33,120
"深深的激情和渴望...
"Deep passions, longing...

749
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:35,540
他們兩人從未感受到過這般的愛
the two of them had never felt such a love,

750
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,800
如此親昵  如此心有靈犀"
such closeness, such a connection."

751
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,040
我有辦法不用...
Found a way to do it without--

752
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:44,420
坐
Sit down.

753
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:56,510
我知道要如何摧毀備份
I know how to take out the backups

754
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:58,040
而不必炸管線了
without blowing up the pipeline.

755
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,980
艾略特  這事我們不是
You know, Elliot, I really feel like we resolved

756
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:02,550
已經解決了嗎  你不是退出了嗎
this thing between us. Didn't you walk away?

757
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:03,730
是啊
I did. 

758
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:05,430
我不是說  你如果走掉
Didn't I say that if you walked away,

759
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:06,900
你就不再是這件事的一員了
you were no longer a part of this?

760
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,260
我想好了一個計劃
I have a real plan--

761
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:12,320
如果你想要我再允許你加入
If you want me to let you back in,

762
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,270
我們得達成一定共識
there's an understanding we have to come to,

763
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,240
你得還個債
a debt you have to pay,

764
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,230
別忘了  是你退出了
because, remember, you walked away.

765
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:19,810
你不是不信債務這回事嗎
I thought you didn't believe in debts.

766
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:22,270
不是的  我相信債務
Not true. I believe in debts.

767
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,810
我相信該消除債務
I believe in erasing them.

768
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:29,550
你想怎么樣
What do you want?

769
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:35,310
我要你跟我說說你父親
I want you to tell me about your father.

770
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:38,640
你別想探究我的心理
You're not gonna get into my head, man.

771
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,740
少給我洗腦
Your David Koresh shit isn't gonna work on me.

772
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:42,070
跟我說說他是怎么死的
Tell me how he died.

773
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,670
有什么意義  我覺得
Why, man? Something tells me

774
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:46,440
你已經查過了
you already looked that shit up anyway.

775
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:47,680
我想聽你說
I wanna hear it from you.

776
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:56,680
我告訴你
So I do this...

777
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:59,090
我們就能回游戲廳
we go back to the arcade,

778
00:43:59,090 --> 00:44:00,930
跟其他人探討這個計劃嗎
discuss the plan with the rest of them?

779
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:17,260
我不知道你指望我說什么
I don't know what you want me to say.

780
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:20,600
我們本來很親近  非常親近
We were close. Very close.

781
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,900
他是我最好的朋友
He was my best friend.

782
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:25,070
一輩子都在邪惡公司工作
Worked at Evil Corp his whole life.

783
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,930
本來是他們最棒的電腦工程師
He was one of the best computer engineers they had.

784
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:31,890
突然就被解雇了
And out of the blue, he got fired.

785
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:32,980
沒人知道原因
No one knew why.

786
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:35,670
然后有一天  他告訴我
Then one day he told me.

787
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:38,630
他得了白血病
He had leukemia.

788
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:41,750
還逼我不可以告訴別人
Made me swear to never tell anyone,

789
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:43,200
尤其是我媽
especially my mom.

790
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:45,570
我就沒說
So I didn't.

791
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:47,760
幾個月后
A few months go by...

792
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,030
他病得越來越重
he got sicker and sicker.

793
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:52,920
最后  我太擔心了
Finally, I got so worried...

794
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:56,170
就告訴了我媽
told my mom.

795
00:44:57,370 --> 00:44:59,880
他知道后  大為光火
When he found out, he got pissed.

796
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:01,680
對我大吼大叫
Started yelling.

797
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:06,040
我記得我想去抱他  跟他道歉
I remember I tried to hug him, tell him I'm sorry, and...

798
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,350
他卻把我狠狠推開
kept shoving me away and shoved me so hard

799
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:11,610
結果我跌出了窗外
I fell backwards out the window.

800
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,520
把胳膊摔折了
I fell, and I broke my arm.

801
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,560
他此后再也沒跟我說過話
Never spoke to me after that.

802
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:19,100
甚至不肯看我
Couldn't even look at me.

803
00:45:19,930 --> 00:45:21,240
甚至是他死的那晚
Even the night he died.

804
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:26,480
行了吧
We good?

805
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:44,490
我理解喪親之痛
I understand what it's like to lose a parent.

806
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:46,130
的確令人心碎
It's heartbreaking.

807
00:45:50,270 --> 00:45:51,600
你有沒有想過或許他是對的
Did you ever think he was right?

808
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:55,260
關于什么
About what?

809
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,210
那他害你摔傷
Hurting you that day?

810
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,290
因為你對他做的事
For what you did to him?

811
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:02,050
你想過或許你是活該嗎
You ever think you deserved it?

812
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:04,210
我沒對他做什么
I didn't do anything to him.

813
00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:05,630
我是想幫他
I was trying to help him.

814
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:07,100
你背叛了他的信任
