00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:17,220
混賬  看看今天股票怎么樣
Yeah. Fuckface, look at where the stock's at today, huh?

158
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:18,080
日你媽
You motherfucker,

159
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,180
要是44你什么也撈不到
you can't get any at 44...

160
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:22,560
-快他媽打電話去  -抱歉
- Pick up the cocksucking phone! - Sorry...

161
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,480
你真是個臭傻逼  漢納
You are such a fucking douchebag, Hanna.

162
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:30,320
我們才不管什么技術
We don't give two shits about how technology works

163
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,030
我們只關心他媽怎么能賺錢
because all we care about is getting fucking rich.

164
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,410
-定了  2000  -喬丹·貝爾福
- Solid, 2,000. - Jordan Belfort.

165
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:37,910
成功了
Done!

166
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,620
該抬價了[以不正當手段哄抬股價]
Time to paint the tape.

167
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:43,960
微軟  2000股  上鉤了
2,000. Microsoft. Going in the hole!

168
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,330
過來
Come on.

169
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,090
直播  拿著  小心燙手
Live. Live. Hold on, that is hot.

170
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:53,090
放進去  把那玩意關上  關上關上
In. In. Shut that motherfucker. Shut it! Shut it! Shut it!

171
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,300
成交了
Sold!

172
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,000
可卡因來點
Tootski?

173
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,500
不用了  謝謝
Oh, no. Thank you, though.

174
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,370
漢納先生
Mr. Hanna,

175
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,170
這么美好的午后  您要來點什么
what can I bring for you on this glorious afternoon?

176
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,960
赫克托  我告訴你怎么玩
Well, Hector, here's the game plan.

177
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:32,510
給我們上兩杯馬丁尼
You're gonna bring us two Absolut Martinis.

178
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:34,130
你知道我的口味  要純的
You know how I like them. Straight up.

179
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,840
整7分半后
And then precisely seven and one half minutes after that,

180
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:38,260
再上兩杯
you're gonna bring us two more.

181
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:41,640
然后每5隔分鐘上兩杯
Then two more after that every five minutes

182
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,930
直到我倆喝倒一個為止
until one of us passes the fuck out.

183
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,650
這想法不錯  先生
Excellent strategy, sir.

184
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:48,560
我現在喝水就好
I'm good with water for now.

185
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:49,980
謝謝
Thank you.

186
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:51,940
他今天剛來華爾街工作
It's his first day on Wall Street.

187
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:52,940
他會習慣的
Give him time.

188
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:55,740
-謝謝  -謝謝
- Thank you. - Thank you.

189
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,780
漢納先生
Mr. Hanna?

190
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:01,290
你白天嗑了藥
You're able to do drugs during the day

191
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,160
還能正常工作嗎
and then still function, still do your job?

192
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,080
不然你以為怎么正常工作
How the fuck else would you do this job?

193
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,330
就憑可卡因和妓女了  哥們
Cocaine and hookers, my friend.

194
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,840
是
Right.

195
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,520
我想說
Well, I got to say,

196
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:15,630
能加入你們我真的很高興
I'm incredibly excited to be a part of your firm. I mean...

197
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,590
你們的客戶實在是...
The clients you have are absolutely...

198
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,140
去他媽的客戶
Fuck the clients.

199
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,970
你唯一的職責就是引他們上鉤
Your only responsibility is to put meat on the table.

200
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,310
你有女朋友嗎
You got a girlfriend?

201
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,940
我結婚了
I'm married. I have a wife.

202
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,100
我妻子叫泰瑞莎  理發的
Her name is Teresa. She cuts hair.

203
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,480
-恭喜  -謝謝
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

204
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,900
多想想泰瑞莎
Think about Teresa.

205
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,150
你要干的就是
Name of the game.

206
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:37,070
把你客戶兜里的錢揣到你兜里
Move the money from your client's pocket into your pocket.

207
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,240
是
Right.

208
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,990
但如果同時能幫客戶賺錢
But if you make your clients money at the same time,

209
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,330
不是互惠互利嗎
it's advantageous to everyone. Correct?

210
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,160
不
No.

211
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,160
華爾街第一要義
Number one rule of Wall Street.

212
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,330
沒有人
Nobody...

213
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,640
不管你是沃倫·巴菲特也好
I don't care if you're Warren Buffett

214
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,590
吉米·巴菲特也好
or if you're Jimmy Buffett.

215
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:54,010
沒人知道股票是漲是跌
Nobody knows if a stock is gonna go up, down,

216
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,300
是持平還是兜圈子
sideways, or in fucking circles.

217
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,380
股票經紀人更不知道  懂嗎
Least of all stockbrokers, right?

218
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:01,050
都是掩的  你知道什么叫掩吧
It's all a fugazi. You know what a fugazi is?

219
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,510
"贗"嗎  就是假的
Fugayzie. It's a fake.

220
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,020
什么掩啊贗啊  嫖啊飄啊的
Fugayzi, fugazi, it's a whazy, it's a woozy, it's...

221
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,440
都是虛無縹緲的  根本不存在
Fairy dust. It doesn't exist.

222
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,310
看不見摸不著
It's never landed. It is no matter.

223
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,940
元素周期表上找不到
It's not on the elemental chart.

224
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,020
根本都他媽是假的
It's not fucking real.

225
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,940
-對不  -對
- Right? - Right.

226
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,740
繼續聽我講
Stay with me.

227
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:20,110
我們屁都不創造  什么都不建
We don't create shit. We don't build anything.

228
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,370
的確
No.

229
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:24,290
所以假設你有個客戶花8塊買了一股
So if you got a client who bought stock at eight

230
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:26,790
現在漲到16了  他樂開花了
and it now sits at 16, he's all fucking happy.

231
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,300
就想兌現清算
He wants to cash in, liquidate,

232
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,960
拿上錢打包走人
take his fucking money and run home.

233
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,000
-這可不行  -好的
- You don't let him do that. - Okay.

234
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,960
-因為那樣就成真錢了  -是
- 'Cause that would make it real. - Right.

235
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,300
那該做什么
No. What do you do?

236
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,340
你得繼續給他出金點子
You get another brilliant idea.

237
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,880
額外的想法
A special idea.

238
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,070
制造另一種"情況"
Another "situation."

239
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,550
讓他拿收益再投一支股票  不斷投
Another stock to reinvest his earnings and then some.

240
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,890
他每次也一定會投
And he will, every single time.

241
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,060
因為他們全都他媽是癮君子
'Cause they're fucking addicted.

242
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,890
你就一直這么干
And you just keep doing this,

243
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:51,230
延綿不斷  無休無止
again and again and again.

244
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:53,980
他這時覺得自己要成土豪了
Meanwhile, he thinks he's getting shit rich,

245
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,150
理論上他的確賺了
which he is, on paper.

246
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,900
但我們這些經紀人
But you and me, the brokers,

247
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,320
從中收的傭金
we're taking home cold hard cash

248
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,110
可都是實打實的現金  學著沒
via commission, motherfucker.

249
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,910
是
Right.

250
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:06,630
這太神奇了  老板
That's incredible, sir.

251
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:08,580
我都激動的無以言表了
I can't tell you how excited I am.

252
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,120
你就該興奮
You should be.

253
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:13,960
做經紀人這行的成功要素有兩點
There's two keys to success in the broker business.

254
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,630
首先
First of all...

255
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,670
-你得淡定  -是
- You gotta stay relaxed. - Yeah.

256
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,880
你平時擼嗎
Do you jerk off?

257
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,010
擼...擼嗎
Do I... Do I jerk off?

258
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,310
擼  擼啊  我當然擼
Yeah. Yeah, I jerk off. Yeah.

259
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,680
每周幾次
How many times a week?

260
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:30,350
三四次吧
Like three or four.

261
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,580
三四次  有時五次
Three or four times, maybe five.

262
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,730
你得多擼啊
Gotta pump those numbers up.

263
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:35,310
干這行  你這次數太菜鳥了
Those are rookie numbers in this racket.

264
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,070
我本人吧  每天至少兩發
I myself, I jerk off at least twice a day.

265
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:42,480
早晨健身之后來一發
Once in the morning right after I work out,

266
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,410
午飯后再來一發
then once right after lunch.

267
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:44,870
真的嗎
Really?

268
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:47,870
我喜歡擼  但我擼不是因為喜歡
I want to. That's not why I do it.

269
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:50,080
全他媽是被逼的
I do it 'cause I fucking need to.

270
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,660
你想想  你是跟數字打交道的
Think about it. You're dealing with numbers.

271
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,710
整天都是什么小數點啊  高頻交易啊
All day long, decimal points, high frequencies.

272
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,130
全他媽是數
Fucking digits.

273
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,630
每天重任在肩  喘不過氣啊
All very acidic above-the-shoulders mustard shit.

274
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,970
對吧
All right?

275
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,550
太讓人抓狂了  是吧
It kind of wigs some people out. Right.

276
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,760
所以就得多擼  保持血液流通順暢
You got to feed the geese to keep the blood flowing.

277
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:10,520
私底下控制住節奏
I keep the rhythm below the belt.

278
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,850
懂了
Done.

279
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,600
我這可不是提醒你  我給你開處方呢
This is not a tip, this is a prescription.

280
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:14,850
相信我
Trust me.

281
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,440
你不這么干  就沒法平衡了
If you don't, you will fall out of balance,

282
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,650
差額搞不清楚你就載了
split your differential and tip the fuck over.

283
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:21,030
還有更糟的
Or worse yet,

284
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:23,320
我親眼見過  猝死
I've seen this happen, implode.

285
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,860
別介  我可不想猝死  老板
No, I don't want to implode, sir.

286
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,120
當然  沒人想
No. No, you don't.

287
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,450
我干這行看得很長遠的
I'm in it for the long run, you know?

288
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:29,120
-猝死可不是什么好事  -是
- Implosions are ugly. - Yeah.

289
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,370
所以有空就去洗手間來一發
Pop off to the bathroom, work one out any time you can.

290
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,450
等你擼順手了
When you get really good at it,

291
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:33,580
一邊擼著
you'll fucking be stroking it

292
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,670
一邊腦子里想的都是錢
and you'll be thinking about money.

293
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:40,840
干這行成功要素之二
Second key to success in this racket

294
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,170
就是這瓶子里的寶貝
is this little baby right here.

295
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,630
叫可卡因
It's called cocaine.

296
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,010
是
Right.

297
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:46,940
能讓你耳聰目明
It'll keep you sharp between the ears.

298
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,930
還能讓你撥號指速如飛
It'll also help your fingers dial faster.

299
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:50,390
你猜怎么著
And guess what?

300
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,020
你撥號快了  我就賺了
That's good for me.

301
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,020
好了  先生
Yes, sir.

302
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:56,270
周轉不息  明白嗎
Revolutions. You follow?

303
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,440
周轉不息
Revolutions.

304
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,770
讓客戶坐上摩天輪
Keep the clients on the Ferris wheel.

305
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:00,740
我們就開賺
And it goes.

306
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,400
游樂園365天全天候給他開著
The park is open 24/7, 365,

說你娶了你表妹什么的  沒有嗎

但不是你以為的那樣
But it's not like what you think, or whatever, you know.

她是你的嫡表妹嗎  還是...

It's not like, what... You know.

610
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:34,010
我們一起長大
Look, we grew up together.

00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:36,470
她出落得很性感  真他媽性感
And she grew up hot, you know. She fucking grew up hot.

612
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:38,300
我朋友都想上她
And all my friends were trying to fuck her, you know.

613
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:40,270

讓這些傻逼上我表妹
You know, one of these assholes fuck my cousin,

615
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:45,480
我就用表哥的身份接近她

616
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,060
我可不會讓別人上我表妹
I'm not gonna let someone else fuck my cousin.

617
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:49,820
要有人上我表妹
You know, if anyone's gonna fuck my cousin,

618
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,780
那也得是我  出于尊重
it's gonna be me, out of respect. You know?

619
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:52,990
我明白
No, I get it. Yeah.

620
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:55,240
你不怕生孩子出事嗎
I mean, you're not afraid of like the whole kid thing, right?

621
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,530
-什么  跟她生孩子嗎  -是的
- What? Having kids with her? - Yeah.

622
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,820
不怕  我們有兩個孩子了
No. We have two kids.

623
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,370
他們...
And they're... I mean...

624
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:02,040
這不是人身攻擊  不過他們沒事嗎
I don't want to get personal, but they're okay?

625
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,250
沒有  他們不是弱智之類的
No, they're not retarded or anything like that.

626
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,250
但很有可能吧...
But there's a big chance, right, if...

627
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:08,670
是啊  大概60%
Yeah, there's like a 60%, you know,

628
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:12,260
60%到65%的機會孩子會是弱智
60% to 65% chance the kid's gonna be fucking retarded or whatever.

629
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:13,420
我他媽嚇尿了  老兄
That'd scare the shit out of me, buddy.

630
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:15,840
不管操的是不是表妹
Look, man, a lot of having a kid, or whatever, takes risk,

631
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:17,680
生孩子都有風險
whether you're fucking cousins or not.

632
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,510
如果你的孩子真是弱智怎么辦
What if something like that happened?

633
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,180
基本上  孩子要真是弱智
Basically, you know, if the kid was retarded,

634
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:25,560
我就開車到荒郊野外
I would, you know, drive it up to the country

635
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,310
打開車門然后說
and just, like, you know, open the door and say,

636
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,610
"你自由了"  "自由奔跑吧"之類的
"You're free now." You know, like, "Run free."

637
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,190
你懂的吧
You know?

638
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,950
你他媽逗我玩呢
You're completely fucking with me.

639
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,950
那太可怕了  你才不會...
That's horrible. You're not gonna...

640
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,620
你的樣子好像...不會
You look like you've... No.

641
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,540
我們會帶孩子去特殊機構什么的
We would take it to, like, an institution or somewhere

642
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:48,420
或是專門負責撫養孩子的地方
that's handled to, like, you know, raise the kid or whatever.

643
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,040
如果你很開心  那上帝保佑你
You know what? If you're happy, God bless you, buddy.

644
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:51,860

No, I'm not fucking happy. No one who's married is fucking happy.

誰他媽結婚了還會開心啊
No one who's married is fucking happy.

683
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:43,950
首先我們需要的就是經紀人

有銷售經驗的人
Guys with sales experience.

685
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,950

But he didn't go along with us.

694
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:08,810
他賣安眠酮已經賺飛了
He was already making so much money selling Quaaludes,

695
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:11,640
算是貝賽地區的安眠酮小王子

00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:29,370
伙計  她說這輩子也不想見你了

705
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:30,660

聽見沒  比你們想象的還容易
You listening? It's easier than you think.

709
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,210
每個接你電話的人
Every person you're on the phone with,

710
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,800
都做著一夜暴富的夢
they want to get rich and they want to get rich quickly.

711
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,050
都想空手套白狼
They all want something for nothing.

712
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:45,000

00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:46,590
{\an8}當代基督新教派別 以追求簡樸生活聞名

但嘴唇上不留胡子的
with like no mustache or some bullshit?

717
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:54,140
他就說他這輩子只想做家具
Well, he says that he only wants to make furniture.

718
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:56,980
-沒懂你意思  -這和我們說的有什么關系
- I don't understand. - What's that got to do with anything?

719
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:58,940
你他媽扯哪兒去了
What the fuck are you talking about?

720
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:00,900
不是我逼你說什么
I'm not putting words in your mouth or nothing,

721
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:04,150
但你剛說每人都想一夜暴富

722
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,660
我操  你剛確實說了

你們他媽扯哪兒去了
What the fuck are you talking about?

724
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,240
對啊  佛教徒也是  他們才不在乎錢
Yeah, like Buddhists. They don't give a shit about money.

725
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:13,330
他們只穿僧袍  也沒什么花銷
They're wrapped in sheets. They're not buying shit.

726
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:15,160
我又不是說佛教徒或門諾教徒
I'm not talking about Buddhists or Amish.

727
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:18,000
我是說普通人  工薪階級  平凡群眾
I'm talking about normal people, working-class, everyday people.

728
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,000
人人都想賺大錢  我說錯了嗎
Everyone wants to get rich. Am I crazy?

729
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:21,380
那種超凡脫俗的人根本不存在
There's no such thing as an Amish Buddhist.

730
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,340
-我敢保證  -真的有
- I'm pretty fucking sure. - There could be.

能來點番茄醬嗎  謝謝

732
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,140
難道你們這幫人也不想掙錢嗎
Do you guys not want to make money?

733

我想掙大錢啊

734
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:30,350
我他媽當然想掙錢
I want to make some fucking money, okay.

00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:31,760
我什么都能賣
I can sell anything.

736
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:33,770
我都能把安眠酮賣給修道院的修女
Shit, I can sell ludes to a convent full of nuns,

737
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:35,770
讓她們淫水泛濫高潮迭起
and get them so horny they'd be fucking each other.

738
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:37,690
要的就是這個態度  沒你賣不掉的東西是嗎
That's the attitude. You can sell anything?

739
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:39,360
來把這支筆賣給我

00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:45,150
等我吃完行嗎  一天沒吃飯了
Can I finish eating first? I haven't eaten today.

743
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,610
布拉德  教教他們該怎么做
Brad, show them how it's done. Boom.

744
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,200
把這支筆賣給我  都看好了  開始
Sell me that pen. Watch. Go on.

745
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,830
你要我把這破筆賣給你
You want me to sell this fucking pen?

746
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:53,410
這才是我哥們兒  什么都能賣
That's my boy right there. Can fucking sell anything.

747
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,500
幫我個忙
Why don't you do me a favor.

748
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:56,250
把你名字寫那張餐巾紙上
Write your name down on that napkin for me.

749
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:57,370
可我沒有筆呀
I don't have a pen.

750
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,170
賣給你了  這叫供需關系  伙計
Exactly. Supply and demand, my friend.

751
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:00,330
-簡直了  -我說什么來著
- Holy shit. - See what I'm saying?

752
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,790
他知道制造需求
He's creating urgency.

753
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,340
讓他們心甘情愿去買股票
Get them to want to buy the stock.

754
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:05,300
讓他們相信這是不可或缺的  明白嗎
Convince them it's something they need, you know what I mean?

755
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,550
關鍵就在這
And that's the thing.

756
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:08,130
修女全是同性戀
All nuns are lesbians.

757
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,140
你他媽又扯到哪兒去了  海獺
What the fuck are you talking about, Otter?

758
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:11,180
想想看  在修道院釣不到凱子
Think about it. They can't keep a dude

759
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,010
只好玩女人嘍
so they're gonna start fucking chicks.

760
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,220
我喊了四遍了  幾米  第四遍了
Four fucking times, Kimmie! Four times.

761
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:16,770
他沒跟上我們的思路
He's not with us.

762
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:18,190
她終于拿來了
Now she runs.

763
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:21,150
這幫人是沒念過哈佛工商管理碩士什么的
But look. I knew these guys weren't like Harvard MBAs.

764
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:22,930
羅比·范伯格  外號笨蛋
Robbie Feinberg, the pinhead,

765
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:25,150
用了5年才高中畢業
took five years to finish high school.

766
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,150
奧爾登·古佛博格  外號海獺  高中都沒念完
Alden Kupferberg, the Sea Otter, didn't even graduate.

767
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:30,630
切斯特·明  外號頹廢華人
Chester Ming, the depraved Chinaman,

768
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,490
一直以為柔道是以色列人發明的
thought jujitsu was in Israel.

769
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,040
當中最聰明的要屬尼基·克斯考夫
Smartest of the bunch was Nicky Koskoff.

770
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,790
他還真上過法學院
He actually went to law school.

771
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:40,290
我叫他魯格拉特因為他那頂傻逼假發
I called him Rugrat because of his piece of shit hairpiece.

772
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:44,210
就算來的是一群年輕  饑渴的蠢貨
Still, give them to me young, hungry and stupid,

773
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:47,340
要不了多久我都能讓他們發財
and in no time, I'll make them rich.

774
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:50,590
我的天
Oh, my God.

775
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:52,140
喬丹  這
Jordan, that...

776
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,550
喜歡嗎  寶貝
You like it, baby?

777
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,390
天哪  太漂亮了
Oh, my God, that's beautiful.

778
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,890
這不是世界上最大的鉆石
They're not the biggest stones in the world,

779
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,730
但我保證這都是上等貨
but I promise they're really high quality.

780
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:01,190
很漂亮
It's beautiful.

781
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,190
真的很漂亮
They're so beautiful.

782
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:04,770
天哪
Oh, boy.

783
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,280
怎么了
What?

784
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,860
我見過你這副表情  怎么了  說吧
I know that look. What is it? Go ahead.

785
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,610
不知道  就是
I don't know, it's... You know...

786
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,490
這些股票  這些公司
These stocks... These companies...

787
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:15,620
都是一些不入流的公司啊
They're like crappy companies.

788
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,990
-沒錯  -是吧
- Well, yeah. - Okay.

789
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,450
沒錯  它們都糟透了
Yeah, they're terrible.

790
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:20,630
別擔心  不是告訴過你嗎
Don't worry about it. I told you,

791
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:22,000
我做的都是合法生意
what I'm doing is completely legal.

792
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,170
我知道
Yeah, I know.

793
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:25,380
但那些投資人其實掙不到錢  對嗎
But they're not gonna make anyone money though, right?

794
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,260
時有時無吧
Well, sometimes they do, sometimes they don't.

795
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:29,760
投資本來就是這樣的
You know how it goes.

796
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:32,390
那把這種股票賣給
Wouldn't you feel better if you sold that stuff to rich people

797
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:35,430
不在乎這點小錢的富人不會更好嗎
who can, like, afford to lose all that money?

798
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,640
當然
Of course.

799
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:40,850
但有錢人是不會買仙股的
But rich people don't buy penny stocks.

800
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,810
事實就這樣
They just don't.

801
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:44,480
為什么
Why not?

802
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,650
因為他們都混成精了
Because they're too smart, that's why not.

803
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:52,740
只要是讀過大學的人
I mean, what person with a college education

804
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:53,920
有誰會相信這群混混呢
would trust this bunch of jerk-offs?

805
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,410
把電話掛了  說一會打回去
Hang up the phone. Tell him you'll call him back.

806
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:56,580
我他媽這正談著5000塊的生意呢
I got five fucking grand on the phone right now!

807
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:00,750
不過要是他們聽起來不像混混呢
But what if they didn't sound like a bunch of jerk-offs?

808
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:04,080
如果我教會他們怎么向有錢人推銷呢
What if I could teach them how to sell to people with money?

809
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:05,670
真正的有錢人
Real money.

810
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,920
所以我決定重新打造整個公司
So I decided to reinvent the company.

811
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:13,510
先生們  歡迎來到斯特拉頓·奧克蒙特
Gentlemen, welcome to Stratton Oakmont.

812
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:18,680
你們現在的目標是拿下美國那1%的首富
You schnooks will now be targeting the wealthiest 1% of Americans.

813
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,810
要撈就要撈大魚
We're talking about whales here.

814
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:22,770
就他媽《白鯨記》里那種
Moby fucking Dicks.

815
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:31,990
{\an8}《白鯨記》美國著名小說
描寫主人公亞哈船長追逐并殺死白鯨莫比·迪克的經歷

816
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:27,060
這份推銷詞  就是你們的魚叉
And with this script, which is now your new harpoon,

817
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:29,230
我將教會你們每一個人
I'm gonna teach each and every one of you

818
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,990
如何成為他媽的亞哈船長
to be Captain fucking Ahab.

819
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,700
懂了嗎
Get it? Huh?

820
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,160
什么船長
Captain who?

821
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,660
亞哈船長  就他媽的是
Captain Ahab. From the fucking...

822
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:40,330
那本書里來的  你這蠢貨  書里的
The book, motherfucker. From the book.

823
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:42,410
動動你的腦子
Turn your fucking brain on.

824
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,000
-去你媽的  -我操  羅比
- Fuck you. - Jesus fuck, Robbie.

825
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,920
聽我說  我們這家新公司有說法的
Listen to me. We're a new company with a new name.

826
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,170
一家讓客戶放心的公司
A company that our clients can believe in.

827
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:53,170
一家讓客戶信任的公司
A company that our clients can trust.

828
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:57,800
一家在華爾街根基深厚的公司
A firm whose roots are so deeply embedded into Wall Street

829
00:32:53,260 --> 00:33:01,310
{\an8}五月花號是英國移民駛往北美最為著名的一艘船只

830
00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:01,310
當年的創始人乘著五月花號破浪而來
that our very founders sailed over on the Mayflower

831
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:03,230
將斯特拉頓·奧克蒙特這個名字
and chiseled the name Stratton Oakmont

832
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:05,600
鐫刻在普里茅斯的堅巖上
right into Plymouth fucking Rock!

833
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:05,600
{\an8}普里茅斯巖為新移民踏上美洲大陸的第一塊石頭

834
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:06,980
明白了嗎
You got it?

835
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,230
我們的具體計劃是
What we're gonna do is this.

836
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:13,250
我們先推銷像迪斯尼  ATT  IBM
First we pitch 'em Disney, ATT, IBM,

837
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:13,250
{\an8}分別為美國電話電報公司  國際商業機器公司

838
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:14,490
這種藍籌熱門股
blue chip stocks exclusively.

839
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:16,740
他們熟知的這種大公司
Companies these people know.

840
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:20,870
等他們放松警惕  我們就開始賣狗屎
Once we've suckered them in, we unload the dog shit.

841
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:24,660
粉單和仙股才是我們的聚寶盆
The pink sheets, the penny stocks, where we make the money.

842
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,920
我們從中抽五成呢  乖乖
50% commission, baby.

843
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:30,000
用這種策略盈利的關鍵在于
Now the key to making money in a situation like this

844
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:33,090
一定要先下手為強
is to position yourself now before the settlement.

845
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:36,090
等《華爾街日報》都報道了再行動
Because by the time you read about it in The Wall Street Journal,

846
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,050
就為時已晚了
it's already too late.

847
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,260
然后你要做的就是等待
Then you wait.

848
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,430
耐心等待
You wait.

849
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,100
誰先開口誰傻逼
And whoever speaks first loses.

850
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,350
抱歉
Sorry...

851
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,940
感謝您來電告知我
I appreciate the call.

852
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,680
我得考慮考慮
I really have to give this some thought

853
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:53,230
再和我太太商量一下
and talk to my wife about it.

854
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,650
我想好了再給您答復可以嗎
Can I call you back?

855
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:56,030
他們在猶豫  對吧  他們得考慮考慮
They don't know, right? They gotta think about it,

856
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,520
得他媽問老婆
they gotta talk to their fucking wives,

857
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,490
或者去問他媽的牙仙什么的
or the fucking Tooth Fairy.

858
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,490
{\an8}美國民間傳說中的精靈

859
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:00,370
但那些都不是關鍵
Point is, it doesn't matter what the fuck they say.

860
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:01,810
唯一讓他們不敢砸錢的原因就是
The only real objection that they have

861
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:03,950
他們并不相信你們這幫人
is that they don't trust you guys.

862
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:07,520
公司血統
商機緊迫

863
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,660
他們憑什么相信你們  看看你們自己
And why should they trust you? I mean, look at you.

864
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:07,500
就一幫沒文化的推銷員  對吧
You're a bunch of fucking sleazy salesmen, right?

865
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:10,290
那你們該怎么辦呢
So, what do you say?

866
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:13,550
要是我能讓你7美元買進聯合碳化物
You mean to tell me that if I put you in at Union Carbide at seven

867
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:15,050
再32美元賣出
and took you out at 32.

868
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:17,720
11美元買入德州儀器  47美元賣出
Texas Instruments at 11 and took you out at 47.

869
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,260
16美元買入美國鋼鐵公司  41美元賣出
U.S. Steel at 16, took you out at 41.

870
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:21,130
你現在肯定跟我說
You wouldn't be saying to me right now,

871
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:23,890
切斯特  快幫我給迪斯尼投幾千股吧
"Chester, pick me up a few thousand shares of Disney!"

872
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:26,100
立刻  現在  趕快買
"On the spot, right now. Come on."

873
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,520
說真的  凱文  說真的  不是嗎
Honestly, Kevin? Honestly? Seriously?

874
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,940
我都不認識你
I don't know you.

875
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:31,310
你我陌不相識  你就給我電話陌生拜訪
You cold-called me. You're a total stranger.

876
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,860
我表示完全同意
I am in complete agreement with you.

877
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:34,230
我們互不相識
You don't know me, I don't know you.

878
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,940
請允許我做個自我介紹  我叫奧爾登·古佛博格
Let me introduce myself to you. My name is Alden Kupferberg.

879
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:38,360
-我叫羅比·范伯格  -我叫切斯特·明

我現在是斯特拉頓·奧克蒙特的高級副總裁
I'm Senior Vice President at Stratton Oakmont,

881
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:41,780
我計劃在明年內成為
and I plan on being one of the...

882
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:44,160
我公司頂尖的股票經紀人之一
top brokers in my firm next year.

883
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,160
我要邁錯一步可就沒戲了  斯坦利
And I'm not gonna get there by being wrong, Stanley.

884
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:48,250
我不得不說  你聽起來像是個
I do wanna say that you sound like a...

885
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:50,080
你像是個實誠人
You sound like a pretty sincere guy.

886
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:52,420
這投資不會讓你一夜暴富或赤貧

其實我們進駐頭一天就這么瘋了
Actually, the madness started on our very first day,

1031
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,860
我們的一個經紀人  本·詹納
when one of our brokers, Ben Jenner,

1032
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:17,070
讓一個銷售助理給他口交
christened the elevator by getting a blowjob

1033
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,700
給電梯破了處
from a sales assistant.

1034
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,660
她叫帕姆  我得承認
Her name was Pam, and to her credit,

1035
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:23,230
她的確技術超群
she did have this amazing technique,

1036
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:25,790
會那種瘋狂地套弄
with this wild twist and jerk motion.

1037
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,290
過了差不多一個月
About a month later,

1038
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:29,290
唐尼和我決定趁周六下午
Donnie and I decided to double-team her

1039
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,240
我倆妻子去買圣誕禮服時
on a Saturday afternoon while our wives were out

1040
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,380
和她來個二夾一
shopping for Christmas dresses.

1041
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,050
后來本娶了她
Eventually, Ben married her,

1042
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:36,090
我們都覺得挺神奇的
which was pretty amazing

1043
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:39,970
因為她給辦公室所有男的都吹過簫
considering she blew every single guy in the office.

1044
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:43,310
本后來因為抑郁3年后自殺了
Then he got depressed and killed himself three years later.

1045
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:47,850
我雇了我爸麥克斯做執行官來維持秩序
Anyway, I hired my dad, Max, to maintain order as the Enforcer.

1046
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,600
斯特拉頓自己的蓋世太保
Stratton's very own Gestapo.

1047
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:54,480
我們叫他瘋狂麥克斯因為他的急脾氣
We called him Mad Max because of his hair-trigger temper,

1048
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:55,950
簡直一觸即發
which could be set off by

1049
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:58,490
連電話鈴這點小事都能惹到他
something as innocuous as a ringing telephone.

1050
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,280
誰這么厚顏無恥
Who the fuck has the goddamn gall

1051
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:04,990
周二晚上給我家打電話
to call this house on a Tuesday night?

1052
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:07,250
真該死
God damn it!

1053
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:08,370
你要錯過片頭了
You're gonna miss it!

1054
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,290
拜托說點新鮮的
Please, tell me something I don't know.

1055
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:13,130
我等一星期就為了看《均衡》
I wait all week for the fucking Equalizer

1056
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:15,500
他們就非得這時候... 你好
and they have to fucking... Hello.

1057
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:17,300
但一接起電話
But as soon as he picked up the phone...

1058
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:18,670
吉尼  最近怎么樣  吉尼
Gene. How are you, Gene?

1059
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,720
他就開始用很奇怪的英國腔說話
... he'd affect this weird British accent.

1060
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,010
好的  吉尼  那太好了
Right-o, Gene, that'd be great.

1061
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:24,300
回見
Cheerio.

1062
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:25,430
特別的奇怪
It was absolutely bizarre.

1063
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,060
這該死的白癡
The fucking halfwit!

1064
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:28,180
-等他掛了電話  -你錯過片頭了
- He'd hang up... - You missed it!

1065
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:30,520
就又變回瘋狂麥克斯了
... and then he's Mad Max all over again.

1066
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:31,650
該死
Damn it!

1067
00:43:31,770 --> 00:43:33,940
告訴我剛講什么了  怎么了
All right, tell me what happened. What happened?

1068
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:36,150
他發現是他姑姑
Well, he discovered it was the mother's sister.

1069
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:37,650
他是誰  告訴我是誰
Who's he? Who? Tell me who...

1070
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,320
主角啊  你知道主角...
The main guy. You know who the main...

1071
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:40,490
主角
The main guy...

1072
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:42,910
是他姑姑  他發現她死了
It was his mother's sister. She showed up dead.

1073
00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:45,950
當然我們在斯特拉做的事情
Of course, Mad Max didn't have to know

1074
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,700
不用都讓瘋狂麥克斯知道
everything we were doing at Stratton.

1075
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:49,830
弄一個大的靶子  我們...
And then there's a big target and we...

1076
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,870
把他們扔向靶子  然后就粘上了
They get launched at the target. They stick.

1077
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,080
靶心里畫個美元符號
There's a bull's-eye and the bull's-eye's a dollar sign.

1078
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:55,250
扔得離靶心最近的
Whoever gets closer to the dollar sign

1079
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:56,300
得分最高
gets the most points.

1080
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:58,590
等著我把那小崩豆扔傻了
I'm gonna throw the shit out of this little fucking thing.

1081
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:00,590
要是他受傷了怎么辦
So if it gets hurt, what happens?

1082
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:01,970
到時我們肯定很瘋狂
'Cause we're gonna get fucking nuts.

1083
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:03,300
我覺得我們傷不到他們  他們可...
I don't think he's gonna get hurt. They're like...

1084
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:05,140
他們都結實得跟超人一樣
They got like superhuman strength.

1085
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:06,430
我覺得他不會有事的
I think he's gonna be fine.

1086
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:08,470
你別瞪著他眼睛看就行
You can't look him right in the eyes.

1087
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,680
別瞪著他眼睛看
You can't look him in the eye?

1088
00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:11,440
認真的  我看PBS臺說的
That's a fact. I saw it on PBS.

1089
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,400
他們會被你看毛然后發瘋的
They get confused and their wires get crossed.

1090
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:15,020
你得看著他們的下巴
You gotta look at their chin.

1091
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:16,150
看著像是我在看你
Like it looks like I'm looking at you

1092
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:17,230
但其實我在看你下巴
but I'm looking at your chin.

1093
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,010
我感覺你在跟我說話
I feel like you're addressing me right now,

1094
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:19,480
但你沒在跟我說話吧
but you're not, are you?

1095
00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:21,450
他們就像蒙娜麗莎一樣  不管你站哪里
They're like the Mona Lisa. They find eye contact,

1096
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:23,070
他們都能直視你
like, wherever you are standing in the room.

1097
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:24,360
然后就鎖定了
And they lock in.

1098
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:27,080
但我們還是有個限度的對吧
No, but there is a limit to what we can do with them?

1099
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,290
可以向他們身上扔東西
We're allowed to throw shit at 'em.

1100
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:29,790
我們可以扔吃的嗎  香蕉
We're allowed to throw food? Bananas.

1101
00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:31,330
隨便什么吃的  沒錯
Any food. Correct.

1102
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:32,460
但舉個例子  我就不大會
But, for example, what I wouldn't do is

1103
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:34,290
讓他把雞巴掏出來
maybe like tell him to pull his cock out

1104
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,080
然后找幾個妹子
and like get some of the girls to, you know,

1105
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:37,250
玩他什么的
fondle him and shit like that.

1106
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:38,340
那也...不能這么干嗎
That would be... That's unacceptable?

1107
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:39,420
這招我們先留著
Let's keep that in our back pocket.

1108
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,510
這人比較適合往靶子上扔
This guy is more about throwing at the dartboard.

1109
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:42,590
對  對  沒錯
Correct. Yes, yes, yes.

1110
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,050
他們就適合干這個使
The thing is, this is their gift, okay.

1111
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:46,180
天生就適合被拿來當飛鏢扔
They're built to be thrown like a lawn dart.

1112
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:47,470
跟飛鏢一樣頭重腳輕
They're top heavy like a lawn dart.

1113
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,560
就是為了讓你能投準的
So they're built for accuracy.

1114
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,600
天哪  我們能把他滾著玩么
Oh, my God. Can we bowl with this guy?

1115
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:51,770
那是他兄弟  羅比
That's his fucking brother, Rob.

1116
00:44:51,850 --> 00:44:53,190
羅比才是保齡球
His brother's the bowling ball.

1117
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:54,980
給他身上綁個滑板
The brother, you put a skateboard on him,

1118
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:56,360
把他綁在滑板上
you strap him to a skateboard,

1119
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:57,810
然后順著過道往瓶子上扔
you toss him down an alley at some pins.

1120
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:59,520
-這想法不錯  -絕對的
- No shit. That's interesting. - Swear to fucking God.

1121
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:01,610
-這個我們也要吧  -沒錯我們倆都要
- Can we get that guy? - Yeah, we'll get that guy, too.

1122
00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:03,780
但這上面說他兄弟同意露陰
But it says here this guy will show his cock. Yeah.

1123
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:05,110
-他倒是不長高  -他同意嗎
- Instead of growing up. Yeah. - He will?

1124
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,490
但他們挺易怒的
They are very ornery by the way,

1125
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:07,950
所以跟這些小不點得悠著點
so you gotta be very careful with these little guys.

1126
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:09,080
安全第一
Safety first.

1127
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,240
安全第一  好吧
Safety is first, all right?

1128
00:45:10,330 --> 00:45:12,200
在旁邊安排一個人拿著麻醉槍
I want somebody with a fucking tranquilizer gun

1129
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:13,910
出事兒了就擊暈他
ready to knock this fucker out.

1130
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,170
-我們要不要弄個...-梅斯催淚  高壓槍
- Do we want to get like a... - Mace. Taser guns.

1131
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:17,250
小氣槍怎么樣
A pellet gun maybe?

1132
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:18,460
不行  小氣槍會傷到他的
No, a pellet gun is gonna hurt him.

1133
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:19,880
我只想弄暈他  暈死就行
I just want him out. Knocked out cold.

1134
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:22,550
要我說我們還是認準法律漏洞
But I say we stick with the loophole. Right? Okay?

1135
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,550
要是我們不把他到人看
If we don't consider him a human,

1136
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:26,760
就單純的行為來講  我們就沒事
we just consider it an act, I think we're in the clear.

1137
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:27,890
就像飛天瓦倫達馬戲團
Like The Flying Wallendas.

1138
00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:29,930
死了不少人也沒人告他們
You know, a lot of those guys died but they never sued anybody.

1139
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:31,770
重要的是你們得記住
The important thing you guys gotta keep in mind

1140
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:33,680
他們互相會八卦的
is that these things gossip.

1141
00:45:33,810 --> 00:45:35,390
聚在一起就八卦
They get together and they gossip.

1142
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:36,850
-這點好  -我們最不希望看到的
- That's a good point. - And the last thing

1143
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:39,110
就是他們聚到一起然后說
that we need is them getting together and saying,

1144
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:40,770
他們嘲笑我們了
"Oh, they made fun of us."

1145
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:42,440
那會抹黑斯特拉頓的
Like, it's gonna make Stratton look bad.

1146
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:44,610
我就愛你這點  能想到這些破事
That's why I love you. You think of shit like that.

1147
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,700
等他們來了  就把他們當自己人  好嗎
When they come in, we treat it just like one of us. Okay?

1148
00:45:47,950 --> 00:45:51,080
自己人  咕咕咕咕  自己人
One of us. Gooble gobble, one of us.

1149
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,740
接納他們  自己人
We accept them, one of us!

1150
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:54,540
咕咕咕咕  自己人
Gooble gobble, one of us.

1151
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:55,960
接納他們  自己人
We accept them, one of us.

1152
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,080
咕咕咕咕  自己人
Gooble gobble, one of us!

1153
00:45:57,170 --> 00:45:58,460
喬丹  你爸來了
Jordan! Your Dad's coming.

1154
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:00,000
好像是運通卡賬單的事
Something about the American Express bill.

1155
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:01,250
你能別讓他來嗎
Can you get him out of here?

1156
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:02,500
能  你舔蛋去吧
Yeah. Lick my twat.

1157
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:03,840
沒  我認真的
No, I'm serious!

1158
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:06,260
該死  各位  假裝我們在工作
Fuck. Guys, act like we're working.

1159
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:07,800
你他媽有股票單嗎
You got any fucking stock forms?

1160
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:09,430
他來了  他來了
He's coming, he's coming.

1161
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:10,680
隨便編點什么
Make some shit up.

1162
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:12,760
我覺得要是我們把輝瑞制藥...
I think if we short Pfizer...

1163
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:17,770
一個月43萬嗎  喬丹
$430,000 in one month, Jordy, huh?

1164
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:19,850
你他媽的一個月
Four hundred and fucking

1165
00:46:19,850 --> 00:46:23,190
居然他媽的花43萬嗎
30,000 fucking dollars in one fucking month!

1166
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,440
早上好  那都是商務花費  淡定點
Good morning. They're business expenses. Relax.

1167
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:26,740
-商務花費嗎  -是
- Business expenses? - Yes.

1168
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:28,240
-喬丹  你看你這都是什么  -什么
- Jordy, look what you got here. - What?

1169
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:32,200
看這個  兩萬六美金一頓晚飯
Look at this. $26,000 for one fucking dinner!

1170
00:46:32,370 --> 00:46:33,990
不  這我能解釋
Okay. No, no. This could be explained.

1171
00:46:34,290 --> 00:46:36,500
爸  我們有客戶的  輝瑞制藥的客戶

你這配菜治癌癥的嗎
What are these sides? They cure cancer?

1178
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:52,350
問題是配菜的確治癌癥
The sides did cure cancer. That's the problem.

1179
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:53,850
所以才這么貴
That's why they were expensive.

1180
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:55,850
-你他媽閉嘴吧  -我認真的

你看這么形容合適不
Isn't that the perfect description for it?

1190

的確是這樣  但這都不是我干的
That is what it is. But none of these were charged to me.

1191

-是嗎  都是我們干的  -反正不是我

快他媽給他解釋清楚
Fucking explain this shit to him!

1194

I know you're upset about the dinner,

1204
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:36,980

1225
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:13,800
當然我每次都給

第二天就得去打青霉素了
you'd have to get a penicillin shot the next day

1233

倒不是說這種我們就不干了

她就是有點...你懂吧
She just doesn't... You know what I'm saying?

1242
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:48,710

有種氣味  吸引力什么的

1249
00:49:00,850 --> 00:49:02,680
每兩分鐘就得上個床嗎
We're jumping into bed every two minutes?

1250

-那可不行  -我很愛她

1278
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:55,110

but I need them to want to live like me, you get it?

1279
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:56,570
想過得像我一樣
To live like me.

1280
00:49:56,950 --> 00:49:58,030
喬丹
Jordy.

1281
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:01,870
你這么折騰早晚遭報應

你覺得我瘋了嗎
You're looking at me like I'm crazy.

瘋了  你這叫傷風敗俗
Crazy? This is obscene.

1284
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:10,750
的確傷風敗俗
It was obscene.

1285
00:50:11,090 --> 00:50:12,460
在現實世界中的確如此
In the normal world.

1286
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,960
但誰愿意活在現實中
But who the fuck wanted to live there?

1287
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:18,800
一起狂歡到屌炸天吧
Go party your fucking cocks off!

1288
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:25,770
我們將成為華爾街的
We are about to become fucking legends

1289
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:27,730
傳奇
on Wall Street!

1290
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:32,320
我們的規劃將帶領公司
We got plans up here that's gonna take this company

1291
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,360
一路沖上平流層
into the fucking stratosphere!

1292
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:40,120
狼仔  狼仔
Wolfie! Wolfie!

1293
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,910
去他媽的梅林銀行  管他呢
Fuck Merrill Lynch. Fuck them.

1294
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:46,980
憑什么總讓他們
Why should they be taking

1295
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:48,540
賺走我們的錢
all our fucking money all the fucking time?

1296
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:49,790
這樣我們就是證券承銷商了
This way we become the underwriters.

1297
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,420
我們下一步棋
It was our next big move.

1298
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:55,090
就是找公司幫他們做首次公開募股
Finding companies to take public. IPOs.

1299
00:50:55,170 --> 00:50:56,970
這有這樣  那些華爾街的小崽子們
It was the only way these Wall Street pricks

1300
00:50:57,050 --> 00:51:00,760
才能不把我們當做野雞證券交易所
would ever stop thinking of us as some shitkicker bucket shop.

1301
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:02,050
我們還有阿克利夫國際
We got Arncliffe International.

1302
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:03,680
我們做事比較不尋常
See, we were a little different.

1303
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,100
我們談正事的時候
We liked to get as fucked up as possible

1304
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:07,350
喜歡嗑藥并喝得酩酊大醉
during our business powwows

1305
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,890
這樣才能才思泉涌
in order to stimulate our free-flowing ideas,

1306
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:12,980
所以我們吃安眠酮就像吃巧克力豆一樣
which is why we were popping these ludes like they were M&M's.

1307
00:51:13,690 --> 00:51:15,150
史蒂夫·麥登
Steve Madden.

1308
00:51:16,650 --> 00:51:17,820
那家公司歸我們了
We own the fucking companies...

1309
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:19,700
絕對歸我們了
We own the companies...

1310
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:21,700
不知道安眠酮是什么  我告訴你
Don't know what a lude is? I'll tell you.

1311
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:23,830
等等  等等
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1312
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:25,550
貌似安眠酮
Looks like those ludes

1313
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:28,660
正在唐尼身上顯神跡呢
are working their magic on Donnie right now.

1314
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:03,450
鎮定安眠酮
The Quaalude,

1315
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:06,450
一般叫作安眠酮
or lude, as it is commonly referred to,

1316
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:09,940
于1951年由一位印度醫生首次合成
was first synthesized in 1951 by an Indian doctor,

1317
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:11,790
是點紅點的印度人  不是印第安人
 that's dots, not feathers,

1318
00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:14,600
當時被當做鎮定催眠藥開給
as a sedative, and was prescribed to

1319
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:17,210
壓力大的家庭婦女緩解睡眠障礙的
stressed-out housewives with sleep disorders.

1320
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:20,130
但很快就有人發現
But pretty soon someone figured out

1321
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:23,970
服藥后只要忍住15分鐘不睡
that if you resisted the urge to sleep for just 15 minutes,

1322
00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:26,390
就能爽翻天了
you got a pretty kick-ass high from it.

1323
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:30,390
當然沒過多久大家就開始濫用安眠酮了
Didn't take long for people to start abusing ludes, of course.

1324
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,650
1982年美國和全世界都把安眠酮
And in 1982, the U.S. Government Schedule 1'd them.

1325
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:35,900
列為了一級管控藥物
Along with the rest of the world.

1326
00:52:36,230 --> 00:52:39,280
所以說安眠酮數量有限越吃越少
Which meant there was only a finite amount of these things left.

1327
00:52:39,570 --> 00:52:42,320
認真的  買都買不到
No shit, you can't even buy 'em anymore.

1328
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:44,910
你們都慘了
You people are all shit out of luck.

1329
00:52:45,070 --> 00:52:46,490

Those giant-headed girls with the bug eyes

1334
00:52:56,670 --> 00:52:58,290
穿著笨重的高跟鞋
wearing those big clunky shoes?

1338
00:53:05,010 --> 00:53:08,720
整條華爾街的人都想幫他上市
And all of Wall Street was begging to take his company public.

1339
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:10,060
來啊  你要說什么
Go ahead, go ahead, what is it?

1340
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:11,430
但你猜他跟誰是發小
Except, guess who grew up with him?

他們走了以后  我檢查了下屋子
After they left, I checked the apartment.

1540
01:02:58,270 --> 01:02:59,350
然后呢
Right. What?

1541
01:02:59,690 --> 01:03:01,520

1548
01:03:11,950 --> 01:03:13,120
我們從頭開始

我們從頭開始好吧
Let's start from the beginning, all right?

你叫了一些朋友來對吧
You invited some friends over, right?

1551
01:03:16,370 --> 01:03:18,040
莫名其妙的局勢就失控了
One thing led to another. Things got out of hand.

1552
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:19,620
這我們可以理解
We understand that, we do.

1553

1557
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,800
我說過了  我不知道您的錢在哪
Like I said, I don't know where your money is.

1558
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:30,260
我們從頭開始  都有誰來
Just start from the beginning. Who came over?

1559
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:31,390
那天和平時一樣
It was just a normal day.

1560

我知道你們下一天才回來

Chester and Toby, they went all yakuza on Nicholas.

1605
01:04:56,390 --> 01:04:57,470
他們玩嗨了
You know, they got crazy.

1606
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:58,600
我不知道
I don't know!

1607
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:00,280
我不得不叫警察來
I had to call the cops

1608
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:02,310
以免他們把那個可憐的家伙殺了
just to keep them from killing the poor guy.

1609
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:03,650
我給了他們每人1000塊
I gave them each 1,000

1610
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:06,020
告訴他們尼古拉斯做的好事
bucks and told them what Nicholas had done.

1611
01:05:06,310 --> 01:05:07,690
結果他們也狠揍了他一頓
Then they kicked his ass.

1612
01:05:08,150 --> 01:05:09,530
謝謝  警官
Thanks again, Officer.

1613
01:05:09,860 --> 01:05:12,530
其實我不怎么在乎那五萬
It's not like I cared about the 50 grand anyway.

1614
01:05:12,610 --> 01:05:14,240
我幾乎每天都能掙那么多
I was making that much almost every day

1615
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:16,570
從隨便哪個老鼠倉里
through one rathole or another.

1616
01:05:16,660 --> 01:05:19,410
老鼠倉就是朋友開的戶  比如布拉德
Now a rathole is a friend, like Brad here,

1617
01:05:19,490 --> 01:05:22,040
他以他的名義幫我持有股票
who held stock in his name for me.

1618
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:24,370
你是誰  猶太人版杰克·尼克勞斯嗎
Who are you supposed to be, huh? Jack Nickle-Jew?

1619
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:24,370
{\an8}杰克·尼克勞斯  美國著名高爾夫運動員

1620
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:26,160
我把價格抬上去后
I'd drive the price up then

1621
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:29,250
他把股票賣掉  然后把大部分利潤還給
he'd sell and kick most of the profits back to...

1622
01:05:29,340 --> 01:05:31,170
沒錯  給我
You guessed it, me.

1623
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:36,470
都是現金  都不在賬上
All cash. None of it's on the books.

1624
01:05:36,550 --> 01:05:38,850
當然是違法的
A big no-no, of course, in the eyes of the law.

1625
01:05:39,890 --> 01:05:42,850
我們有了新的證券律師  曼尼·瑞絲金
Enter our new securities attorney, Manny Riskin.

1626
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:46,680
我們付他每小時700元聽他的恐嚇
700 bucks an hour to be the voice of doom.

1627
01:05:46,690 --> 01:05:48,440
聽著  你要是招惹了證監會
Listen to me. You piss up the SEC's leg,

1628
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:49,730
一定會吃不了兜著走
you end up with your tits in a wringer.

1629
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:52,820
不過別擔心  證監會的我已經打點好了
Do not worry about it. I have the SEC under control.

1630
01:05:53,190 --> 01:05:55,650
這些傻逼們在干嘛
What the fuck are these imbeciles doing?

1631
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:58,490
你們在搞什么玩意兒
What are you doing? Hey!

1632
01:05:58,660 --> 01:06:00,530
證監會的人來了
We got the SEC in here.

1633
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:02,700
證券交易委員會
The Securities and Exchange Commission

1634
01:06:02,790 --> 01:06:05,370
派了兩名律師來查我們的文件
sent two lawyers down to review our files.

1635
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:07,370
我把他們安排在了會議室
So I set them up in our conference room

1636
01:06:07,460 --> 01:06:08,540
放了竊聽器
and I had it bugged

1637
01:06:08,630 --> 01:06:10,840
把空調開到最猛
and the air conditioning turned up so high

1638
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:12,460
讓里面冷得像南極一樣
that it felt like Antarctica in there.

1639
01:06:12,550 --> 01:06:14,510
這一直都這么冷嗎
Is it always this cold in here?

1640
01:06:14,590 --> 01:06:15,630
不知道
I don't know.

1641
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:16,880
當他們在那里
Then, while they were looking

1642
01:06:16,970 --> 01:06:18,390
尋找我的罪證時
for a smoking gun in that room...

1643
01:06:18,470 --> 01:06:20,260
阿克利夫國際現在很火
Arncliffe International is on fire.

1644
01:06:20,970 --> 01:06:23,600
我正在這里大張旗鼓
I was gonna fire off a bazooka in here,

1645
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:25,930
為我們的最近的IPO做準備
offering up our latest IPO.

1646
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:28,520
IPO的意思是首次公開募股
An IPO is an initial public offering.

1647
01:06:28,610 --> 01:06:29,990
是指一家企業首次
It's the first time a stock

1648
01:06:29,990 --> 01:06:32,360
將股票向公眾出售
is offered for sale to the general population.

1649
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:34,320
作為負責上市的機構
Now, as the firm taking the company public,

1650
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:36,070
我們來制定發行價
we set the initial sales price

1651
01:06:36,150 --> 01:06:38,910
再把股票賣回給我們的朋友  那些
then sold those shares right back to our friends. The...

1652
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:40,620
好吧
Look.

1653
01:06:40,740 --> 01:06:42,580
我知道你壓根不懂我在說什么
I know you're not following what I'm saying anyway, right?

1654
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:44,620
沒關系  無所謂
That's okay. That doesn't matter.

1655
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:46,540
關鍵在于
The real question is this.

1656
01:06:46,620 --> 01:06:48,500
這合法嗎
"Was all this legal?"

1657
01:06:48,580 --> 01:06:50,460
必須他媽的不合法
Absolutely fucking not.

1658
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:53,250
但我們能賺到多得不知道怎么花的錢
But we were making more money than we knew what to do with.

1659
01:06:57,630 --> 01:06:58,760
在錢多得不知道怎么花的時候
And what do you do when you're making

1660
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:00,300
你要怎么花呢
more money than you know what to do with?

1661
01:07:06,310 --> 01:07:07,730
我的天啊
Oh, my God!

1662
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:09,770
你愿意嫁給我嗎
Will you marry me?

1663
01:07:10,310 --> 01:07:11,650
天啊
Oh, my God.

1664

你是答應了嗎
Is that a yes?

1665

米拉奇辦了單身派對

1670
01:07:33,630 --> 01:07:35,840
從飛機上就開始縱酒狂歡了
The flight there alone was a bacchanal.

1671
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:40,050
成家前的最后放縱
One last blowout for the gods before I settled down for good.

1672
01:07:40,470 --> 01:07:41,890
上百名斯特拉頓人

1673
01:07:41,970 --> 01:07:42,710
50個妓女
50 hookers,

01:07:42,710 --> 01:07:44,760
落地了還有50個

這么說吧  我們飛機

就像是插上翅膀的藥房

才能安全地洞房

01:12:08,070 --> 01:12:10,240
威尼斯
Venice...

01:12:10,740 --> 01:12:12,820
威尼斯  親愛的  你在哪
Venice, baby, where are you?

1753
01:12:13,530 --> 01:12:17,040
威尼斯
Venice!

1754
01:12:17,410 --> 01:12:18,830
你去哪了
Where'd you go?

1755
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:25,670
親愛的  你要玩狠的是吧
Oh, baby. Oh, you're gonna play rough, huh?

1756
01:12:25,750 --> 01:12:27,920
-天啊  -你喜歡嗎
- Oh, Jesus Christ! - You like that?

1757
01:12:30,260 --> 01:12:32,380
我喜歡  我喜歡
I like it. I like it.

1758
01:12:32,550 --> 01:12:34,260
小狼  小狼  小狼  小狼
Wolfie, Wolfie, Wolfie, Wolfie.

1759
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:35,470
小狼?
Wolfie?

1760
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:36,850
是我的安全詞  是我的安全詞
Yeah, it's my safe word, baby. It's my safe word.

1761
01:12:36,930 --> 01:12:38,350
我他媽才不管你的安全詞呢
I don't give a fuck about your safe word!

1762
01:12:38,430 --> 01:12:40,520
-拜托  -你他媽閉嘴
- Come on! - Shut the fuck up!

1763
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:42,980
閉嘴  小賤貨
Shut up, you little bitch!

1764
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:45,560
你真是個下流的妞
You're a fucking dirty little birdy!

1765
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:48,650
對了
That's right.

1766
01:12:48,780 --> 01:12:50,030
對了  我忘了
That's right! I forgot.

1767
01:12:50,150 --> 01:12:51,610
我都忘了  寶貝
I forgot, baby.

1768
01:12:51,740 --> 01:12:56,030
唐尼和我在威尼斯投資了個酒店公寓
Donnie and I were investing in a condominium complex in Venice.

1769
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:57,240
所以你誤會了
That's why all this confusion.

1770
01:12:57,330 --> 01:12:58,870
你還去意大利投資了
Oh, you're investing in Italy?

1771
01:12:58,950 --> 01:13:00,660
不是意大利  是加州
Not Italy. California.

1772
01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:02,250
-是嗎  加州  -對
- Oh, California? - Yeah.

1773
01:13:02,330 --> 01:13:03,460
鬼話連篇的混蛋
You're a lying piece of shit!

1774
01:13:03,540 --> 01:13:04,710
公爵夫人  親愛的
Duchess, baby, come on.

1775
01:13:04,790 --> 01:13:06,330
你他媽別叫我夫人
Don't you fucking "Duchess" Me.

1776
01:13:06,460 --> 01:13:07,880
別叫我夫人
Don't you "Duchess" Me!

1777
01:13:08,130 --> 01:13:11,090
你以為我不知道你的小伎倆
Do you really think that I don't know what you're up to?

1778
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:13,090
-你是有孩子的人了  喬丹  -是啊
- You're a father now, Jordan. - Yeah.

1779
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:14,590
-你該像個父親樣  -我知道
- You're a father now. - I know...

1780
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:16,390
可你做事還那么幼稚
And you're still acting like an infant!

1781
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:19,350
去你媽的
God damn it!

1782
01:13:19,430 --> 01:13:22,100
寶貝  你得管管你的臭脾氣了
Baby, you know, you got real anger issues.

1783
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:24,520
是誰凌晨三點了
Who is the one who flew in here

1784
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:27,480
才開著傻逼直升機回來
at 3 in the morning on their stupid helicopter

1785
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:29,610
還吵醒了斯凱拉  是你
and woke up Skylar? That was you!

1786
01:13:29,690 --> 01:13:32,320
吵醒了斯凱拉  簡直是屁話
Oh, Skylar! Oh, fucking bullshit!

1787
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:47,130
你有注意過我剛給高爾夫場
Does it even matter to you that I just had that driving range

1788
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:50,420
鋪了百慕大草嗎  喬丹
sodded with Bermuda grass, Jordan,

1789
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:50,420
{\an8}百慕大草  一種暖季型高爾夫用草

1790
01:13:50,510 --> 01:13:52,550
-全都被你毀了  -天啊  百慕大草
- and now you fucking wrecked it! - Oh, my God... Bermuda grass.

1791
01:13:52,630 --> 01:13:54,380
你連看都不看
No, you didn't research the whole thing

1792
01:13:54,470 --> 01:13:56,550
也從來不和高爾夫球場的人打交道
and deal with the fucking golf course people!

1793
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:57,800
天啊
Oh, my God,

1794
01:13:57,890 --> 01:14:00,430
你還得和球場的人打交道
you had to deal with the golf course people, too!

1795
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:03,180
真是悲劇啊  親愛的  天啊
What a Greek tragedy, honey! Oh, my God!

1796
01:14:03,310 --> 01:14:06,190
你是不是還得親手付他們現金啊
You probably had to pay them in cash with your hands!

1797
01:14:06,270 --> 01:14:07,480
辛苦你了
What a fucking burden.

1798
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:09,520
除了整天刷我的信用卡之外
And actually do some work

1799
01:14:09,610 --> 01:14:11,730
還得做這么辛苦的事  是吧
besides swiping my fucking credit card all day, huh?

1800
01:14:11,820 --> 01:14:14,530
我都跟不上你的職業變化了  親愛的
Because I can't keep track of your professions, honey.

1801
01:14:14,610 --> 01:14:16,490
上個月你還是紅酒鑒定家
'Cause last month you were a wine connoisseur.

1802
01:14:16,570 --> 01:14:18,620
現在又成了高雅的景觀設計師
Now you're an aspiring landscape architect!

1803
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:20,370
-這么說吧...別  -去你媽的
- Let me get that right... No! - Fuck you!

1804
01:14:20,450 --> 01:14:22,450
你敢把水潑來試試
Don't fucking dare throw that fucking water at me.

1805
01:14:22,540 --> 01:14:25,000
你敢潑
Don't you fucking dare.

1806
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:27,370
冷靜  親愛的
All right, honey?

1807
01:14:27,750 --> 01:14:28,960
你能不能...
Now will you just...

1808
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:30,920
我們談談吧  好嗎
We could talk this out, all right?

1809
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,380
動口不動手  知道嗎
We just use our words. You know?

1810
01:14:33,460 --> 01:14:34,550
交流
Communicate.

1811
01:14:34,630 --> 01:14:35,840
行嗎
Okay?

1812
01:14:36,380 --> 01:14:37,680
來吧  親愛的
Come on, sweetheart.

1813
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:39,720
說說話  談談
Talk to me. Talk to me.

1814
01:14:39,850 --> 01:14:41,890
別再秀肌肉了  喬丹
Stop flexing your muscles, Jordan.

1815
01:14:41,970 --> 01:14:43,680
看著跟腦殘一樣
You look like a fucking imbecile.

1816
01:14:43,770 --> 01:14:45,060
寶貝  別這樣
Babe, come on.

1817
01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:48,310
你丈夫身材這么好
You should feel happy you got a husband

1818
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:50,650
你該高興啊
who's in such great shape like this, huh?

1819
01:14:51,570 --> 01:14:52,690
過來
Come here.

1820
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:54,320
過來  親親我
Come on, give me a kiss.

1821
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:55,440
你看起來美極了
You look so beautiful right now.

1822
01:14:55,570 --> 01:14:56,650
-來吧  -親你?

01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:01,910
操
Fuck you!

1826
01:15:01,990 --> 01:15:03,990
沒錯  早晨的慣例
Ah, yes, my morning ritual.

1827
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,450
起床先跟內奧米
First I'd get up and fight with Naomi

1828
01:15:06,540 --> 01:15:08,750
就前一晚的什么傻事吵架
about whatever it is I did the night before.

1829
01:15:08,830 --> 01:15:11,040
然后蒸個桑拿
Next was a steam so I could sweat out

1830
01:15:11,130 --> 01:15:12,880
排掉留在身體里的毒品
the drugs still in my system.

1831
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:14,590
然后評估一下損失
Then I'd assess the damage.

1832
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:16,590
滴眼藥水
Drown out my eyeballs.

1833
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:19,220
吃點"背痛藥"  開始這一天
Take my "Back pills" To get the day started,

1834
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:21,390
然后想法兒跟內奧米和好
then seek to make up with Naomi.

1835
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:23,430
早上好  爸比
Good morning, Daddy.

1836
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:25,600
給人家的親親呢
Where's my kiss?

1837
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:29,060
小甜心
Hey, sweetheart.

1838
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:33,820
爸比可以跟兩個甜心都親親嗎
Does Daddy get a kiss from both of his little girls, huh?

1839
01:15:33,940 --> 01:15:35,280
不行
Oh, no.

1840
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:38,450
爸比不能碰媽咪
No, Daddy doesn't even get to touch Mommy

1841
01:15:38,530 --> 01:15:40,280
很久很久
for a very, very,

1842
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:42,120
都不能碰
very long time.

1843
01:15:42,660 --> 01:15:45,410
爸比對剛才的話非常抱歉
Daddy's really sorry about what he said in the other room.

1844
01:15:45,490 --> 01:15:46,700
那都是氣話
He didn't mean any of it.

1845
01:15:46,790 --> 01:15:49,080
爸比不用浪費口舌
Daddy shouldn't waste his time.

1846
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:51,210
從現在起
And from now on,

1847
01:15:52,630 --> 01:15:54,790
媽咪在家只會穿
it's gonna be nothing but short,

1848
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,210
超短的小裙子了
short skirts around the house.

1849
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:02,300
你知道嗎  爸比
And you know something else, Daddy?

1850
01:16:03,950 --> 01:16:08,940
媽咪好討厭穿小內褲啊
Mommy is just so sick and tired of wearing panties.

1851

她已經把內褲
she's decided to throw them

1854
01:16:21,780 --> 01:16:24,990
都丟掉了
all away.

1855
01:16:30,790 --> 01:16:32,670
看好了  爸比
So take a good look, Daddy.

1856
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:36,130
以后在家會經常看到哦
You're gonna be seeing an awful lot of this around the house.

怎么了  爸比
What's wrong, Daddy?

1862
01:16:50,180 --> 01:16:51,520
寶貝
Baby.

1863
01:16:53,650 --> 01:16:54,850

1868
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:15,210
他的眼睛有點奇怪  是吧
His eyes seem to be a little bit odd, don't they?

1869
01:17:15,710 --> 01:17:19,170
是啊  眼睛有點奇怪
Yeah, there's something a little bit different about his eyes.

1870

她偏偏挑今天來挑逗我

01:18:29,700 --> 01:18:32,290
非他媽的在發行日嗎
On cocksucking, motherfucking new issue day?

1900
01:18:32,410 --> 01:18:33,580
你就干這個
This is what you do?

1901
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:36,540
大家聽著
Hey, everybody, listen up!

1902
01:18:37,170 --> 01:18:38,160
發行日這天還玩寵物
This is what happens when

1903
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:39,790
就是這個下場
you fuck with your pets on new issue day!

1904
01:18:53,470 --> 01:18:55,310
戴著你的小領結
Take your little bow tie, get your shit,

1905
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:57,480
收攤子走人  聽懂了嗎
and get the fuck out of my office! You understand?

1906
01:18:57,560 --> 01:18:59,060
滾蛋
Get the fuck out!

1907
01:19:02,730 --> 01:19:04,230
各就各位
Everybody on point!

1908
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:07,240
你們是來這賺錢的  各就各位
We are here to make money. Everybody on point.

1909
01:19:09,740 --> 01:19:12,490
這兒就是個狼窩  而我愛的也正是這點
A real wolf pit, which is exactly how I liked it.

1910
01:19:12,580 --> 01:19:14,420
喬丹  看看我在大廳遇到誰了
Jordan, look what I caught in the lobby.

1911
01:19:14,430 --> 01:19:15,200
遇到個天才
I caught a genius.

1912
01:19:15,330 --> 01:19:16,750
那就是史蒂夫·麥登
Enter Steve Madden.

1913
01:19:16,870 --> 01:19:17,960
偉大的美國鞋匠
The great American cobbler.

1914
01:19:18,040 --> 01:19:20,420
炙手可熱的女鞋制造者
Red-hot ladies footwear impresario.

1915
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:22,240
多虧了唐尼
And thanks to Donnie,

1916
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:24,090
我們才能幫他的公司上市
we were taking his company public.

1917
01:19:24,170 --> 01:19:27,880
斯特拉頓·奧克蒙特爬出原始的泥濘
Stratton Oakmont was crawling out of the primordial ooze.

1918
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:29,970
再也不是井底之蛙了
Pond scum no more.

1919
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:31,590
所以得讓他們見見你
That's why they gotta see your face.

1920
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:32,560
你要鼓舞士氣
You get them fired up so

1921
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:34,140
大家才能拼命賣股票  好嗎
they push the shit out of this stock. Okay?

1922
01:19:34,220 --> 01:19:36,810
不僅如此  唐尼和我
And not only that, Donnie and I secretly owned

1923
01:19:36,890 --> 01:19:39,190
秘密持有史蒂夫·麥登鞋業85%的股份
85% of Steve Madden Shoes,

1924
01:19:39,770 --> 01:19:41,770
這是法律絕對不允許的
which legally speaking was a big no-no,

1925
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:45,230
但我們打算著狠狠撈上一筆
but we'd get filthy fucking rich if our troops got behind it.

1926
01:19:45,570 --> 01:19:47,820
我們要鼓舞士氣
Our job was to get them worked up.

1927
01:19:47,990 --> 01:19:49,700
但也不能太士氣高漲了
But not too worked up.

1928
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:52,490
大家好
Hello. If...

1929
01:19:53,530 --> 01:19:55,700
如果有不認識我的
For those of you who don't know me...

1930
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,040
我叫史蒂夫·麥登
My name's Steve Madden.

1931
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:58,660
我們知道你是誰
Yeah, we know who you are.

1932
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:00,250
盒子上都印著你的名字呢
Your name is on the box.

1933
01:20:00,460 --> 01:20:02,000
拿鞋子  給他們看看鞋子
Get the shoes. Show them the shoes.

1934
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:03,670
-給他們看看鞋子  -好
- Show them the shoes. - Okay. Yeah.

1935
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:06,960
這鞋子很酷的
Anyway, you know, this shoe is pretty cool.

1936
01:20:07,050 --> 01:20:07,910
叫瑪麗璐
This is the Mary Lou,

1937
01:20:07,910 --> 01:20:09,880
我的成名作
which is really the shoe that put me on the map.

1938
01:20:09,970 --> 01:20:11,550
如果沒有它  我就不會站在這
Without it, I wouldn't be here.

1939
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:12,800
這是給胖妞穿的
It's a fat girls' shoe!

1940
01:20:12,890 --> 01:20:14,850
不管你信不信
Believe it or not... Believe it or not though,

1941
01:20:14,970 --> 01:20:16,220
瑪麗璐實際上和瑪麗珍同款
the Mary Lou is actually the

1942
01:20:14,970 --> 01:20:16,220
{\an8}瑪麗珍  背帶式平底女鞋

1943
01:20:16,220 --> 01:20:18,270
只不過是黑色皮質的
same as the Mary Jane, but it's black leather.

1944
01:20:24,690 --> 01:20:27,570
反擊  是誰扔的  是誰扔的
Fight back! Come on! Where you at? Where you at?

1945
01:20:27,860 --> 01:20:29,150
好了
All right!

1946
01:20:29,240 --> 01:20:32,490
掌聲送給史蒂夫·麥登和他超贊的瑪麗璐
Let's give it up for Steve Madden and his awesome Mary Lou!

1947
01:20:32,570 --> 01:20:34,740
舉起來  舉起來  自豪地舉起來
Hold that up. Hold that up. Hold that up proud!

1948
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:37,290
掌聲獻上
Give him a round of applause!

1949
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:40,620
發泄完了嗎
You guys got that out of your systems, huh?

1950
01:20:41,580 --> 01:20:43,580
下午過得怎么樣
You having a good afternoon or what?

1951
01:20:44,130 --> 01:20:47,170
我要花點時間  告訴你們
I wanna take a moment and tell you why Steve here is so

1952
01:20:47,250 --> 01:20:49,550
為什么說史蒂夫與眾不同
absolutely off the fucking wall.

1953
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:54,340
因為他是個創作天才
It's because this man is a creative genius.

1954
01:20:54,930 --> 01:20:58,430
史蒂夫的能力和天賦
This ability, this gift that Steve has,

1955
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:01,850
不是緊跟女鞋時尚潮流
it goes beyond just spotting the hottest shoe trends.

1956
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:05,690
而是他  能引領潮流
Steve's power is that he creates trends.

1957
01:21:06,020 --> 01:21:07,440
懂嗎
You understand?

1958
01:21:07,650 --> 01:21:09,730
史蒂夫這樣的藝術家十年難遇
Artists like Steve come along once every decade.

1959
01:21:09,820 --> 01:21:12,250
就像喬治· 阿瑪尼  詹尼·范思哲
I'm talking Giorgio Armani, Gianni Versace,

1960
01:21:12,250 --> 01:21:13,240
可可·香奈兒
Coco Chanel,

1961
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:14,950
伊夫圣羅蘭
Yves Saint Laurent.

1962
01:21:15,410 --> 01:21:17,030
史蒂夫  過來一下
Steve, come over here for a second.

1963
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:19,290
你們可能沒有意識到
I don't think you all realize

1964
01:21:19,950 --> 01:21:21,330
史蒂夫·麥登
that Steve Madden

1965
01:21:21,660 --> 01:21:24,960
是女鞋界最炙手可熱的人物
is the hottest person in the women's shoe industry,

1966
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:26,330
北美的每一家百貨商場
with orders going through the roof

1967
01:21:26,420 --> 01:21:29,750
他的訂單都多到滿天飛
at every department store in North America right now.

1968
01:21:30,260 --> 01:21:32,260
我們竟有幸邀請他來辦公室
We have him here in our office!

1969
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:36,090
謝天謝地  他來了
We should thank our fucking lucky stars this man is here!

1970
01:21:36,180 --> 01:21:38,760
我們應該五體投地
We should be on our hands and knees right now,

1971
01:21:38,850 --> 01:21:40,930
給他跪舔
getting ready to suck this guy off!

1972
01:21:41,020 --> 01:21:43,560
像這樣  知道嗎
Like this! Okay?

1973
01:21:43,810 --> 01:21:45,440
我要跪舔你的雞雞  史蒂夫
I wanna suck you off, Steve!

1974
01:21:46,310 --> 01:21:47,900
大家都想給你跪舔
Everyone's gonna suck you off!

1975
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:49,770
這就是我們進入
This is our golden ticket

1976
01:21:49,980 --> 01:21:52,280
巧克力工廠的金獎券
to the fucking chocolate factory right here!

1977
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:54,320
我要的是
And I wanna meet

1978
01:21:54,490 --> 01:21:56,660
威利·旺卡那樣的魔法人物
Willy fucking Wonka, okay?

1979
01:21:57,320 --> 01:22:00,160
要像奧柏倫柏人那樣瘋狂一次
I wanna be with the fucking Oompa Loompas like this!

1980
01:22:04,250 --> 01:22:06,670
好了  下去吧  下去
All right, get off this fucking stage! Get out of here.

1981
01:22:07,210 --> 01:22:09,540
大家都聽好了
All right, I want all of you to focus for a second.

1982
01:22:10,090 --> 01:22:12,090
看到那些小黑盒子了嗎
See those little black boxes?

1983
01:22:12,340 --> 01:22:13,420
那叫電話
They're called telephones.

1984
01:22:13,510 --> 01:22:16,260
告訴你們一個關于電話的小秘密
I'm gonna let you in on a little secret about these telephones.

1985
01:22:16,340 --> 01:22:18,930
它們不會自己撥號  知道嗎
They're not gonna dial themselves. Okay?

1986
01:22:19,050 --> 01:22:22,770
沒有你們  它們只是快沒用的塑料
Without you, they're just worthless hunks of plastic.

1987
01:22:23,390 --> 01:22:24,830
就像上膛的M16
Like a loaded M16

1988
01:22:24,830 --> 01:22:26,980
卻沒有扣動扳機的士兵
without a trained Marine to pull the trigger.

1989
01:22:28,020 --> 01:22:30,440
而這些電話存在的意義
And in the case of the telephone,

1990
01:22:30,610 --> 01:22:33,230
就取決于在座的各位
it's up to each and every one of you,

1991
01:22:34,740 --> 01:22:36,820
我訓練有素的斯特拉頓人
my highly-trained Strattonites.

1992
01:22:37,950 --> 01:22:39,240
我的殺手們
My killers!

1993
01:22:39,990 --> 01:22:43,290
殺手們  不能接受否定的答案
My killers, who will not take no for an answer!

1994
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:45,750
我的戰士們
My fucking warriors,

1995
01:22:46,210 --> 01:22:48,210
決不輕易掛斷電話
who will not hang up the phone

1996
01:22:48,290 --> 01:22:51,290
直到客戶被拿下
until their client either buys

1997
01:22:51,380 --> 01:22:53,550
或者他媽死球
or fucking dies!

1998
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:10,100
讓我來告訴你們一件事
Let me tell you something.

1999
01:23:10,190 --> 01:23:13,190
沒錢是裝不了貴公子的
There is no nobility in poverty.

2000
01:23:13,650 --> 01:23:15,000
我可能成為一個富人
I have been a rich man

2001
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,650
也可能成為一個窮人
and I have been a poor man.

2002
01:23:16,740 --> 01:23:19,160
我每次都他媽選擇當富人
And I choose rich every fucking time.

2003
01:23:20,410 --> 01:23:21,470
因為作為一個富人
Because at least as a rich man,

2004
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:23,080
當我要面對什么問題時
when I have to face my problems,

2005
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:25,220
我起碼可以坐在加長豪車后座出場
I show up in the back of a limo,

2006
01:23:25,220 --> 01:23:27,000
穿著一身兩千美元的西服
wearing a $2,000 suit

2007
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:29,670
帶著四萬美元他媽一塊的金表
and a $40,000 gold fucking watch!

2008
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:35,000
打一架  揍他
Duke it out! Hit him!

2009
01:23:35,090 --> 01:23:36,510
從我身上他媽滾下來
Get the fuck off me!

2010
01:23:37,970 --> 01:23:42,140
假如這兒有任何人覺得我膚淺或者物質
And if anyone here thinks I'm superficial or materialistic,

2011
01:23:42,260 --> 01:23:44,510
那你去他媽的麥當勞找份工作吧
go get a job at fucking McDonald's,

2012
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:46,600
因為那里才是你他媽該去的地方
'cause that's where you fucking belong!

2013
01:23:48,730 --> 01:23:52,270
但在你離開這間滿是勝者的房間之前
But before you depart this room full of winners,

2014
01:23:53,070 --> 01:23:56,150
我希望你能好好看看你身邊的人  看吧
I want you to take a good look at the person next to you. Go on.

2015
01:23:57,150 --> 01:23:59,400
因為在不遠的將來
Because sometime in the not-so-distant future,

2016
01:23:59,820 --> 01:24:01,160
你會開著一輛破破爛爛的福特斑馬
you're gonna be pulling up to

2017
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:03,280
在紅燈前停下
a red light in your beat-up old fucking Pinto,

2018
01:24:03,620 --> 01:24:06,660
而那個人會開著一輛嶄新的保時捷
and that person's gonna be pulling up right alongside you

2019
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:08,870
停在你旁邊
in their brand new Porsche

2020
01:24:09,710 --> 01:24:11,710
身旁還坐著他們漂亮的
with their beautiful wife by their side,

2021
01:24:11,790 --> 01:24:13,790
有一對大奶子的妻子
who's got big voluptuous tits.

2022
01:24:15,460 --> 01:24:17,710
而你身邊會坐著誰呢
And who're you gonna be sitting next to?

2023
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:21,090
某頭惡心的角馬  滿嘴唇毛
Some disgusting wildebeest with three days of razor-stubble,

2024
01:24:21,180 --> 01:24:22,510
穿著件無袖長袍
in a sleeveless muumuu,

2025
01:24:22,590 --> 01:24:23,350
擠進你身邊
crammed in next to you

2026
01:24:23,350 --> 01:24:26,810
帶著一滿車從他媽折扣批發超市買的雜物
in a carload full of groceries from the fucking Price Club!

2027
01:24:26,890 --> 01:24:29,180
那就是將來坐在你身邊的人
That's who you're gonna be sitting next to!

2028
01:24:29,270 --> 01:24:31,520
所以你們聽我說  而且聽仔細了
So you listen to me and you listen well.

2029
01:24:31,650 --> 01:24:33,860
你是不是還有信用卡賬單沒付清
Are you behind on your credit card bills?

2030
01:24:34,270 --> 01:24:36,440
很好  拿起你們的電話然后開始撥號吧
Good! Pick up the phone and start dialing!

2031
01:24:36,860 --> 01:24:38,840
你的房東是不是準備趕你出門了
Is your landlord ready to evict you?

2032
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:41,860
很好  拿起你們的電話然后開始撥號吧
Good! Pick up the phone and start dialing!

2033
01:24:41,990 --> 01:24:45,240
你女朋友是否覺得你他媽就是個屌絲
Does your girlfriend think you're a fucking worthless loser?

2034
01:24:45,330 --> 01:24:48,370
很好  拿起你們的電話然后開始撥號吧
Good! Pick up the phone and start dialing!

2035
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:52,000
我希望你們能賺夠錢去解決這些問題
I want you to deal with your problems by becoming rich!

2036
01:24:54,170 --> 01:24:57,460
你們今天唯一需要做的就是拿起那臺電話
All you have to do today is pick up that phone

2037
01:24:58,670 --> 01:25:01,510
然后說出我教你們說的話
and speak the words that I have taught you.

2038
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:03,760
然后我就能讓你們變得
And I will make you richer

2039
01:25:03,890 --> 01:25:04,900
比美利堅他媽合眾國
than the most powerful

2040
01:25:04,900 --> 01:25:06,930
大部分有權有勢的CEO都富有
CEO in the United States of fucking America!

2041
01:25:07,010 --> 01:25:08,180
好
Yeah!

2042
01:25:09,350 --> 01:25:10,600
他媽的棒極了

01:30:36,010 --> 01:30:37,380
我知道我們是有點不正統
I know we're a little unorthodox,

2188
01:30:37,470 --> 01:30:39,180
我們做事有點大張旗鼓
we're a little loud in the way we do things.

2189
01:30:39,260 --> 01:30:40,390
但是你得理解
But you gotta understand,

2190
01:30:40,470 --> 01:30:41,930
我們是新入行的  你懂
we're the new guys on the block, you know,

2191
01:30:42,020 --> 01:30:44,140
我們在努力讓自己名揚萬里
we're trying to make a name for ourselves.

2192
01:30:44,230 --> 01:30:48,850
但我希望你明白  我們不做違法的事
But I want you to understand, we don't do anything illegal.

2193
01:30:49,650 --> 01:30:50,730
無論如何也不做
Whatsoever.

2194
01:30:50,820 --> 01:30:52,360
你可以去找證監會的人
I mean, you could talk to the SEC.

2195
01:30:52,440 --> 01:30:55,490
他們過去六個月來我辦公室拜訪了十五次
They were at my office 15 times over the last six months.

2196
01:30:55,570 --> 01:30:58,200
我是說  我沒...我沒什么要隱瞞的
I mean, I got... I got nothing to hide.

2197
01:30:58,280 --> 01:31:01,030
你知道證監會只是個民事管理機構
Well, you know the SEC is a civil regulatory agency.

2198
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:02,660
而我們查的是犯罪活動
We pursue criminal activities.

2199
01:31:02,740 --> 01:31:05,580
正是這樣  你要查的是真正的犯罪
Exactly! You go after real criminals,

2200
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:09,210
這讓我很好奇你們為什么會調查我
which makes me wonder what the hell you're investigating me for?

2201
01:31:09,330 --> 01:31:10,670
我是說  說實話...
I mean, honestly...

2202
01:31:10,750 --> 01:31:13,540
你覺得我們做過什么或者在做什么嗎
what is it that you think that we did or do?

2203
01:31:13,540 --> 01:31:14,590
我不明白
I don't get it.

2204
01:31:14,710 --> 01:31:15,970
我...
Well, I...

2205
01:31:16,050 --> 01:31:18,470
喬丹  我不能討論正在進行的調查
Look, Jordan, I can't discuss an ongoing investigation.

2206
01:31:18,550 --> 01:31:20,220
沒事  我明白  沒事的  我理解
No, I get that. No, I understand.

2207
01:31:20,350 --> 01:31:21,720
雖然這么說
With that said...

2208
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:24,430
其實這案子是被扔在我桌上的
this case got dumped on my desk...

2209
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:26,350
-是這樣嗎  -你懂的  高層
- Did it? - You know, by a higher-up

2210
01:31:26,430 --> 01:31:27,550
那些想要作秀的人
who needs to make a show

2211
01:31:27,550 --> 01:31:29,650
得借著追查一家新公司為由
of looking into the new company on the block,

2212
01:31:29,730 --> 01:31:31,190
-拉上一堆媒體之類的  -新上位那些
- with all the press and everything. - New loud guys.

2213
01:31:31,310 --> 01:31:33,930
然后我就變成了來做調查的蠢貨
And then I end up being the schmuck who does the looking.

2214
01:31:33,940 --> 01:31:34,860
就是這樣
Exactly.

2215
01:31:34,940 --> 01:31:36,860
只是  你懂的...這東西很煩
It's just, you know... it bothers me.

2216
01:31:36,950 --> 01:31:37,580
我們是新人
We're the new guy.

2217
01:31:37,580 --> 01:31:39,490
我們是去敲華爾街的門的人
We're the one that's banging on Wall Street's door.

2218
01:31:39,570 --> 01:31:40,660
我的意思是  你應該...
I mean, you should...

2219
01:31:40,740 --> 01:31:42,660
你應該去查查那些大投行在干什么
You should see what's going on at the bigger firms.

2220
01:31:42,740 --> 01:31:44,200
我說  我知道所有的內幕
I mean, I know all the information.

2221
01:31:44,370 --> 01:31:47,160
是真的  高盛  雷曼兄弟  美林
It's true! Goldman, Lehman Brothers, Merrill...

2222
01:31:44,370 --> 01:31:47,160
{\an8}均為美國大投行

2223
01:31:47,250 --> 01:31:49,250
擔保債務憑證
Collateralized debt obligations?

2224
01:31:49,370 --> 01:31:50,620
還有什么互聯網概念股
This Internet stock bullshit?

2225
01:31:50,710 --> 01:31:52,500
簡直就是他媽的放屁
I mean, it's a fucking travesty.

2226
01:31:52,590 --> 01:31:54,830
我能手把手地告訴你
I could take you step-by-step

2227
01:31:54,830 --> 01:31:57,590
他們每一步都在做什么
through what exactly is occurring.

2228
01:31:57,840 --> 01:31:59,430
你只需要開口問
All you have to do is ask.

2229
01:31:59,590 --> 01:32:00,890
我隨時恭候
I'm available.

2230
01:32:01,050 --> 01:32:02,430
我就等你這句話了
That's exactly what I wanted to hear.

2231
01:32:02,510 --> 01:32:05,390
我不明白像這樣的談話
I don't see why a little sitdown like this

2232
01:32:06,270 --> 01:32:07,810
怎么就不能對我們雙方都有利了
can't be profitable for the both of us.

2233
01:32:07,930 --> 01:32:08,910
本來就應該這樣  是吧
It should. Right?

2234
01:32:08,910 --> 01:32:10,190
這本來就該對我們雙方都有利
It should profit the both of us.

2235
01:32:10,270 --> 01:32:11,770
-是應該這樣  -聽著
- It should. - Look.

2236
01:32:12,310 --> 01:32:14,520
我會給你我的私人號碼
I'm gonna give you my personal line.

2237
01:32:14,610 --> 01:32:17,530
工作日里隨時可以打電話給我
Five days a week, you just call me, feel free.

2238
01:32:17,740 --> 01:32:19,450
-我會的  -棒極了
- I'll do that. - Great.

2239
01:32:22,030 --> 01:32:23,700
你們確定不喝點什么
Are you sure you guys don't want something to drink?

2240
01:32:23,780 --> 01:32:25,450
你們不餓嗎  什么也不要
You're not hungry? Nothing?

2241
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:27,160
-什么都不要嗎  不要嗎  -不用了
- Nothing? No? - Oh, no.

2242
01:32:30,290 --> 01:32:31,190
讓我問你幾個問題
Let me ask you,

2243
01:32:31,190 --> 01:32:32,880
假如你不想透露太多個人信息
and if you don't wanna get too personal,

2244
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:35,250
你可以隨時叫我閉嘴
just tell me to shut up at any time.

2245
01:32:36,130 --> 01:32:38,760
你是不是曾經考慮過弄個經紀人執照
Did you try to get your broker's license at one time?

2246
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:39,760
我不知道自己有沒有聽錯
Did I hear that right?

2247
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:41,680
你是不是也曾想來華爾街分一杯羹
Were you trying to take a stab at Wall Street?

2248
01:32:42,590 --> 01:32:44,510
-沒有嗎  -你和誰談過話
- No? - Who you been talking to?

2249
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:45,600
你他媽和誰談過了
Who the fuck you been talking to?

2250
01:32:45,680 --> 01:32:48,430
你在調查我  我也聽了你的事跡
Well, you're investigating me. I hear things.

2251
01:32:48,520 --> 01:32:50,600
你懂我意思吧
You know what I mean?

2252
01:32:50,690 --> 01:32:52,270
你有沒有想過假如你堅持下去了
You ever think about what would've happened

2253
01:32:52,350 --> 01:32:54,810
會發生什么
if you would have stayed the course?

2254
01:32:56,230 --> 01:32:58,070
你知道嗎  每當我搭地鐵回家
You know what? When I'm riding home on the subway

2255
01:32:58,150 --> 01:32:59,400
蛋蛋都他媽汗濕了
and my balls are fucking sweating,

2256
01:32:59,490 --> 01:33:01,280
一套西服連續穿了三天...
I'm wearing the same suit three days in a row...

2257
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:02,860
沒錯  我當然想過
Yeah, you bet I do.

2258
01:33:02,950 --> 01:33:04,620
我以前就想過這個  誰不想呢  是吧
I've thought about it before. Who wouldn't, right?

2259
01:33:04,700 --> 01:33:05,740
沒錯  誰他媽會不想呢
Right, who fucking wouldn't?

2260
01:33:05,830 --> 01:33:06,990
你是怎么...
What do you get...

2261
01:33:07,080 --> 01:33:08,330
又是一個私人為題  你不用回答
Another personal question, no need to answer...

2262
01:33:08,410 --> 01:33:09,790
沒事  沒關系的  喬丹
No, that's all right, Jordan.

2263
01:33:09,870 --> 01:33:12,920
你能賺多少啊  五六萬之類的
What do you pull in? 50, 60K? Something like that?

2264
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:15,040
一年嗎  大約
A year? In the ballpark?

2265
01:33:15,130 --> 01:33:16,590
我...
Well, I...

2266
01:33:16,670 --> 01:33:18,460
這樣說吧
Let's put it this way.

2267
01:33:18,550 --> 01:33:21,340
局里至少能給你一把免費的槍
You get a free handgun when you sign up for the Bureau.

2268
01:33:22,090 --> 01:33:24,220
這他媽讓我很生氣啊  你懂我意思嗎
No, but it fucking pisses me off. You know what I mean?

2269
01:33:24,300 --> 01:33:26,470
你想想  那些建設了這個國家的人
You think about the people that built this country,

2270
01:33:26,550 --> 01:33:27,970
像你一樣勤勤懇懇的人
hardworking people like you.

2271
01:33:28,060 --> 01:33:30,600
消防員  老師  聯邦探員
Firefighters, teachers, FBI agents.

2272
01:33:30,730 --> 01:33:31,340
結果到最后
End of the day,

2273
01:33:31,340 --> 01:33:34,400
你們這群人在經濟上被生吞活剝了
you guys get fucking skinned alive financially.

2274
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:36,360
這他媽讓我太生氣了
It fucking makes me angry.

2275
01:33:36,440 --> 01:33:39,530
如今  關于華爾街和這個市場
Now the one thing about Wall Street and this market is,

2276
01:33:39,610 --> 01:33:41,280
在我看來  我覺得
for me, I feel

2277
01:33:42,360 --> 01:33:44,700
能回饋社會是好事  你知道  有些
it's good to give back. You know, there's...

2278
01:33:44,780 --> 01:33:46,950
有些情況下我能
There are situations where I can

2279
01:33:47,030 --> 01:33:50,580
讓這些人處境好點  明白嗎
make those situations better for people. You know?

2280
01:33:50,660 --> 01:33:51,950
你懂我意思的
You know what I mean.

2281
01:33:52,040 --> 01:33:53,460
機遇
Opportunity

2282
01:33:53,750 --> 01:33:55,000
就是一切
is everything.

2283
01:33:55,080 --> 01:33:56,330
太對了
Exactly.

2284
01:33:56,460 --> 01:33:58,920
舉個例子  有這么個小孩  是吧
Take for example, I got this one kid, right?

2285
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:02,800
去學校學環境科學之類的
Went to school for environmental science, something like that.

2286
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:04,680
但卻被學生貸款困住了
He was bogged down by student loans.

2287
01:34:04,760 --> 01:34:07,470
然后他媽又要做三重心臟搭橋手術
Turns out, his mother needed triple bypass surgery.

2288
01:34:07,550 --> 01:34:08,970
-天吶  -沒錯  很慘
- Jesus. - Right. Horrible situation.

2289
01:34:09,060 --> 01:34:10,010
是啊
Sure.

2290
01:34:10,100 --> 01:34:11,180
但是我們在正確的時候
But we got him into the market

2291
01:34:11,270 --> 01:34:12,980
拉他入市  再選一只正確的股票
at the right time and chose the right stock.

2292
01:34:13,060 --> 01:34:14,810
我們給予他正確的指導
We gave him the right guidance.

2293
01:34:14,890 --> 01:34:18,060
轟  一夜之間  就改變了他整個人生
Boom! Overnight, changed his entire life.

2294
01:34:18,190 --> 01:34:21,530
他媽被送進了紐約最好的醫院
Got to put his mother into the best hospital in New York City.

2295
01:34:21,610 --> 01:34:22,770
但還是沒用
It didn't work out for her,

2296
01:34:22,770 --> 01:34:24,490
假設  她還是去世了  很不幸
granted, she passed away, unfortunately.

2297
01:34:24,570 --> 01:34:26,490
但我們至少給了他那個機會
But we gave him that opportunity.

2298
01:34:26,570 --> 01:34:27,740
你懂我在說什么嗎
You know what I'm saying?

2299
01:34:28,450 --> 01:34:30,760
這取決于建立一個好團隊
It's just about setting up the right team,

2300
01:34:30,760 --> 01:34:32,950
然后一夜之間你的人生將得以改變
and then overnight your life can change.

2301
01:34:38,340 --> 01:34:40,750
一個實習生能...能...
What does... What does an intern...

2302
01:34:42,300 --> 01:34:44,170
一個實習生做這樣一單能賺多少
What does an intern make in a deal like that?

2303
01:34:44,260 --> 01:34:46,300
在那種情況下
Well, in that situation,

2304
01:34:47,220 --> 01:34:50,260
在那筆特定的交易里  就那一筆
in that particular trade, and it was one trade,

2305
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:53,100
五十多萬美元吧
north of half a million dollars.

2306
01:34:56,730 --> 01:34:58,980
而且我會為任何人做這件事  明白嗎
And I'd do that for anybody, you know,

2307
01:34:59,060 --> 01:35:01,730
任何需要適當的指導的人
anybody that needs the proper guidance.

2308
01:35:21,540 --> 01:35:25,630
能再說一遍嗎  就把剛剛說的再說一遍
Can you say that again, just the way you said it?

2309
01:35:26,050 --> 01:35:27,760
一模一樣的
Just the same way.

2310
01:35:31,970 --> 01:35:33,060
我不懂你在說什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

2311
01:35:33,140 --> 01:35:35,390
算了吧  你當然懂我在說什么
Oh, come on! You know what I'm talking about.

2312
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:37,480
我覺得剛剛喬丹在干的事是...
I think what Jordan just did is he...

2313
01:35:37,560 --> 01:35:38,690
-假如我沒弄錯的話...  -不是
- If I'm not mistaken... - No.

2314
01:35:38,770 --> 01:35:40,900
你剛剛在試圖賄賂一個聯邦官員
...you just tried to bribe a federal officer.

2315
01:35:40,980 --> 01:35:43,070
沒有  理論上我沒有賄賂任何人
No, technically I didn't bribe anybody.

2316
01:35:43,150 --> 01:35:45,570
不不  我聽到的可不是這樣的  喬丹
No, no, that's not the conversation I heard, Jordan.

2317
01:35:45,650 --> 01:35:47,150
不不  根據美國刑法
No, no, according to the U.S. criminal code,

2318
01:35:47,240 --> 01:35:48,530
賄賂必須有個
there needs to be an exact

2319
01:35:48,530 --> 01:35:50,660
確切的金額
dollar figure for the exchange of services.

2320
01:35:50,740 --> 01:35:52,370
那個在法庭上站不住腳的
That would not hold up in a court of law.

2321
01:35:52,450 --> 01:35:54,120
不不  我聽見的可不是這么回事
Nah, it's not how I heard it.

2322
01:35:54,200 --> 01:35:55,620
不不不  事實就是如此
No, no, no, that's the truth.

2323
01:35:55,620 --> 01:35:56,910
但我想告訴你這個
But I want to tell you this.

2324
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:58,000
你說
Yeah.

2325
01:35:58,080 --> 01:35:59,580
那個告訴我你曾經試過
The same gentleman that told me

2326
01:35:59,670 --> 01:36:01,420
考經紀人執照的人
that you tried to get your broker's license

2327
01:36:01,500 --> 01:36:03,630
也和我說過你是個規矩正直的人
also told me that you are a straight arrow.

2328
01:36:03,750 --> 01:36:05,210
他把我仔細調查了一番
He ran a security check on me.

2329
01:36:05,300 --> 01:36:06,510
這個嘛...
Well...

2330
01:36:06,630 --> 01:36:08,380
沒錯  假如你駕著一艘
Yeah, when you sail on a boat

2331
01:36:08,380 --> 01:36:09,590
像是邦德電影里反派開的船
fit for a Bond villain,

2332
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:12,340
那有時你就得扮扮"惡人"   是吧
sometimes you need to play the part. Right?

2333
01:36:13,140 --> 01:36:15,060
我覺得你倆是時候滾下我的船了
I think it's time you both get the fuck off my boat.

2334
01:36:15,180 --> 01:36:16,430
你說什么
What do you say?

2335
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:18,770
你知道嗎  喬丹  我告訴你一件事
You know, Jordan, I'll tell you something.

2336
01:36:18,850 --> 01:36:21,850
大部分我逮捕的華爾街混蛋
Most of the Wall Street jackasses that I bust,

2337
01:36:22,270 --> 01:36:24,610
他們都是天生如此
they're to the manor born.

2338
01:36:24,690 --> 01:36:25,770
-是嗎  -沒錯
- Is that right? - Yeah.

2339
01:36:25,860 --> 01:36:27,480
他們老爹是混蛋
Their fathers are douchebags,

2340
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:29,490
老爹的老爹也是
just like their fathers before them.

2341
01:36:30,610 --> 01:36:32,030
但你不一樣
But you...

2342
01:36:33,740 --> 01:36:36,030
喬丹  你全是自己打拼出來的
You, Jordan, you got this way all on your own.

2343
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:37,370
是嗎
Did I?

2344
01:36:37,450 --> 01:36:39,540
-佩服佩服  小伙子  -小伙子
- Good for you, little man. - Little man?

2345
01:36:39,660 --> 01:36:40,910
真心佩服
Good for you.

2346
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:42,170
你居然叫我小伙子
Me, the little man?

2347
01:36:42,250 --> 01:36:43,290
而且我跟你說
And let me tell you something.

2348
01:36:43,380 --> 01:36:45,210
我跟你說點別的
Let me tell you something else.

2349
01:36:45,340 --> 01:36:47,500
老實說  我沒跟你開玩笑啊
Honestly, I'm not bullshitting here,

2350
01:36:47,670 --> 01:36:48,800
這艘船可說是我登上過的
this is one of the nicest boats

2351
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:50,880
-最好的船了  真心話  -我看也是
- that I've ever been on, I gotta tell you. - I bet it is.

2352
01:36:50,970 --> 01:36:52,380
你知道我還怎么想的嗎
And you know what I was just thinking, too?

2353
01:36:52,510 --> 01:36:55,760
如果哪天局里派人封了這艘船
The fucking hero that I'm gonna be back at the office

2354
01:36:55,890 --> 01:36:58,060
那我他媽肯定就是大英雄
when the Bureau seizes this fucking boat.

2355
01:36:58,180 --> 01:37:00,350
你他媽說是不是這樣  喬丹
Because, I mean, fuckety-fuck-fuck, Jordan,

2356
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:01,730
瞧瞧這艘船
look at this thing!

2357
01:37:02,100 --> 01:37:03,150
多漂亮
It's beautiful!

2358
01:37:03,230 --> 01:37:06,190
而且你船上還有美妞兒  多好
And you got the beautiful girls there. It's wonderful.

2359
01:37:06,270 --> 01:37:08,730
挺好  快他媽給我滾
All right, get the fuck off my boat.

2360
01:37:08,900 --> 01:37:10,440
我想我們很快就會
I'm sure we'll be seeing each other

2361
01:37:10,530 --> 01:37:11,570
-再見面的  -我同意
- real soon. - I'm sure.

2362
01:37:11,650 --> 01:37:12,810
祝你們坐破地鐵
Good luck on that subway

2363
01:37:12,810 --> 01:37:15,120
回家干你們臭婆娘的路上一路順風
ride home to your miserable, ugly fucking wives.

2364
01:37:15,200 --> 01:37:16,370
我則要讓海蒂
I'm gonna have Heidi lick

2365
01:37:16,370 --> 01:37:18,290
就著魚子醬舔我的蛋
some caviar off my balls in the meantime.

2366
01:37:18,410 --> 01:37:21,040
你兩個想不想帶些龍蝦回家
Hey, you guys want to take some lobsters for your ride home?

2367
01:37:21,120 --> 01:37:23,750
一群混蛋  諒你們也吃不起
Fucking miserable pricks, I know you can't afford them!

2368
01:37:23,830 --> 01:37:25,920
一群賤貨
Fucking cheap fucks.

2369
01:37:26,090 --> 01:37:28,050
混蛋
Fucking miserable pricks.

2370
01:37:28,130 --> 01:37:31,340
兩位  看看我掏兜的時候找著了啥
Hey, fellas! Look what I found in my pocket! Look!

2371
01:37:31,630 --> 01:37:33,380
把你們一年的工資都掏出來了
A year's salary right here.

2372
01:37:33,470 --> 01:37:36,140
你知道我管這叫什么嗎  優惠券
You know what I call them? Fun coupons!

2373
01:37:36,220 --> 01:37:37,470
看見了嗎
See that!

2374
01:37:38,010 --> 01:37:40,020
我都嫌多的優惠券
They're fun coupons!

2375
01:37:47,820 --> 01:37:50,570
瑞士  瑞士有什么好逛的
Switzerland? What the fuck is in Switzerland?

2376
01:37:50,690 --> 01:37:52,690
當然是去逛瑞士銀行
Swiss fucking banks, that's what.

2377
01:37:52,780 --> 01:37:55,450
現在得遮遮丑  我必須得把錢藏起來
It was ass-covering time. I had to hide my money.

2378
01:37:56,740 --> 01:37:58,280
因特·魯格拉特
Enter Rugrat.

2379
01:37:58,410 --> 01:38:00,040
他是在法學院里認識這個瑞士銀行家的
He knew this Swiss banker from law school.

2380
01:38:00,120 --> 01:38:01,160
這是干歐洲娘們用的
That's for European pussy!

2381
01:38:01,250 --> 01:38:02,500
但他人在日內瓦
But he was in Geneva.

2382
01:38:02,580 --> 01:38:04,960
所以這趟長途飛機  我肯定要嗨著過去
And there was no way I was gonna make that flight sober.

2383
01:38:06,790 --> 01:38:08,420
我知道我只需適當的藥量
So I knew if I took my drugs right,

2384
01:38:08,500 --> 01:38:10,550
就能睡完整個旅程
I could sleep through the entire flight.

2385
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:13,300
但必須要按時按量
But I had to take them just right.

2386
01:38:13,930 --> 01:38:15,970
下午四點整  我又吃了幾片
At 4:00 P.M., I popped a few more ludes,

2387
01:38:16,050 --> 01:38:17,510
這樣等我開完銷售會議
which started kicking in by the time

2388
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:19,350
藥勁正好上來
I finished my sales meeting.

2389
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:20,810
這是手腳刺癢階段
My tingle phase.

2390
01:38:21,140 --> 01:38:22,810
到晚餐時  我再吃幾片
By dinner, I popped a few more

2391
01:38:22,890 --> 01:38:25,810
就著幾杯雞尾酒和一兩片安定
on top of some cocktails and a Valium or two.

2392
01:38:25,980 --> 01:38:27,480
這是口齒不清階段
My slur phase.

2393
01:38:29,650 --> 01:38:31,980
到八點半  我再多吃幾片
By 8:30, I took a few more ludes

2394
01:38:32,190 --> 01:38:34,780
這時我差不多就走不動道了
and pretty much lost all my motor skills.

2395
01:38:35,030 --> 01:38:36,530
這是口水橫流階段
This was the drool phase.

2396
01:38:39,580 --> 01:38:42,950
到十點  我就完全不知道我是誰了
By 10:00, I didn't know who or what the fuck I was.

2397
01:38:43,040 --> 01:38:44,620
這是記憶喪失階段
The amnesia phase.

2398
01:38:45,540 --> 01:38:47,500
我們在午夜之前登機
We boarded the plane just before midnight.

2399
01:38:47,580 --> 01:38:49,290
媽呀  瞧瞧
Wow! Look at you!

2400
01:38:49,380 --> 01:38:51,340
-好個美人兒  -請別這樣  先生
- You're beautiful. - Excuse me, sir.

2401
01:38:51,550 --> 01:38:53,710
他安眠藥的藥勁上來了  他沒事的
His sleeping pills just kicked in. He's all right.

2402
01:38:53,800 --> 01:38:55,340
能出示一下登機牌嗎  先生
May I see your boarding passes, sir?

2403
01:38:55,430 --> 01:38:57,180
我們當然有登機牌
We have the boarding passes.

2404
01:38:57,300 --> 01:38:59,300
向老天發誓  我真想干她
Jesus Christ, I wanna fuck her.

2405
01:38:59,930 --> 01:39:01,640
干嘛呢  輕點
Hey! Fucking relax.

2406
01:39:01,850 --> 01:39:03,890
老天  快把你的爪子從我的老二上拿開
Oh, my God! You got your hand on my fucking cock!

2407
01:39:03,980 --> 01:39:05,350
別鬧了
Cut it out.

2408
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:06,440
你看他還到處亂摸
He's got his hand on my dick again.

2409
01:39:06,520 --> 01:39:07,520
我這是給你系安全帶
I'm just trying to buckle you up.

2410
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:08,810
你摸著他老二了嗎
You got your hand on his dick?

2411
01:39:08,900 --> 01:39:10,860
大庭廣眾的可控制著點啊
You gotta stop doing that in public places.

2412
01:39:10,940 --> 01:39:12,900
我的天  放手
Oh, my God. Take it off!

2413
01:39:13,190 --> 01:39:14,190
快放手
Take it off!

2414
01:39:14,280 --> 01:39:16,990
我聽說你頭發里有藏寶圖呢
I heard there's a treasure map under here.

2415
01:39:17,110 --> 01:39:18,380
住手
Stop!

2416
01:39:18,390 --> 01:39:19,660
-抱歉  先生  -我知道  女士

2417
01:39:19,740 --> 01:39:21,240
請您坐下
Please sit down.

2418
01:39:21,330 --> 01:39:22,780
-管好他  -請做回您的座位去
- Watch it. - Go back to your seat, please.

2419
01:39:22,870 --> 01:39:25,160
-你不高興個什么勁啊  -請您坐回去
- What are you upset about? - Please go back to your seat.

2420
01:39:25,250 --> 01:39:27,120
否則我要通知機長了
I will have to call the captain.

2421
01:39:27,210 --> 01:39:29,710
先生  請您坐回去
Please, sir, please, sir. Sit down.

2422
01:39:29,790 --> 01:39:31,460
坐回去
Please sit down!

2423
01:39:31,540 --> 01:39:33,130
-我這就去  別說了  -抱歉

2424
01:39:33,210 --> 01:39:34,840
我們抱歉  我們這就睡覺去
We apologize. We're gonna go to sleep.

2425
01:39:34,920 --> 01:39:36,130
提問  我要求提問
Question. I wanna ask you a question.

2426
01:39:36,220 --> 01:39:37,760
系好您的安全帶  先生
Fasten your seat belt, sir.

2427
01:39:38,380 --> 01:39:39,930
您不系好安全帶我們就
We cannot take off if you haven't fastened

2428
01:39:40,010 --> 01:39:41,050
-沒法起飛  -我真想爽一發啊

- What? - I'll do it for you.

2432
01:39:45,020 --> 01:39:46,180
說人話啊  姑娘
You gotta speak English.

2433
01:39:46,270 --> 01:39:48,230
您這異域風情的口音我們聽不懂
We don't understand this language you're speaking.

2434
01:39:48,310 --> 01:39:49,810
我要幫他系上安全帶
I will help him with his seat belt.

唐尼  這不好玩  快給我解開
Donnie, this isn't funny. You gotta untie me, buddy.

2443
01:40:24,140 --> 01:40:25,850
不行啊
I can't untie you.

2444
01:40:25,930 --> 01:40:28,770
機長綁的你  再不然他就要用電棍了
The captain tied you up. He almost fucking tasered you.

2445
01:40:29,730 --> 01:40:32,150
為什么
Why?

2446
01:40:41,110 --> 01:40:42,910
不怪你  親愛的  別怪你自己
it's not you, sweetheart, don't beat yourself up.

2447
01:40:43,200 --> 01:40:45,950
別緊張  他沒事  他只是怕坐飛機
Easy, easy. He's fine. He's just a nervous flyer.

2448
01:40:46,120 --> 01:40:48,290
你沖別人大喊大叫
You were screaming at people.

2449
01:40:48,370 --> 01:40:49,750
不是吧
Oh, fuck off.

2450
01:40:49,830 --> 01:40:51,960
你在地板上滿地打滾
You were on the floor rolling around and shit.

2451
01:40:52,040 --> 01:40:53,080
我的天
Oh, Jesus.

2452
01:40:53,170 --> 01:40:55,250
你管機長叫什么奴
You called the captain the N-word.

2453
01:40:55,340 --> 01:40:56,840
我這么叫他了嗎
I called the captain the N-word?

2454
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:59,170
-他非常不高興  -是嗎
- Yeah, he was very upset. - Really?

2455
01:40:59,300 --> 01:41:01,630
-還好我們在頭等艙  -我的天
- Luckily we're in first class. - Jesus.

2456
01:41:02,470 --> 01:41:05,300
我說你是不是嗑藥上癮了
Jesus Christ, I think you have a fucking drug problem.

2457
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:09,020
藥在哪  到底在哪
Where are the ludes? Where are the ludes?

2458
01:41:10,060 --> 01:41:11,560
我藏得好好的  別緊張
They're up my ass. Don't worry about it.

2459
01:41:11,640 --> 01:41:13,230
-都弄好了  -那就好
- I got it. - Okay.

2460
01:41:13,310 --> 01:41:14,900
那就好
Thank God.

2461
01:41:15,360 --> 01:41:16,260
我的天  等我們
Jesus Christ, what are we

2463
01:41:17,940 --> 01:41:18,940
大事不妙了
This is bad.

2464
01:41:19,030 --> 01:41:21,360
這破玩意兒綁這么緊  我喘不過氣來了
Fucking things are against my chest. I can't breathe.

2465
01:41:21,490 --> 01:41:23,240
幫幫忙  撫慰撫慰我  求你了
Come on, do something to calm me down. Please.

01:41:28,330 --> 01:41:29,580
-真舒服  -睡吧睡吧
- That's good. - Go to sleep.

2469
01:41:29,660 --> 01:41:30,790
使點勁  哥們
Rub it harder, buddy.

2470
01:41:30,910 --> 01:41:32,500
你是好寶貝
You're all right.

01:41:32,870 --> 01:41:35,170
我們都愛你  閉上嘴
We all love you. Shut the fuck up!

2472
01:41:41,010 --> 01:41:43,880
貝爾福先生  你可以走了
Mr. Belfort, you're free to go.

2473
01:41:46,010 --> 01:41:47,180
真的嗎
Really?

2474
01:41:51,230 --> 01:41:52,350
-跟你說  唐尼  -咋了
- Hey, Donnie. - Yeah?

2475
01:41:52,440 --> 01:41:53,940
等我們到了那邊  你注意點你自己
When we get out there, try not to act like yourself.

2476
01:41:54,020 --> 01:41:56,310
到了日內瓦就別混犯渾了  可以嗎
Okay? Let's make Geneva an asshole-free Donnie zone, all right?

2477
01:41:56,400 --> 01:41:57,810
你沖著我來干什么
What are you fucking coming at me for?

2478
01:41:57,900 --> 01:41:59,440
聽著  你現在坐在加長豪車而不是
Hey, listen. The only reason you're sitting in this limo

2479
01:41:59,530 --> 01:42:01,110
瑞士監獄里必須感謝我朋友  懂嗎
and not in a Swiss jail is because of my friend. Okay?

2480
01:42:01,190 --> 01:42:02,360
幫個忙
Hilfe!

2481
01:42:03,320 --> 01:42:05,740
-到了到了  -大家伙穩著點
- We're here. We're here. - Everyone calm down.

2482
01:42:06,240 --> 01:42:07,660
喬丹·貝爾福
Jordan Belfort!

2483
01:42:07,740 --> 01:42:08,990
您終于來了
At last.

2484
01:42:09,080 --> 01:42:11,660
我從尼古拉斯那聽到了您的許多壯舉
Nicholas has told me so much about you.

2485
01:42:11,750 --> 01:42:13,620
喬丹  這位是簡·雅克·索雷爾
Jordan, Jean Jacques Saurel.

2486
01:42:13,870 --> 01:42:16,250
-很高興認識您  -幸會幸會
- Pleasure to make your acquaintance. - Nice to meet you.

2487
01:42:16,830 --> 01:42:18,040
您說笑了
It's a joke.

2488
01:42:18,170 --> 01:42:20,420
你只要坐一坐就知道是什么感覺了
You'll understand when you're in the fucking seat.

2489
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:22,380
你需要大點的沙發  待客用的
You need a bigger couch. For guests.

2490
01:42:22,470 --> 01:42:24,170
哈哈  哈哈  我還是沒懂  抱歉
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I don't understand. I'm sorry.

2491
01:42:24,260 --> 01:42:27,090
我對你們國家的銀行保密法很感興趣
I'm curious about your bank secrecy laws here.

2492
01:42:28,720 --> 01:42:31,890
等下  那個  抱歉喬丹
Wait. Yes. Excusez-moi, Jordan.

2493
01:42:32,480 --> 01:42:35,520
瑞士人待客總是得先來十分鐘
Swiss custom requires 10 minutes of...

2494
01:42:35,650 --> 01:42:36,650
這個那個的
Blah, blah, blah.

2495
01:42:36,730 --> 01:42:38,360
-閑聊  -對就是閑聊  多謝
- Chit chat. - Yeah, chit chat, thank you.

2496
01:42:38,440 --> 01:42:40,070
然后再談正事
...before business can be discussed.

2497
01:42:41,610 --> 01:42:42,730
是吧
Yeah.

2498
01:42:45,530 --> 01:42:46,570
那好
Of course.

2499
01:42:47,240 --> 01:42:50,030
那咱們就說正事  您想了解些什么
Let's get down to it. What would you like to know?

2500
01:42:50,580 --> 01:42:53,450
在什么情況下  你們有義務
Under what circumstances would you be obligated

2501
01:42:53,540 --> 01:42:55,710
和聯邦調查局
to cooperate with an FBI

2502
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:59,170
或者美國司法部之類的部門合作
or a U.S. Justice Department investigation, for example?

2503
01:42:59,790 --> 01:43:00,960
看情況
Ca depend.

2504
01:43:01,590 --> 01:43:02,710
還得看情況
Ca depend?

2505
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:03,800
沒錯
Oui.

2506
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:07,550
具體看什么情況
Ca depend on what, exactly?

2507
01:43:08,340 --> 01:43:10,600
看美國人接下來幾個月會不會
Whether America plans to invade Switzerland

2508
01:43:10,680 --> 01:43:12,260
占領瑞士
in the coming months.

2509
01:43:12,720 --> 01:43:14,930
要不要我去看看十字架上有沒有跑坦克
Shall I check if tanks are rolling down the Rue de la Croy?

2510
01:43:15,020 --> 01:43:17,100
-那是十字街  -對對  十字街
- Yes. Rue de la Croix. - Croix. Croix.

2511
01:43:17,190 --> 01:43:20,020
是街不是架  還"十字架"  是街啦
Not Croy. Not Rue de la Croy. It's Croix.

2512
01:43:20,230 --> 01:43:22,440
我們在法學院常玩這個來著  不信你看
See, this is what he used to do back in law school. Check me.

2513
01:43:22,530 --> 01:43:24,280
-是香檳還是香崩  -沒錯
- Champagne. Champagne. - Yeah.

2514
01:43:24,360 --> 01:43:26,740
沒錯  還有炸薯條和炸洋芋
Yeah, yeah. French fries, pommes frites.

2515
01:43:27,490 --> 01:43:30,030
-總之這類的  -逗出鳥來了
- And that kind of stuff. - That's funny.

2516
01:43:31,450 --> 01:43:33,930
我問的是  你這瑞士廢柴
What I'm asking, you Swiss dick,

2517
01:43:33,940 --> 01:43:36,500
你會不會事后坑我
is are you going to fuck me over?

2518
01:43:39,130 --> 01:43:42,790
我當然聽明白了  你個美國白癡
I understand perfectly, you American shit.

2519
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:47,340
外國司法部門能夠獲得
The only way the Banque Real de Geneve

2520
01:43:47,430 --> 01:43:49,510
日內瓦銀行合作的唯一情況
would cooperate with a foreign legal body

2521
01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:53,760
就是他們指控的罪名在瑞士也同樣違法
is if the crime being pursued is also a crime in Switzerland.

2522
01:43:53,890 --> 01:43:58,440
但只有很少的瑞士法律涉及您從事的業務
But there are very few Swiss laws which apply to your practices.

2523
01:43:59,650 --> 01:44:01,270
從金融角度講
From a financial standpoint,

2524
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:04,440
您現在身處天堂了
you are now in heaven.

2525
01:44:04,610 --> 01:44:06,480
我就說他很厲害吧
See, I told you he was fantastic, right?

2526
01:44:07,240 --> 01:44:08,560
如果美國司法部
If the U.S. Justice

2527
01:44:08,570 --> 01:44:11,780
發傳票給我們  我們會只當它
Department sent us a subpoena, it would become

2528
01:44:12,240 --> 01:44:13,870
是廁紙
papier toilette.

2529
01:44:14,740 --> 01:44:17,000
擦屁股用的
We would wipe our ass with it.

2530
01:44:17,660 --> 01:44:20,250
當然  除非他們是要調查
Unless, of course, it was an investigation

2531
01:44:20,330 --> 01:44:22,170
股票詐騙
into stock fraud,

2532
01:44:22,250 --> 01:44:24,420
我沒記錯的話  這在你們瑞士也是犯罪
which is a crime here in Switzerland, if I'm correct.

2533
01:44:24,500 --> 01:44:28,510
這樣的話你們將有義務與他們合作
Then there would have to be cooperation on your part,

2534
01:44:28,630 --> 01:44:30,590
-如果我沒說錯的話  -當然
- if I'm not mistaken. - Yes.

2535
01:44:30,760 --> 01:44:33,180
當然會合作
Yes, we would.

2536
01:44:33,350 --> 01:44:35,890
如果賬戶是在你名下的話
Assuming the account is under your name.

2537
01:44:37,100 --> 01:44:40,140
但如果不是你的名字
If it were another name,

2538
01:44:41,350 --> 01:44:42,980
是你的朋友  令親之類的
a friend's, camarade...

2539
01:44:43,060 --> 01:44:44,150
表親嗎
Cousin?

2540
01:44:44,150 --> 01:44:45,230
表親  肯定也行
Cousin, absolute.

2541
01:44:48,900 --> 01:44:50,610
-你是說親戚  -沒錯
- Relative? - Yeah.

2542
01:44:52,820 --> 01:44:55,450
你剛才那是哼小調
Was that yodeling I just heard

2543
01:44:55,580 --> 01:44:58,040
還是我所理解的那個意思
or did you just say what I thought you said?

2544
01:44:58,120 --> 01:44:59,870
就是那個意思
Yes. Yes.

2545
01:45:00,620 --> 01:45:03,170
他這是在建議我建個老鼠倉
He's telling me to use a fucking rathole.

2546
01:45:03,380 --> 01:45:05,040
但一只美國老鼠絕對沒法
But a U.S. rathole would never get

2547
01:45:05,130 --> 01:45:07,340
把那么多錢弄到瑞士來
into Switzerland with all that money.

2548
01:45:07,420 --> 01:45:11,260
我還得找個有歐洲護照的老鼠
What I needed was a rathole with a European passport.

2549
01:45:18,560 --> 01:45:19,980
喬丹
Jordan.

2550
01:45:20,060 --> 01:45:22,940
你好啊  我最親愛的姨媽
Hey. How's my favorite aunt, huh?

2551
01:45:23,020 --> 01:45:24,440
歡迎  路上沒堵車吧
Welcome. Was the traffic terrible?

2552
01:45:24,520 --> 01:45:26,060
沒有  當然沒有
Oh, no, not at all.

2553
01:45:28,610 --> 01:45:30,240
喬丹  快進來
Jordan, come in.

2554
01:45:30,400 --> 01:45:32,900
還好說服艾瑪姨媽沒費多少勁
Thank God Aunt Emma didn't need too much convincing.

2555
01:45:33,570 --> 01:45:36,070
看來英國人跟瑞士人差別也沒那么大嘛
Turned out the British weren't too different from the Swiss.

2556
01:45:36,240 --> 01:45:38,740
只要錢跟上  一切就迎刃而解了
Money talks and bullshit takes the bus.

2557
01:45:39,200 --> 01:45:41,120
英式英語里"老鼠倉"怎么說
How do you say "Rathole" In British?

2558
01:45:41,540 --> 01:45:44,000
一旦你碰上任何麻煩
If you get into any trouble whatsoever,

2559
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:46,840
我就會馬上站出來  承認是我騙了你
I'll come forth immediately. I'll say that I duped you.

2560
01:45:46,920 --> 01:45:48,210
我保證
That I promise.

2561
01:45:48,920 --> 01:45:51,590
冒險尤其能讓人倍感青春  是吧親愛的
Risk is what keeps us young, isn't it, darling?

2562
01:45:55,930 --> 01:45:57,720
有時我禁不住想
Sometimes I wonder

2563
01:45:58,010 --> 01:46:01,020
你是不是讓錢給拿住了  親愛的
if you let money get the best of you, my love.

2564
01:46:01,140 --> 01:46:04,270
以致忽視了其他種種
Among other substances.

2565
01:46:08,690 --> 01:46:10,070
這么明顯啊
It's that obvious, huh?

2566
01:46:10,150 --> 01:46:13,400
天氣一點都不熱  但你卻直冒汗
It's chilly, darling, and you're sweating bullets.

2567
01:46:16,120 --> 01:46:17,950
我該怎么說呢
What can I say? I'm...

2568
01:46:18,830 --> 01:46:20,490
我是個癮君子
I'm a drug addict.

2569
01:46:20,620 --> 01:46:21,950
癮頭非常大
I really am.

2570
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:24,750
白粉  搖頭丸
Cocaine, pills,

2571
01:46:25,250 --> 01:46:27,670
這個那個  我都嗑
whatever it is, I'll fucking do it.

2572
01:46:28,210 --> 01:46:29,920
這是實情
Now that's the truth.

2573
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:31,250
我是說
I mean...

2574
01:46:31,340 --> 01:46:32,710
我還有性癮
I'm a sex addict, too.

2575
01:46:33,630 --> 01:46:36,050
這世上肯定還有比性癮更危險的事
Well, there are worse things to be addicted to than sex.

2576
01:46:37,340 --> 01:46:39,720
天啊  我跟你說這些干什么  我干嘛
Jesus, why am I telling you all this? Why am I...

2577
01:46:39,810 --> 01:46:41,430
真抱歉
I'm sorry.

2578
01:46:42,180 --> 01:46:44,390
因為我是個很好說話的人
Because I'm very easy to talk to.

2579
01:46:44,770 --> 01:46:47,480
還真是  你的確很好說話
You are. You are easy to talk to.

2580
01:46:48,650 --> 01:46:50,070
在我看來
I suppose it's...

2581
01:46:50,150 --> 01:46:51,570
這是我的責任
Just my job, you know.

2582
01:46:52,820 --> 01:46:54,780
有這么多人依仗著我
All these people dependent on me.

2583
01:46:54,860 --> 01:46:57,570
事關數以千萬計的美金  你懂的
Tens of millions of dollars at stake, you know.

2584
01:46:57,660 --> 01:46:59,370
但有時我又覺得
Sometimes I feel like I...

2585
01:46:59,450 --> 01:47:02,620
我有點貪多嚼不爛了
I've bitten off more than I can chew, you know.

2586
01:47:02,830 --> 01:47:05,120
但你的胃口很大
You're a man with large appetites.

2587
01:47:05,290 --> 01:47:06,370
是啊
Yeah.

2588
01:47:08,080 --> 01:47:10,000
這姐們是在挑逗我嗎
Is she fucking hitting on me?

2589
01:47:10,340 --> 01:47:11,380
是啊
Yeah.

2590
01:47:11,500 --> 01:47:12,800
還真是這樣
Yeah, I am.

2591
01:47:15,170 --> 01:47:18,510
看來是我自作自受了哈
I suppose I put that on myself though, right?

2592
01:47:18,840 --> 01:47:20,390
我自己的決定
My decision.

2593
01:47:20,890 --> 01:47:22,350
有時候很難
It's just hard to...

2594
01:47:22,430 --> 01:47:26,350
很難控制內心的焦慮  你懂嗎
Hard to learn to control the anxiety sometimes, you know?

2595
01:47:26,940 --> 01:47:28,480
就是那個
You know, to...

2596
01:47:28,690 --> 01:47:31,360
試著放松  放下心事
learn to relax and let go and...

2597
01:47:32,360 --> 01:47:34,360
去釋放壓力嗎
to release the tension.

2598
01:47:35,400 --> 01:47:36,860
她還真在挑逗我
She is hitting on me.

2599
01:47:37,820 --> 01:47:39,240
我的天啊
Holy shit!

2600
01:47:39,530 --> 01:47:41,780
沒錯  釋放壓力
Yeah, to release the tension.

2601
01:47:45,620 --> 01:47:47,370
看來我們都得
I suppose we...

2602
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:50,250
都得試著做到
We all just need to learn...

2603
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:54,170
順其自然  對吧
learn to do what comes naturally in life, you know?

2604
01:47:56,090 --> 01:47:58,550
這哥們他媽是不是在挑逗我
Is he fucking hitting on me?

2605
01:48:04,770 --> 01:48:06,430
穩住  親愛的
Stability, dear.

2606
01:48:06,520 --> 01:48:07,930
我們是親戚
Family.

2607
01:48:14,570 --> 01:48:16,730
你照顧好我的侄女  親愛的
You take care of my niece, my love.

2608
01:48:16,820 --> 01:48:19,360
這邊放心交給我
I'll take care of everything over here.

2609
01:48:20,320 --> 01:48:21,410
成交
Deal.

2610
01:48:23,950 --> 01:48:26,120
爽  真他媽爽
Come on! There you go.

2611
01:48:28,160 --> 01:48:31,420
我們貨真價實地干了千金一炮
We had, literally, a fuckload of money.

2612
01:48:31,920 --> 01:48:33,920
艾瑪自己可運不了這么多錢
Aunt Emma could never carry all this by herself.

2613
01:48:34,750 --> 01:48:38,420
我就琢磨  還有誰有歐洲護照
So I thought to myself, who else has a European passport?

2614
01:48:38,590 --> 01:48:40,510
布拉德  你捆得太緊了
Brad, you're making this too fucking tight!

2615
01:48:40,590 --> 01:48:43,390
而布拉德作為一個成功的藥販子
Now Brad, as a successful drug dealer,

2616
01:48:43,470 --> 01:48:45,680
每年冬天都要在法國南部度假
spent his winters in the south of France,

2617
01:48:45,760 --> 01:48:47,810
在那里他遇見了他的妻子  仙黛爾
which is where he met his wife, Chantalle,

2618
01:48:47,890 --> 01:48:50,770
她本是斯洛文尼亞的脫衣舞女
a stripper of Slovenian origin

他們人人都有瑞士護照
I mean, they all got Swiss passports, right.

她有父母  有兄弟  是不是
She's got parents, she's got a brother, right?

他們跟她一樣都是瑞士的蠢貨
They're all fucking Swiss nitwits like her.

2632
01:49:28,140 --> 01:49:29,390
-他們會同意的  -沒準能行

至少我還有家人  你個大鼻子蠢貨
At least I have a family, you crooked-nose fuck!

2634
01:49:32,020 --> 01:49:34,850
別忘了我的錢
Hey, don't forget about my money.

2635
01:49:36,650 --> 01:49:37,730
抱歉你說啥
I'm sorry, what's that?

親愛的  你奶子上貼的全是我們的錢
Sweetheart, you have my money taped to your tits.

01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:10,470
我才不會去找他
I ain't going to him, okay.

2649
01:50:10,560 --> 01:50:11,600
-我又不是給他跑腿的  -我懂
- I'm not a fucking shvartze. - I got it.

2650
01:50:11,680 --> 01:50:12,980
我不干上門取件的事  明白嗎
I don't do fucking pickups, all right?

2651
01:50:13,060 --> 01:50:14,100
-我明白  -你聽好了

我說在哪碰頭就在哪
We meet someplace that I fucking say.

2653
01:50:15,850 --> 01:50:17,230

我把丫的牙打回牙床子里去
I'll mash that douchebag's teeth in.

你他媽要打誰的牙床子
You're gonna mash whose fucking teeth in?

2658
01:50:24,700 --> 01:50:26,410
咱倆玩玩看誰打誰的牙床子
Whose fucking teeth are you gonna mash in?

2659

你那破桌子上堆的是我的錢  不是你的

還是和聰明的重要人物做的  不像你
With smart important people, unlike you.

2705
01:52:30,490 --> 01:52:34,370
他們不會因為怕了就動手打人  明白嗎
People who don't sucker-punch people when they're scared. Okay?

2706
01:52:34,450 --> 01:52:35,830
-你是說我怕了  -順便還有

2708
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:38,040
你想要我道歉  是吧
You want an apology, okay.

2709
01:52:38,120 --> 01:52:39,540

2712
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:43,040
我還設置了閃光提醒
I got a blinking light,

2713
01:52:43,130 --> 01:52:44,420
因為你屁都沒跟我吭一聲
because I don't have shit from you.

2714
01:52:44,500 --> 01:52:45,710
你這張欠扇的嘴
You know what, you got a big fucking mouth, okay?

2715
01:52:45,800 --> 01:52:47,050
我叫我老婆隨時候著
I got my wife checking the messages

2716
01:52:47,130 --> 01:52:49,130
每45分鐘給我辦公室打個電話  問我

2717
01:52:49,220 --> 01:52:50,430
"布拉德道歉了嗎"

2718
01:52:50,510 --> 01:52:52,510
"答錄機上有留言嗎"
"Is there an apology message on the machine?"

2719
01:52:52,590 --> 01:52:54,140
我又不是傻的  你知道嗎
I don't have jack shit. You know what?

2720
01:52:54,220 --> 01:52:55,640
你不能這樣對別人
That's not how you treat people.

2721
01:52:55,720 --> 01:52:56,760
你這張嘴太欠扇了
You got a big fucking mouth, you know.

2722
01:52:56,850 --> 01:52:58,520
我不和你計較了  趕緊把包給我
I'm gonna give you a fucking pass. Just give me the case.

2723
01:52:58,600 --> 01:53:00,810
你還不和我計較
You're gonna give me a pass?

2724
01:53:00,890 --> 01:53:02,480
少廢話了行嗎
Look, it's a figure of fucking speech.

2725
01:53:02,560 --> 01:53:04,520
我的天  操蛋村的村長
Oh, my gosh. The Emperor of Fucksville

2726
01:53:04,610 --> 01:53:05,900
從操蛋村下山來不和我計較了
came down from Fucksville to give me a pass!

2727
01:53:05,980 --> 01:53:06,980
操蛋村是吧
From Fucksville, huh?

2728
01:53:07,070 --> 01:53:08,940
那操蛋村的村長今天不在
Hey, what are the citizens of Fucksville doing today

2729
01:53:09,030 --> 01:53:10,490
操蛋村村民都干嘛呢
when their Emperor's gone?

2730
01:53:10,570 --> 01:53:12,110
在暴亂嗎
Is it mayhem?

2731
01:53:12,200 --> 01:53:13,990
到處打砸搶燒  強奸婦女嗎
Are people looting and raping?

2732
01:53:14,070 --> 01:53:16,080
你下山來了那些傻逼都干什么呢
What are all the little fuckheads doing while you're here?

2733
01:53:16,160 --> 01:53:17,580
操你媽的  把包給我
Go fuck yourself! Give me the bag.

2734

你他媽站遠點
You back the fuck up.

2735
01:53:19,040 --> 01:53:20,160
你再過來
I'll cause the biggest

2736
01:53:20,160 --> 01:53:22,500
我都不知道我今天要干出什么
fucking scene that I've ever caused in my life

2737
01:53:22,580 --> 01:53:24,330
驚天動地的大事了
if you come at me again.

2738
01:53:24,420 --> 01:53:26,000
-你知道嗎  -你他媽小聲點
- You know what? - Just fucking keep it down.

2739
01:53:26,090 --> 01:53:27,300
我覺得
I got...

2740
01:53:27,380 --> 01:53:29,640
我不是故意要躲著你
I don't wanna be out of line or anything,

2741
01:53:29,650 --> 01:53:31,970
但我覺得你好像喜歡我
but I think you like, like me. Like you...

2742
01:53:32,050 --> 01:53:33,510
就像你剛靠近我時...
Like when you come at me...

2743
01:53:33,590 --> 01:53:34,680
你今天怎么了  你他媽...

你他媽好像...
You have like a fucking, like...

2746
01:53:38,060 --> 01:53:40,060
眨了下眼  你剛才眨了下眼
Like a twinkle. You have like a twinkle.

2747
01:53:40,140 --> 01:53:41,600
你是想親我嗎  老兄
Are you trying to kiss me, bro?

2748
01:53:41,690 --> 01:53:43,270
我了個操
Jesus fucking Christ.

You're just not the one for me, pal.

2752
01:53:48,980 --> 01:53:50,110
明白我意思嗎  我不是...
You know what I mean? It's not...

-我不是那種人  -我聽夠了
- It's not about that for me, you know. - I've heard enough.

2754
01:53:52,200 --> 01:53:54,610
當我求你  快點把箱子給我

拿出每一張鈔票

01:54:04,580 --> 01:54:06,540
別留任何一張在箱子里
Don't leave one dollar inside the briefcase.

2761
01:54:06,630 --> 01:54:07,750
當你把錢全拿出箱子
And once you have it all

2762
01:54:07,840 --> 01:54:09,630
整齊擺好后
neatly organized outside the briefcase,

2763
01:54:09,710 --> 01:54:12,010
你把它拿起來塞進
I need you to take it and I need you to shove it right up

2764
01:54:12,090 --> 01:54:14,180
你老婆的拉脫維亞逼里面  明白了嗎
your wife's Latvian cunt, you understand?

2765
01:54:14,260 --> 01:54:15,930
-你他媽敢罵我老婆  -淡定  兄弟
- My fucking wife! - Chill! Chill, bro.

2766

-快去  快去  -操

01:54:21,890 --> 01:54:23,600
龜孫子  你他媽死定了
Motherfuck! You're fucking dead!

2770
01:54:23,690 --> 01:54:25,350
站住  不許動  不許動
Stop! Don't move! Don't move!

2771
01:54:25,440 --> 01:54:28,270
快站住  否則我他媽打爆你的頭
Stop, or I will blow you the fuck away!

2772
01:54:28,690 --> 01:54:30,860
放下箱子  把手舉起來
Drop the case! Put your hands in the air!

2773
01:54:30,940 --> 01:54:32,070
跪下
Get down.

2774
01:54:32,860 --> 01:54:34,610
跪下  跪下
Get down on your knees! Get down on your knees!

2775
01:54:35,320 --> 01:54:39,830
我操你媽
Motherfucker!

2776
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:52,210
喬丹  我有個驚喜給你
Jordan, do I have a surprise for you!

2777
01:54:52,460 --> 01:54:55,050
-什么驚喜  -20粒正宗檸檬片
- What's that? - Twenty real Lemmons.

2778
01:54:55,130 --> 01:54:56,300
我認識的一個退休藥劑師
Retired pharmacist's client of mine,

2779
01:54:56,390 --> 01:54:57,550
把它在保險箱放了15年了
they've been in the safe for 15 years.

2780
01:54:57,640 --> 01:54:59,100
你他媽逗我呢  檸檬片
Are you fucking kidding me? Lemmons?

2781
01:55:00,350 --> 01:55:02,220
這能把咱們的腦袋都爽翻天
They're gonna knock us on our fucking heads.

2782
01:55:02,310 --> 01:55:07,230
檸檬714就是安眠藥中的戰斗機
When it comes to Quaaludes, the Lemmon 714 was the Holy Grail.

2783
01:55:07,310 --> 01:55:08,810
-你敢相信嗎  -我的老天
- Can you believe it? - Oh, my God.

2784
01:55:08,900 --> 01:55:10,360
我以為這只是一個神話
I thought they were like a myth.

2785
01:55:10,440 --> 01:55:12,320
這藥比當今市面上的任何一種都要強三倍
Three times as powerful as anything available today.

2786
01:55:12,400 --> 01:55:13,440
看看這些寶貝
Look at these babies.

2787
01:55:13,530 --> 01:55:16,110
唐尼真是懂得怎么慶祝啊
Boy, Donnie really knew how to celebrate.

2788
01:55:16,200 --> 01:55:18,280
他說這個要留在特別時機再用
He said he was saving these for a special occasion.

2789
01:55:18,370 --> 01:55:20,950
比如過生日  擊掌慶祝時
Like a birthday, or being clap free,

2790
01:55:21,030 --> 01:55:24,000
亦或是咱的錢安全抵達瑞士
or our money arriving safely in Switzerland.

2791
01:55:27,420 --> 01:55:28,670
于是當晚
So that night,

2792
01:55:28,750 --> 01:55:30,590
我撇開所有計劃并清除我體內
I cleared my schedule and I rid my body

2793
01:55:30,670 --> 01:55:33,170
任何會影響我爽的東西
of anything that could fuck with my high.

2794
01:55:33,880 --> 01:55:35,670
這是歡慶時刻
It was celebration time.

2795
01:55:36,260 --> 01:55:37,430

先來一顆  看看怎么樣
Start off with one, see how it goes?

2797
01:55:39,090 --> 01:55:40,850
我的藥頭說只能吃一顆
My guy says all we'll need is one.

2798
01:55:40,930 --> 01:55:42,350
給你
Here you go.

2799
01:55:43,060 --> 01:55:44,720
-干杯  -干杯
- Salud! - Cheers.

2800
01:55:44,810 --> 01:55:47,600
說不定我再拉一下就會下去了
Maybe if I pull it again, it'll go down.

2801
01:55:49,350 --> 01:55:50,610
史蒂夫  史蒂夫
Steve! Steve!

2802
01:55:50,690 --> 01:55:51,940
我要離開這兒
I gotta get out of here!

2803
01:55:52,020 --> 01:55:53,900
卡爾  我搞明白了
Carl, I think I got it figured out.

2804
01:55:53,980 --> 01:55:57,700
這個肯定是拉一下朝上拉兩下朝下
It must be one pull for up and two pulls for down.

2805
01:55:57,780 --> 01:55:59,030
好吧
Okay.

2806
01:56:07,370 --> 01:56:09,170
有感覺嗎
Do you feel anything?

2807
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:13,000
沒有
No.

2808
01:56:15,710 --> 01:56:17,550
都35分鐘了
It's been 35 minutes.

2809
01:56:20,050 --> 01:56:23,600
可能我們磕了這么多年有耐藥性了
Maybe we've built up a tolerance after all these years, huh?

2810
01:56:36,740 --> 01:56:38,150
屁用沒有
This is bullshit!

2811
01:56:38,240 --> 01:56:41,410
我的新陳代謝飛速運轉  啥感覺也沒有
My metabolism's pumping. I can't feel shit!

2812
01:56:41,490 --> 01:56:42,660
時間太長了
They're old.

2813
01:56:42,740 --> 01:56:44,910
是不是過期了
You think they lost their potency, huh?

2814
01:56:44,990 --> 01:56:46,620
看下瓶子
Check the bottle!

2815
01:56:49,460 --> 01:56:50,870
81年1月
January '81.

2816
01:56:50,960 --> 01:56:52,040

離我家最近的公用電話
The closest pay phone I could get to

2838
01:57:47,140 --> 01:57:49,430
在布魯克維爾鄉村俱樂部

德納姆  那個FBI探員

2863
01:58:42,570 --> 01:58:46,360
你沒有要賄賂這個FBI探員吧
You didn't try to bribe this fucking FBI agent, did you?

2864
01:58:46,450 --> 01:58:48,490
我沒有賄賂他

檸檬片產生了延遲效果

90分鐘后這些天殺的藥丸才生效
It took 90 minutes for these little fuckers to kick in.

2880
01:59:23,030 --> 01:59:24,400

But once they did...

2881
01:59:25,950 --> 01:59:27,490

I mean, I had skipped the tingle phase

2882
01:59:27,570 --> 01:59:29,490
進入了流口水狀態
and went straight to the drool phase.

2883

告訴我你在哪  別他媽開...

01:59:35,750 --> 01:59:37,790
腦癱狀態
The cerebral palsy phase.

2887
01:59:40,090 --> 01:59:42,090
加油  站起來
Come on, stand up!

2888
01:59:46,050 --> 01:59:47,970
好吧  走路是沒戲了
Okay, walking's out.

2889
01:59:48,930 --> 01:59:51,800
想想  再想想  還有什么辦法
All right, think, think. What else is there?

我在鄉村俱樂部
I'm at a country club!

2901
02:02:20,790 --> 02:02:22,120
我他媽聽不懂你說的什么
I don't know what the fuck you're saying.

你趕緊回家來
Look, you need to get home.

2903
02:02:23,540 --> 02:02:26,170
唐尼已經失控了  他在另外一條線上
Donnie is out of control! He's on the other line

2904
02:02:26,250 --> 02:02:28,130
和一瑞士男在打電話  我不認識
with some Swiss guy. I don't know...

2905
02:02:28,210 --> 02:02:29,210
什么
What?

2906
02:02:29,300 --> 02:02:32,260
別讓他打電話
Get him off the phone!

2907
02:02:32,590 --> 02:02:35,340
我聽不懂你說什么
I can't understand you!

2908
02:02:35,430 --> 02:02:36,680
不要
Get him

2909
02:02:36,760 --> 02:02:37,800
讓他
off

2910
02:02:37,890 --> 02:02:39,010
打電話
the phone!

2911
02:02:39,100 --> 02:02:40,350
我他媽聽不懂你說的什么  喬丹
I don't know what the fuck you're saying, Jordan.

2912
02:02:40,430 --> 02:02:41,770
你能回來嗎  快點
Can you just get home? Hurry!

2913
02:02:51,610 --> 02:02:53,740
我離家還不到一英里
I was less than a mile from home.

2914
02:02:53,820 --> 02:02:56,530
我盡量慢慢開
I drove as slow as I fucking could.

2915
02:02:56,610 --> 02:02:58,620
連果凍滑得都比我快
I'd seen Jell-O move faster.

2916
02:02:58,700 --> 02:03:01,120
我本來要再給你兩百萬
I was gonna give you two million.

2917
02:03:01,290 --> 02:03:03,830
我要吃[遲]一些了
I's gonna be lates.

2918
02:03:04,500 --> 02:03:06,080
你吃了兩百萬
You ate two million?

2919
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:08,250
遲
Later.

2920
02:03:08,330 --> 02:03:09,460
放下電話
Get off the phone.

2921
02:03:09,540 --> 02:03:11,050
放下那天殺的電話  傻逼
Get off the fucking phone! Idiot!

2922
02:03:12,420 --> 02:03:14,510
別擋路  蠢驢
Get out of the way, asshole!

2923
02:03:17,180 --> 02:03:18,430
你恨兩百萬
You hate two million?

2924
02:03:18,510 --> 02:03:20,010
你可不能恨兩百萬  唐尼
No, you don't hate two million, Donnie.

2925
02:03:22,560 --> 02:03:25,430
奇跡般地  我活著回到了家
By some miracle, I made it home alive,

2926
02:03:25,520 --> 02:03:27,810
我和車都沒有蹭到
not a scratch on me or the car.

2927
02:03:37,240 --> 02:03:38,320
喬丹
Jordan?

2928
02:03:38,820 --> 02:03:41,410
我了個大操
Jesus fucking Christ!

2929
02:03:41,490 --> 02:03:42,990
你吃什么了
What did you take?

2930
02:03:43,080 --> 02:03:44,370
你有毛病啊你
What's wrong with you?

2931
02:03:44,450 --> 02:03:45,450
喬
Jor!

2932
02:03:45,540 --> 02:03:47,920
爽歪歪了對吧
It's fucking good, right?

2933
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:49,330
閉嘴
Fucked up!

2934
02:03:50,670 --> 02:03:52,500
放下電話
Get off the phone!

2935
02:03:55,550 --> 02:03:57,760
你搞什么  喬丹
What the fuck, Jordan?

2936
02:03:57,840 --> 02:03:59,430
你女兒在家呢
Your daughter's in the house!

2937
02:03:59,510 --> 02:04:00,590
你最好弄清楚
I hope you know that!

2938
02:04:00,680 --> 02:04:02,010
他媽的你女兒在家呢
Your fucking daughter's in the house!

2939
02:04:02,510 --> 02:04:03,850
太他媽好玩了  唐尼
Yeah, it's real fucking funny, Donnie.

2940
02:04:04,060 --> 02:04:06,480
放下電話
Get off the phone!

2941
02:04:07,640 --> 02:04:08,600
天啊  喬丹
Jesus Christ, Jordan.

2942
02:04:08,690 --> 02:04:10,350
有FBI
The FBI!

2943
02:04:11,690 --> 02:04:12,940
嘿
Hey!

2944
02:04:13,480 --> 02:04:15,360
我正打著呢
I'm on phone!

2945
02:04:15,570 --> 02:04:17,950
你媽逼快放下電話

02:04:31,790 --> 02:04:33,290
我正打著呢
I'm on the phone!

2949
02:04:33,380 --> 02:04:34,710
正打著呢
On the phone!

02:04:34,800 --> 02:04:36,880
我知道你干的好事
I know what you did,

2951
02:04:37,380 --> 02:04:38,800
你個王八操的
you piece of shit!

2952
02:04:38,880 --> 02:04:40,590
什么  什么
What? What?

2953
02:04:40,680 --> 02:04:46,890
布拉德
Brad!

2954
02:04:46,980 --> 02:04:49,390
你個吸雞巴的
You fucking cocksucker!

2955
02:04:53,730 --> 02:04:55,610
你都干了些什么好事
What did you do,

2956
02:04:55,690 --> 02:04:57,480
你個垃圾
you piece of shit?

2957
02:04:57,570 --> 02:04:58,990
操你媽
Fuck you!

2958
02:05:00,240 --> 02:05:04,780
我他媽宰了你
I wanna fucking kill you!

2959
02:05:05,740 --> 02:05:07,080
抓住你了
I got you!

2960
02:05:31,640 --> 02:05:33,560
這他媽怎么回事
What the fuck happened?

2961
02:05:34,020 --> 02:05:35,270
我操
Oh, shit!

2962
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:37,230
喬丹  喬丹  你還好嗎
Jordan? Jordan, are you all right?

2963
02:05:37,400 --> 02:05:38,980
唐尼  唐尼
Donnie? Donnie?

2964
02:05:39,320 --> 02:05:40,400
唐尼
Donnie?

2965
02:05:40,490 --> 02:05:41,820
喬丹  他上不來氣了
Jordan, he's not breathing.

2966
02:05:41,910 --> 02:05:43,700
哦操  我不知道該怎么辦
Oh, fuck, I don't know what to do.

2967
02:05:43,780 --> 02:05:45,030
喬丹  我不知道該怎么辦
Jordan, I don't know what the fuck to do!

2968
02:05:45,120 --> 02:05:46,450
我幫不了他了  我的天  喬丹
I can't help him! Oh, my God. Jordan.

2969
02:05:48,490 --> 02:05:51,040
天吶  他嗆住了  喬丹  快來幫忙
Oh, my God, I think he's choking, Jordan. Do something.

2970
02:05:51,120 --> 02:05:52,870
-天啊  -寶貝  我來了
- Oh, God. - Baby, I got you!

2971
02:05:53,460 --> 02:05:56,340
他沒氣了  喬丹  你快來幫忙啊
He's not breathing, Jordan. You gotta do something!

2972
02:05:57,250 --> 02:05:59,550
操  天啊  我的天啊
Shit! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

2973
02:06:01,470 --> 02:06:02,800
我來了
I got you.

2974
02:06:22,150 --> 02:06:23,740
靠邊站
Step aside!

2975
02:06:23,990 --> 02:06:27,280
老天啊
Oh, God!

2976
02:06:27,660 --> 02:06:29,410
靠邊站  寶貝
Move aside, baby.

2977
02:06:36,380 --> 02:06:38,170
快點  快點
Come on! Come on!

2978
02:06:38,250 --> 02:06:39,460
來啊
Come on!

2979
02:06:44,010 --> 02:06:46,680
喬丹  他沒呼吸了  快想點辦法啊
Jordan, he's not breathing. You gotta do something.

2980
02:06:47,720 --> 02:06:49,760
喬丹  他還有家有孩子呢
Jordan, he's a father! He's got fucking kids!

2981
02:06:49,850 --> 02:06:51,520
-快想點辦法  -好
- Do something! - Yeah?

2982
02:06:57,190 --> 02:06:58,270
羅科  快過來
Rocco, you gotta get over here.

2983
02:06:58,360 --> 02:07:00,270
-來啊  -快叫救護車
- Come on. - Call an ambulance!

2984
02:07:00,360 --> 02:07:01,530
我他媽也不知道
I don't fucking know!

2985
02:07:01,610 --> 02:07:03,360
趕快過來報警
Just get over here! Call 911.

2986
02:07:13,960 --> 02:07:16,290
你還好吧  他沒事了
You all right? He's all right.

2987
02:07:29,470 --> 02:07:33,970
貝爾福先生
Mr. Belfort?

2988
02:07:36,640 --> 02:07:39,560
滾出去  滾
Get the fuck out of here. Fuck.

2989
02:07:39,650 --> 02:07:42,150
先生  我們需要問你幾個問題
Sir, we need to ask you some questions.

2990
02:07:42,820 --> 02:07:44,780
你他媽開玩笑吧  去你媽
Are you fucking kidding me? Fuck you.

2991
02:07:44,860 --> 02:07:45,990
來吧  站起來
Come on, get up.

2992
02:07:46,070 --> 02:07:47,610
滾出我的房子
Get the fuck out of my house.

2993
02:07:49,410 --> 02:07:51,120
-走吧  -我整晚都在這兒
- Let's go. - I've been here all night.

2994
02:07:51,200 --> 02:07:52,700
整晚都坐在這兒
I been sitting here all night.

2995
02:07:52,790 --> 02:07:54,160
你們他媽什么意思
What the fuck are you talking about?

2996
02:07:54,250 --> 02:07:56,200
-你們帶他去哪兒  -你們帶我去哪兒
- Where you taking him? - Where you taking me?

2997
02:07:56,290 --> 02:07:57,370
你們帶他去哪兒
Where you taking him?

2998
02:07:57,460 --> 02:07:58,500
你們又沒有搜查證
You ain't got no warrant.

2999
02:07:58,580 --> 02:07:59,880
怎么能隨便到別人家里來
Just come up in people's house like that!

3000
02:08:01,040 --> 02:08:03,340
你今晚開過你的車嗎  貝爾福先生
Did you drive your car tonight, Mr. Belfort?

3001
02:08:04,920 --> 02:08:05,960
怎么說呢
Well?

3002
02:08:10,930 --> 02:08:12,720
看來我并沒有安然無恙地到家
Maybe I hadn't made it home okay.

3003
02:08:27,860 --> 02:08:30,240
快他媽讓開
Get out of the fucking way!

3004
02:08:32,200 --> 02:08:33,450
我擦
Fuck!

3005
02:08:39,080 --> 02:08:42,710
你今晚開過這輛車嗎
Did you drive that car tonight?

3006
02:08:43,840 --> 02:08:45,960
-有  -好的
- Yeah. - Yeah, right.

3007
02:08:46,050 --> 02:08:47,840
我可是有家室的
I'm a family man!

3008
02:08:47,920 --> 02:08:49,670
有家室的  親愛的
Family man. Honey!

3009
02:08:49,760 --> 02:08:51,720
我沒把自己撞死
It was a miracle I wasn't killed,

3010
02:08:51,800 --> 02:08:54,810
或者撞死別人真是個奇跡
or that I didn't kill anybody else.

3011
02:08:54,890 --> 02:08:58,060
警察帶我去問了話  但他們沒法起訴我
The cops took me in for questioning, but they couldn't charge me.

3012
02:08:58,140 --> 02:09:00,560
他們沒法證明我開了車
They had no proof I was even behind the wheel.

3013
02:09:00,650 --> 02:09:01,730
與此同時
Meanwhile,

3014
02:09:01,810 --> 02:09:03,900
布拉德因為蔑視法庭坐了三個月牢
Brad did three months in jail for contempt,

3015
02:09:03,980 --> 02:09:06,570
因為他不肯供出唐尼
because he wouldn't rat Donnie out.

3016
02:09:06,650 --> 02:09:09,360
結果就是  我安然無恙
The result, I was scot-free.

3017
02:09:09,450 --> 02:09:11,820
但我也受到了前所未有的監視
But I had eyes on me like never before.

3018
02:09:11,910 --> 02:09:13,570
你真是走運  喬丹
You're a lucky man, Jordan.

3019
02:09:13,660 --> 02:09:16,580
居然能活著  還不用坐牢
You're lucky to be alive, let alone not in jail.

3020
02:09:16,660 --> 02:09:18,250
你知道我不相信運氣的  對吧
You know I don't believe in luck, right?

3021
02:09:18,330 --> 02:09:19,660
但是是時候了
But it's time.

3022
02:09:19,750 --> 02:09:22,000
拜托讓我跟證監會談好條件
Please, let me call the SEC and cut a deal

3023
02:09:22,080 --> 02:09:24,000
在你運氣用光以前
before your luck runs out.

3024
02:09:24,090 --> 02:09:25,670
跟爸爸揮揮手
Wave to Daddy.

3025
02:09:25,750 --> 02:09:26,840
嗨
Hey.

3026
02:09:26,920 --> 02:09:28,420
你好啊  甜心
Hey, sweetie.

3027
02:09:33,640 --> 02:09:36,930
都有什么條件  如果我...
What kind of terms would you be talking about if I...

3028
02:09:37,010 --> 02:09:38,220
這很難說
I don't know.

3029
02:09:38,310 --> 02:09:41,270
你得坦白一些違反證券規則
You plead guilty to a handful of securities violations,

3030
02:09:41,350 --> 02:09:44,400
操縱股價  高壓銷售
stock manipulation, high-pressure sales tactics.

3031
02:09:44,480 --> 02:09:47,270
都是這樣的小罪  你懂的
Ticky-tack shit like that, you know.

3032
02:09:47,360 --> 02:09:49,320
你得付幾百萬的罰款
You pay a couple million dollars in fines,

3033
02:09:49,400 --> 02:09:52,360
作為交換  證監會永遠不會再煩你
in exchange, the SEC fucks off till the end of time.

3034
02:09:54,700 --> 02:09:56,320
那斯特拉頓呢
And Stratton?

3035
02:09:56,830 --> 02:09:58,700
斯特拉頓會怎么樣
What happens to Stratton?

3036
02:09:58,790 --> 02:10:01,620
沒別的辦法...你必須收手  對吧
There's no way... I mean... You got to walk away. Right?

3037
02:10:01,710 --> 02:10:02,830
讓唐尼管事就行
Let Donnie be in charge.

3038
02:10:02,920 --> 02:10:04,540
沒錯  唐尼
Right. Donnie.

3039
02:10:05,250 --> 02:10:07,420
FBI可沒那么好對付
Now the FBI is another animal completely.

3040
02:10:07,500 --> 02:10:09,300
他們會繼續追查你的犯罪行為
They'll still be pursuing you for criminal wrongdoing.

3041
02:10:09,380 --> 02:10:12,130
不過  只要你自愿離職
However, with you stepping down voluntarily,

3042
02:10:12,220 --> 02:10:14,130
我猜你的好朋友德納姆探員
my guess is that your best friend Agent Denham

3043
02:10:14,220 --> 02:10:16,550
也就無計可施了
will be standing around with his dick in his hand.

3044
02:10:17,680 --> 02:10:18,970
喬丹
Jordan.

3045
02:10:19,060 --> 02:10:20,970
你還有什么好考慮的
What do you have to think about?

3046
02:10:21,060 --> 02:10:22,640
你打敗了他們
You beat them.

3047
02:10:22,730 --> 02:10:23,850
你贏了
You won!

3048
02:10:23,940 --> 02:10:25,560
你一輩子都不用工作了
God knows you never have to work again.

3049
02:10:25,650 --> 02:10:27,650
你還想怎么樣  在牢里度過余生嗎
What're you gonna do? Spend the rest of your life in jail?

3050
02:10:27,730 --> 02:10:28,820
-你想那樣嗎  -不想
- Is that what you want? - No.

3051
02:10:28,900 --> 02:10:29,940
-當然不想  -那不就得了
- Of course not. - Okay.

3052
02:10:30,030 --> 02:10:32,070
你已經掙了全世界的財富
Okay! You got all the money in the world.

3053
02:10:32,150 --> 02:10:33,740
難道還想把所有人的錢都掙光嗎
You need everybody else's money?

3054
02:10:33,820 --> 02:10:35,240
-當然不是  爸  -所以啊

3056
02:10:37,740 --> 02:10:39,450
你創造了這些  現在你得保住它們
You built it, so now preserve it.

3057
02:11:10,690 --> 02:11:12,110
你知道
You know,

3058
02:11:12,490 --> 02:11:15,200
五年前  當我和唐尼·亞速一起創立
five years ago, when I started Stratton Oakmont

3059
02:11:15,280 --> 02:11:17,360
斯特拉頓·奧克蒙特的時候  我就知道
with Donnie Azoff, I knew the day

3060
02:11:17,450 --> 02:11:20,740
總有一天我要離開這里
would eventually come where I'd have to be moving on.

3061
02:11:22,700 --> 02:11:26,500
現在我非常沉重地宣布...
And it's truly with a heavy heart that I'm here to say that...

3062
02:11:28,130 --> 02:11:30,290
那一天終于來了

3063
02:11:34,510 --> 02:11:36,800
我想...我想謝謝你們所有人

謝謝你們多年的忠誠與敬仰
Your years of loyalty and admiration.

3065
02:11:39,640 --> 02:11:41,100
但重點是
But the point is this.

3066
02:11:42,060 --> 02:11:43,310
在唐尼的領導下
Under Donnie's leadership,

3067
02:11:43,390 --> 02:11:46,850
再加上尼基·克斯考夫和羅比·范伯格
along with Nicky Koskoff and Robbie Feinberg

3068
02:11:46,940 --> 02:11:48,530
加入領導層
moving into key management positions,

3069
02:11:48,530 --> 02:11:51,150
這里只會比原來更好

我不管你是誰  從哪里來
I don't care who you are, where you're from,

3074
02:12:03,910 --> 02:12:06,410
不管你的祖先是坐他媽的五月花號
whether your relatives came over on the fucking Mayflower

3075
02:12:06,500 --> 02:12:08,670
還是從海蒂坐輪胎漂過來的
or on an inner tube from Haiti,

3076
02:12:08,750 --> 02:12:11,000
這里就是你的希望之地
this right here is the land of opportunity.

3077
02:12:11,090 --> 02:12:13,590
斯特拉頓·奧克蒙特就是美利堅
Stratton Oakmont is America!

3078

別這樣  幾米
Come on, Kimmie.

3082
02:12:23,720 --> 02:12:25,270
你們可能不知道的是
What you probably didn't know is,

3083
02:12:25,350 --> 02:12:27,140
幾米是這里最早的經紀人之一

3084

斯特拉頓最初的二十名員工之一

3085
02:12:30,270 --> 02:12:32,110
你們大部分人認識的幾米
Now most of you met Kimmie,

3086
02:12:32,190 --> 02:12:35,190
是現在這個美麗優雅的女性

3091
02:12:54,500 --> 02:12:56,840
我遇到的幾米可不是這樣的
That's not the Kimmie that I met.

3092
02:12:59,680 --> 02:13:03,430
我遇到的幾米身無分文
The Kimmie that I met didn't have two nickels to rub together.

3093
02:13:04,680 --> 02:13:06,930
她是個窮困潦倒的單親母親
She was a single mom on the balls of her ass

3094
02:13:07,020 --> 02:13:08,810
有個八歲的兒子

02:13:08,890 --> 02:13:11,900
她已經欠了三個月的房租
Okay? She was three months behind on her rent.

3096
02:13:12,980 --> 02:13:16,650
她來我這兒找工作的時候

只想要五千塊的預付工資
she asked for a $5,000 advance,

3098
02:13:19,030 --> 02:13:22,200
來付她兒子的學費

3099
02:13:26,660 --> 02:13:28,370
我是怎么做的  幾米
And what'd I do, Kimmie?

3100

告訴他們
Go on, tell them.

3101
02:13:31,920 --> 02:13:33,960
你給我寫了一張
You wrote me a check

3102
02:13:34,210 --> 02:13:36,290
兩萬五千塊的支票
for $25,000.

3103
02:13:37,590 --> 02:13:39,050
沒錯
That's right.

3104

02:13:49,020 --> 02:13:51,310
因為我相信你
It's because I believed in you.

3107
02:13:53,020 --> 02:13:55,730
因為我相信你  幾米
It's because I believed in you, Kimmie,

3108
02:13:56,150 --> 02:14:00,030
就像我相信今天在場的每一位
just like I believe in each and every one of you here today.

3109
02:14:00,110 --> 02:14:02,530
-我他媽愛你  喬丹  -我他媽愛你
- I fucking love you, Jordan! - I fucking love you.

3110
02:14:02,610 --> 02:14:04,410

我從心底愛你們所有人

3114
02:14:15,210 --> 02:14:17,670
-我他媽也愛你  -真心的
- I fucking love you, too. - I mean that.

3115
02:14:18,500 --> 02:14:20,800
你最屌  你他媽最屌了
You are the shit. You are the fucking shit.

3116
02:14:27,300 --> 02:14:29,470
真是諷刺啊
It's a shame, you know.

3117
02:14:31,060 --> 02:14:32,600
這么多年來  我一直告訴你們
For years, I've been telling

3118
02:14:32,600 --> 02:14:35,190
不要接受別人的拒絕  對吧
you guys never to take no for an answer, right?

3119
02:14:35,270 --> 02:14:38,480
繼續努力  不要掛下電話
You know, to keep pushing, to never hang up the phone

3120
02:14:39,400 --> 02:14:41,650
知道你得到你想要的
until you get what you want.

3121
02:14:42,530 --> 02:14:44,280
因為那是你應得的
Because you all deserve it.

3122
02:14:46,320 --> 02:14:49,490
而我就要簽的那個混蛋協議
You know, this fucking deal that I'm about to sign,

3123
02:14:49,990 --> 02:14:52,120
禁止我參與證券行業

3124
02:14:52,200 --> 02:14:54,250
禁止我進入斯特拉頓
barring me from Stratton,

3125
02:14:55,330 --> 02:14:56,750
我的家
my home.

3126
02:14:59,500 --> 02:15:01,500
這他媽算什么啊
What the fuck is that, you know?

3127
02:15:02,720 --> 02:15:05,050
我來告訴你它是什么  它是...
I'll tell you what it is. It's...

3128
02:15:05,800 --> 02:15:08,600
是我接受別人的拒絕
It's me taking no for an answer, you know.

3129
02:15:10,100 --> 02:15:11,350
是他們...
It's them...

3130
02:15:11,430 --> 02:15:14,680
他們說服了我  而不是反過來
It's them selling me, not the other way around.

3131
02:15:15,440 --> 02:15:18,150
是我變成了偽君子
It's me being a hypocrite is what it is.

3132
02:15:23,320 --> 02:15:24,570
所以...
So...

3133
02:15:31,700 --> 02:15:33,240
你猜怎么著
You know what?

3134
02:15:37,040 --> 02:15:42,250
我不走了
I'm not leaving.

3135
02:15:45,220 --> 02:15:46,380
我他媽不走了
I'm not fucking leaving!

3136
02:15:51,430 --> 02:15:53,850
你他媽升不了職啦
You're not getting a fucking promotion!

3137
02:15:55,230 --> 02:15:56,560
演出繼續
The show goes on!

3138
02:15:59,190 --> 02:16:00,610
這是我的家
This is my home!

3139
02:16:00,690 --> 02:16:03,440
他們得拆了這地方
They're gonna need a fucking wrecking ball

3140
02:16:03,530 --> 02:16:05,400
才能把我弄走
to take me out of here!

3141
02:16:07,400 --> 02:16:09,910
讓他們派國民警衛隊來吧
They're gonna need to send in the National Guard

3142
02:16:09,990 --> 02:16:11,740
或者他媽的特警隊
or fucking SWAT team,

3143
02:16:11,830 --> 02:16:14,330
因為我哪兒也不去
'cause I ain't going nowhere!

3144
02:16:17,160 --> 02:16:22,420
去他們的
Fuck them!

3145

喬迪  回來
Jordy! Get back here!

3147
02:17:01,290 --> 02:17:02,460
喂
Hey!

3148
02:17:04,920 --> 02:17:06,170
給我
Give me that.

3149
02:17:08,670 --> 02:17:09,800
這算什么
What is this?

3150
02:17:09,880 --> 02:17:12,390
叢林大狂歡嗎  上帝啊
Ramar of the Jungle, for Christ sake?

3151

帕迪  你走運了  愛爾蘭小子
Paddy D, mazel tov, you Irishman.

喬丹·貝爾福撕毀了和證監會的協議
Jordan Belfort just welched on his deal with the SEC.

3153

我們開始了盛大的狂歡
It was our time to party big.

3155
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,620
正好布拉德也出獄了
And just as Brad was released from jail, too.

3156
02:17:41,460 --> 02:17:45,420
我道歉  賠他入獄期間的損失
I apologized, even offered to pay him for his time in the can.

3157
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,090
但他拒絕了  說他不干了
But he said no, that he was out.

3158
02:17:48,170 --> 02:17:50,050
他不想再跟我們有瓜葛
He didn't want any part of us.

3159
02:17:50,130 --> 02:17:51,760
可惜的是
Sad thing was,

3163
02:18:00,850 --> 02:18:04,100
他們倒也沒什么共同點  不過...

3164
02:18:04,190 --> 02:18:06,520
算了  我也不知道怎么會想到這些的
Anyway, I don't know why that came to mind.

3165

沒過幾天  傳票就開始滿天飛

唐尼都給弄得缺水了

美國政府要給我們傳票
United States government wants to give me a subpoena?

咱們斯特拉頓·奧克蒙特就這么對付傳票
Here's what we do with subpoenas at Stratton Oakmont!

3170
02:18:29,460 --> 02:18:32,090

我血壓低  甲狀腺的問題

02:19:07,670 --> 02:19:09,210
讓他問問題吧
Tell him to proceed with the questions.

3187
02:19:09,290 --> 02:19:11,750
但沒有一個斯特拉頓人崩潰

3188

02:19:13,590 --> 02:19:15,130

你給佛朗西斯·索特吉打了很多通電話

02:19:30,900 --> 02:19:32,650
-我不記得  -這個阿杜卜勒...
- I do not recall any of that. - This Abdul...

3199
02:19:32,740 --> 02:19:34,900
我不...不  我不記得
I do not... No, I don't recall.

3200
02:19:34,990 --> 02:19:36,650
那通電話打了很久
It was a long phone call.

3201
02:19:36,740 --> 02:19:38,410
我想知道你還有沒有印象
I just wondered if you have any memory of that.

3202
02:19:38,490 --> 02:19:39,770
好了  我們已經
Okay. You know we've talked

3203
02:19:39,770 --> 02:19:41,660
跟這里的好幾名員工談過了
to several of the employees at this firm,

3204
02:19:41,740 --> 02:19:45,040
沒人記得史蒂夫·麥登首次公開募股的事
and nobody can recall anything about this Steve Madden IPO.

3205
02:19:45,120 --> 02:19:46,370
我覺得挺奇怪的
I think it's odd.

3206
02:19:48,250 --> 02:19:50,750
你記得運輸公司嗎
Do you recall Cartage Corporation?

3207
02:19:52,250 --> 02:19:53,500
你記得嗎
You do recall it?

3208
02:19:53,590 --> 02:19:54,880
不  我完全不記得
No, I don't recall that at all.

3209
02:19:55,470 --> 02:19:58,380
抱歉  我想問你的頭發是真的嗎
Excuse me. I have to ask. Is that your real hair?

3210
02:19:59,010 --> 02:20:01,140
你想談這個嗎
Are you gonna say anything about that?

3211
02:20:01,220 --> 02:20:02,510
要對我的頭發品頭論足嗎
Are you gonna comment on my hair?

3212
02:20:02,600 --> 02:20:04,310
我們是來談這些...談私人問題的嗎
Is that how we're doing... Is this personal questions?

3213
02:20:04,390 --> 02:20:06,060
我只是好奇你的發型
I'm just wondering why you would wear something like that.

3214
02:20:06,140 --> 02:20:07,980
抱歉  我不記得那家公司
Sorry. I don't recall that company.

3215
02:20:10,060 --> 02:20:11,810
還需要什么嗎  先生
Can I get you anything else, gentlemen?

3216
02:20:11,900 --> 02:20:13,730
親愛的  我有一種罕見的病
Yes. Sweetheart, I have a rare condition

3217
02:20:13,820 --> 02:20:17,240
必須每15分鐘喝一杯  拜托了
which requires me to drink one of those every 15 minutes, please.

3218
02:20:17,700 --> 02:20:20,820
我們被明確告知不能出國
We were specifically advised not to leave the country.

3219
02:20:20,910 --> 02:20:22,950
所以我們帶著老婆去了意大利
So, we took our wives to Italy.

3220
02:20:23,330 --> 02:20:25,750
我們覺得在海外辦公會更安全
We figured we were safer working from overseas

3221
02:20:25,830 --> 02:20:27,210
只要給魯格拉特下命令就好
giving orders to Rugrat.

3222
02:20:27,290 --> 02:20:29,460
沒人能逮捕我們  也沒人能證明
Nobody could arrest us and nobody could prove

3223
02:20:29,540 --> 02:20:31,540
我在游艇上操控著斯特拉頓
I was still running Stratton from a yacht.

3224
02:20:31,630 --> 02:20:32,880
嘿  魯格拉特
Hey, Rugrat.

3225
02:20:32,960 --> 02:20:34,130
你好啊
Bonjour.

3226
02:20:34,210 --> 02:20:36,210
你這禿頭鷹  還好嗎
You bald-headed eagle, how you doing?

3227
02:20:36,300 --> 02:20:37,260
唐尼  唐尼  聽著
Donnie, Donnie, listen!

3228
02:20:37,340 --> 02:20:38,630
我們有麻煩了
We have a problem, okay.

3229
02:20:38,720 --> 02:20:41,970
你的朋友史蒂夫·麥登正在拋售股份
Your friend, Steve Madden, is unloading shares.

3230
02:20:42,050 --> 02:20:44,100
你說什么呢  誰告訴你的
What are you saying? Who told you that?

3231
02:20:44,180 --> 02:20:45,770
-怎么了  -是真的  唐尼
- What's going on? - He's doing it, Donnie!

3232
02:20:45,850 --> 02:20:48,310
他說史蒂夫·麥登在拋售股份
He said that Steve Madden's unloading shares.

3233
02:20:48,390 --> 02:20:49,520
誰跟你說的  真是胡扯
Who told you that? It's bullshit!

3234
02:20:49,600 --> 02:20:51,940
快把電話給我
Give me that goddamn phone.

3235
02:20:52,020 --> 02:20:53,560
-怎么了  -別聽他的...
- What's going on? - Don't listen...

3236
02:20:53,770 --> 02:20:55,860
喬丹  聽著  我正盯著屏幕呢
Jordan, look. I'm watching the screen

3237
02:20:55,940 --> 02:20:58,650
有大量的史蒂夫·麥登股票被拋售
and huge chunks of Steve Madden are being sold, okay.

3238
02:20:58,740 --> 02:21:00,780
不是我們賣的  所以只能是史蒂夫
It's not coming from us, so it's gotta be Steve.

3239
02:21:00,860 --> 02:21:02,910
只有他有那么多股份
He's the only person with that many shares.

3240
02:21:02,990 --> 02:21:03,950
我是唐尼  打給我  好嗎
It's Donnie. Call me back, all right.

3241
02:21:04,030 --> 02:21:06,370
唐尼  你的小朋友想害我  你知道嗎
Donnie, your little friend is trying to fuck me, you know that.

3242
02:21:06,500 --> 02:21:08,200
你的小朋友想害死我
Your little friend is trying to fuck me right in the ass.

3243
02:21:08,290 --> 02:21:09,870
-現在就給他打電話  -我們還不確定
- Get him on the phone now! - We don't know anything yet.

3244
02:21:09,960 --> 02:21:11,330
別急著下結論
Let's not jump to conclusions.

3245
02:21:11,830 --> 02:21:13,540
盡管我掌握了百分之八十五的
Even though I owned 85%

3246
02:21:13,630 --> 02:21:16,670
史蒂夫·操蛋·混球·麥登鞋業的股份
of Steve-cocksucking- motherfucking-Madden Shoes,

3247
02:21:16,760 --> 02:21:19,010
但股權都是在他名下的
the shares were in his fucking name.

3248
02:21:19,090 --> 02:21:21,300
這混蛋知道調查局在找我麻煩
This motherfucker knew I was in trouble with the feds

3249
02:21:21,390 --> 02:21:23,180
想要趁火打劫
and was trying to take advantage.

3250
02:21:23,260 --> 02:21:24,760
說話啊  你準備怎么辦
Talk to me, man. How do you wanna play this?

3251
02:21:24,850 --> 02:21:26,600
我要你現在就打給所有的客戶
I want you to get all our clients on the phone right now,

3252
02:21:26,680 --> 02:21:27,970
讓他們開始賣史蒂夫·麥登的股票
and have them start selling Steve Madden.

3253
02:21:28,060 --> 02:21:29,520
我們得把他媽的股價降下來
We're gonna drive that fucking price down!

3254
02:21:29,600 --> 02:21:31,100
聽到了嗎  你他媽閉嘴
Do you hear me? Shut the fuck up!

3255
02:21:31,230 --> 02:21:32,850
他是你的高中同學
This is your fucking friend from high school.

3256
02:21:33,020 --> 02:21:35,110
要是那個小混球想弄我
If that little fucking prick thinks he can fuck with me,

3257
02:21:35,190 --> 02:21:37,780
我們就把他的公司弄成低價股  懂了嗎
we'll turn his company into a penny stock! You hear me?

3258
02:21:37,860 --> 02:21:39,280
-聽到了嗎  -聽到了
- You got it? - Yes. I got it!

3259
02:21:39,360 --> 02:21:40,350
在了解情況之前
Let's just not jump to

3260
02:21:40,350 --> 02:21:42,280
先別急著下結論
conclusions before we know what's going on.

3261
02:21:42,360 --> 02:21:44,910
泰德船長
Captain Ted!

3262
02:21:45,410 --> 02:21:47,790
把電話掛了  所有人
Hang up your phones! Everybody, hey!

3263
02:21:47,870 --> 02:21:50,620
掉頭  我們回家
Turn the boat around! We're going home!

3264
02:21:53,750 --> 02:21:56,130
寶貝  寶貝  怎么了

3265
02:21:56,420 --> 02:21:57,670
我...
I just...

3266
02:21:58,090 --> 02:21:59,340
親愛的  出什么事了
Sweetheart, what's going on?

3267
02:22:00,470 --> 02:22:02,090
艾瑪姑姑
Aunt Emma...

3268
02:22:02,970 --> 02:22:04,260
等一下
Just wait.

3269
02:22:04,680 --> 02:22:06,300
我不行
I can't...

3270
02:22:06,390 --> 02:22:09,270
怎么了  你怎么哭了
What's going on? Why you crying?

3271
02:22:09,350 --> 02:22:11,390
-她死了  -誰  誰死了
- She's dead! - Who? Who's dead?

3272
02:22:11,480 --> 02:22:13,850
我剛接到貝蒂表姐的電話
I just got a call from my cousin Betty.

3273
02:22:13,940 --> 02:22:15,020
然后呢
Yeah?

3274
02:22:15,110 --> 02:22:16,810
艾瑪姑姑死了
Aunt Emma is dead.

3275
02:22:18,230 --> 02:22:20,940
-你他媽在開玩笑吧  -沒有
- Are you fucking kidding me? - No.

3276
02:22:21,280 --> 02:22:22,450
你認真的嗎
You're serious?

3277
02:22:23,240 --> 02:22:25,530
天啊  寶貝  這真是...
Oh, my God! Baby, that's...

3278
02:22:25,620 --> 02:22:27,070
我操
Oh, fuck!

3279
02:22:27,160 --> 02:22:28,950
親愛的  真是...
Oh, sweetheart, that's just...

3280
02:22:29,040 --> 02:22:30,370
去你妹的心臟病
Fucking heart attack!

3281
02:22:30,450 --> 02:22:32,040
砰  啪  嗝屁
Boom, snap, gone.

3282
02:22:32,120 --> 02:22:33,960
從此遠離塵世
Shuffled off her mortal coil.

3283
02:22:34,040 --> 02:22:37,380
我的兩千萬困在瑞士的銀行賬戶里了
And $20 million stuck in a Swiss bank account.

3284
02:22:37,460 --> 02:22:39,550
上次見到她  她還好好的呢
The last time I talked to her she was fine!

3285
02:22:39,630 --> 02:22:41,800
-她也沒那么老  -天啊  寶貝
- She's not that old. - Oh, God! Baby, oh, God!

3286
02:22:41,880 --> 02:22:44,050
太他媽糟糕了
That's so fucking terrible!

3287
02:22:44,130 --> 02:22:45,840
我操
Oh, fuck!

3288
02:22:45,930 --> 02:22:46,930
真是糟糕
It is terrible.

3289
02:22:47,010 --> 02:22:49,560
你姨媽是個端莊美麗的女人
Your aunt was such an elegant, attractive woman.

3290

請接收我對你和你家人的慰問

謝謝你的慰問
Thank you so much for your condolences.

3293
02:22:55,150 --> 02:22:58,060
那她的賬戶要怎么處理
Now where does that leave us in regard to her account exactly?

3294
02:22:58,150 --> 02:22:59,650
是要被審查還是怎樣
Does it go into probate or what?

3295
02:22:59,730 --> 02:23:01,320
這個你不需要擔心  喬丹
Not to worry, Jordan. Not to worry.

3296
02:23:01,400 --> 02:23:03,070
你姑姑在死之前
Your aunt, before she died,

3297
02:23:03,150 --> 02:23:06,070
簽了份文件  任命你為繼承人
signed a document naming you as her successor.

3298
02:23:06,320 --> 02:23:07,820
真的嗎
She did?

3299
02:23:07,910 --> 02:23:09,530
太好了  這是個好消息
Fantastic! Well, that's good news!

3300
02:23:09,830 --> 02:23:11,990
這個嘛  暫時還不是
Well, not as of yet.

3301
02:23:12,330 --> 02:23:14,330
什么叫做暫時還不是
What does that mean? Not as of yet?

3302
02:23:16,750 --> 02:23:18,460
我聽不清你說什么
I can't seem to hear you.

3303
02:23:18,540 --> 02:23:21,250
這里的信號太差了  你在說英文嗎
I must have bad reception. Are you speaking English?

3304
02:23:21,420 --> 02:23:24,090
-快  現在  快動身  -快
- Very... Now. Fast. Very fast. - Fast?

3305
02:23:24,170 --> 02:23:26,300
我要現在就動身去瑞士嗎
I have to get to Switzerland now?

3306
02:23:28,010 --> 02:23:30,100
說英語  給老子說英語
Speak English! Fucking speak English!

3307
02:23:30,180 --> 02:23:31,470
安靜點  讓我講完
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey. Hey! Quiet, okay?

3308
02:23:31,560 --> 02:23:34,380
帶上西裝  帶上小雞雞  給我滾過來
Take your suit, take your dick, okay, and move your ass! Please.

3309
02:23:35,540 --> 02:23:36,890
好的  我立刻過去
Okay. Move my ass! Yes!

3310
02:23:36,980 --> 02:23:41,110
我得說  這些瑞士人真夠狡猾
I gotta say, these Swiss were some sneaky motherfuckers.

3311
02:23:41,190 --> 02:23:43,110
就在幾分鐘內  他找到了一個
Within minutes, he had me set up with a forger

3312
02:23:43,190 --> 02:23:45,190
可以偽造艾瑪姑姑簽名的人
who could fake Aunt Emma's signature.

3313
02:23:45,280 --> 02:23:46,820
你個美國廢物
You American shit!

3314
02:23:46,990 --> 02:23:50,370
我必須明天前到那里  否則損失兩千萬
I just had to get there by tomorrow, or lose $20 million.

3315
02:23:50,450 --> 02:23:52,160
我們要去摩納哥

3316
02:23:52,700 --> 02:23:55,000
-摩納哥  現在嗎  -是的  寶貝

3317
02:23:55,080 --> 02:23:57,670
我們先去摩納哥  然后去瑞士
We're going to Monaco, so then we can go to Switzerland, okay?

3318
02:23:57,750 --> 02:23:59,460
-但是她的姑姑剛去世  -我知道
- But her aunt just died. - I realize that.

3319

3321
02:24:02,550 --> 02:24:04,630
就這樣定了  抱歉
Bottom line. Sorry.

3322
02:24:04,920 --> 02:24:06,720
我們要趕去倫敦

3323
02:24:07,220 --> 02:24:08,470

02:24:09,970 --> 02:24:11,140
要參加葬禮啊

3325
02:24:11,220 --> 02:24:12,560
寶貝  你聽我說
Yeah, but, babe. Look, look...

3326
02:24:13,060 --> 02:24:15,810
我是這世上最愛你姑姑的人
I loved your aunt more than anyone in the entire world.

3327
02:24:15,890 --> 02:24:17,390
我真的很愛她
I really did.

3328
02:24:17,890 --> 02:24:20,150
但她死了  寶貝
But she's dead now, sweetie.

3329
02:24:20,230 --> 02:24:22,440
她死了  哪都不能去
She's dead and she's not going anywhere.

3330
02:24:22,520 --> 02:24:24,900
等我們去到倫敦  她依然是死的
She'll still be dead by the time we get to London, okay?

3331
02:24:25,570 --> 02:24:27,320
泰德船長  聽好了
Captain Ted! Captain Ted, all right, look.

3332
02:24:27,400 --> 02:24:29,200
我們現在改去摩納哥  知道嗎
We're going to Monaco. Monaco now, okay?

3333
02:24:29,280 --> 02:24:30,320
摩納哥  好的
Monaco, right.

3334
02:24:30,410 --> 02:24:32,280
我們先去摩納哥  然后再轉去瑞士
We're going to Monaco so that we can drive to Switzerland

3335
02:24:32,370 --> 02:24:33,660
就能免去那些出入境手續了
so they don't stamp our passports.

3336
02:24:33,740 --> 02:24:35,620
辦完事后  我們再開回摩納哥
Take care of business here, we'll drive back to Monaco,

3337
02:24:35,700 --> 02:24:37,370
坐飛機到倫敦  參加葬禮
take a flight over to London to catch the funeral

3338
02:24:37,460 --> 02:24:38,960
三個辦事日后回到紐約

3339
02:24:39,040 --> 02:24:40,210
這就是計劃
That's the fucking plan.

3340
02:24:40,290 --> 02:24:42,670
我們可能會遇到海上風暴
I just want you to know that we might run into some chop.

3341
02:24:42,750 --> 02:24:44,960
小小的風暴  我們能搞定的吧
Chop? We can fucking handle chop, right?

3342
02:24:45,050 --> 02:24:46,460
我們的游艇足足有170英尺長
I mean, it's a 170-foot yacht.

3343
02:24:46,550 --> 02:24:47,580
不不不  我們哪兒也不去
No, no, no. We're not going

3344
02:24:47,580 --> 02:24:49,300
除非他說安全
anywhere unless he says it's safe, all right.

3345
02:24:49,380 --> 02:24:50,800
-別擔心風暴  -那很安全
- Don't worry about the chop. - It's safe.

3346
02:24:50,890 --> 02:24:52,220
你壓根就不懂什么是風暴
You don't know shit about chop.

3347
02:24:52,300 --> 02:24:54,510
就你懂  你什么時候成風暴專家了
Oh, really? And you do? You're a fucking expert on that.

3348
02:24:54,600 --> 02:24:56,930
要不我把你的信用卡額度減半  怎么樣
I'll chop your fucking credit card in half. How about that?

3349
02:24:57,020 --> 02:24:58,890
小小的風暴沒事的  相信我
Chop is fine. Trust me. Chop is fine.

3350
02:24:58,980 --> 02:25:00,690
不用擔心風暴  對吧泰德船長
Is chop fine, Captain Ted?

3351
02:25:02,020 --> 02:25:03,860
如果我們開慢點的話  就不用怕了
Yeah. I mean, if we take it slow.

3352
02:25:03,940 --> 02:25:05,110
對的  我們開慢點就好了
Yeah, we're gonna take it slow.

3353
02:25:05,190 --> 02:25:06,780
就是有點不舒適罷了  安全的
It's a little uncomfortable. Tell them it's safe.

3354
02:25:06,860 --> 02:25:08,030
還是安全的
It's gonna be safe.

3355
02:25:08,110 --> 02:25:11,700
我們把艙口封了  確保夾板安全
We'll batten down the hatches and secure the deck.

3356
02:25:11,780 --> 02:25:15,490
可能會打碎幾個碟子
And we're looking at a few... maybe a few broken dishes.

3357
02:25:15,580 --> 02:25:16,700
就打碎幾個碟子
Few broken dishes.

3358
02:25:16,790 --> 02:25:18,000
打碎幾個碟子是什么概念
What's a few broken dishes?

3359
02:25:18,080 --> 02:25:19,370
聽起來很安全嘛  不會有事的
Does that sound fucking awesome or what?

3360
02:25:19,460 --> 02:25:20,830
才不是
No. Not really.

3361
02:25:20,920 --> 02:25:22,210
我們一定會玩得很開心的
We're gonna have a fucking good time!

3362
02:25:22,290 --> 02:25:24,040
讓我們現在就出發去摩納哥
Let's go to fucking Monaco now!

3363
02:25:24,130 --> 02:25:25,290
趕緊動起來  起程吧
Let's fucking move! Let's go!

3364
02:25:30,720 --> 02:25:31,760
穩住
Hold on!

3365
02:25:34,930 --> 02:25:37,930
現在是什么情況
What the fuck is going on out here?

3366
02:25:38,020 --> 02:25:40,640
摩托艇翻倒在甲板上了
The Jet Skis just went overboard!

3367
02:25:40,730 --> 02:25:42,730
我的天啊  寶貝  你還好嗎
Oh, Jesus Christ! Honey, you okay?

3368
02:25:42,810 --> 02:25:44,940
大風警報  大風警報
Gale warning! Gale warning!

3369
02:25:45,020 --> 02:25:47,820
海浪已升至20英尺高  并持續上升
The waves are 20 feet high and building!

3370
02:25:47,900 --> 02:25:49,570
掉頭吧  我們走別的路線
Turn around, let's go the other fucking way.

3371
02:25:49,650 --> 02:25:50,860
-不行  -掉頭
- We can't! - Go!

3372
02:25:50,950 --> 02:25:53,530
現在掉頭的話  會翻船的
We'll get broad-sided. It'll tip over!

3373
02:25:53,620 --> 02:25:55,410
我是個潛水大師  你聽到嗎
I am a master diver. You hear that?

3374
02:25:55,490 --> 02:25:56,530
我是個潛水大師
I'm a master diver!

3375
02:25:56,620 --> 02:25:57,870
沒有人會死
No one's gonna fucking die!

3376
02:25:57,950 --> 02:26:00,580
有我在  寶貝  有我在  相信我
I got you, baby. I got you. Trust me, okay?

3377
02:26:00,660 --> 02:26:01,910
我愛你
I love you.

3378
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:03,920
我愛你  寶貝  抓緊了
I love you, baby. Just hold on tight.

3379
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:05,040
好的
Okay.

3380
02:26:05,130 --> 02:26:06,170
唐尼

3381
02:26:07,750 --> 02:26:08,960
堅持住  寶貝
Hold on, baby!

3382
02:26:09,050 --> 02:26:13,130
唐尼
Donnie!

3383
02:26:13,640 --> 02:26:15,010
-什么  -堅持住  寶貝
- What? - Hold on, baby.

3384
02:26:15,100 --> 02:26:16,600
把安眠酮拿來
Get the fucking ludes.

3385
02:26:16,680 --> 02:26:17,850
我不想死  喬丹
I don't wanna die, Jordan!

3386
02:26:17,930 --> 02:26:19,110
我干了那么多壞事
I did a lot of bad shit.

3387
02:26:19,110 --> 02:26:20,640
我要下地獄了  喬丹
I'm going to hell, Jordan!

3388
02:26:20,730 --> 02:26:23,600
我死定了  這次真的死定了
I fucked up! I fucked up so bad!

3389
02:26:23,690 --> 02:26:25,690
到樓下把安眠酮拿來
Get the ludes! Downstairs!

3390
02:26:25,900 --> 02:26:27,110
你說什么
What are you saying?

3391
02:26:27,610 --> 02:26:29,020
該死的
Fuck!

3392
02:26:29,900 --> 02:26:31,110
去把安眠酮拿來
Get the ludes!

3393
02:26:31,190 --> 02:26:32,780
我下不去  下面被淹了  喬丹
I can't go down there, Jordan. It's flooded.

3394
02:26:32,860 --> 02:26:34,110
下面的水有三尺深
It's three feet of water down there!

3395
02:26:34,200 --> 02:26:36,950
我不要清醒得死去
I will not die sober!

3396
02:26:37,030 --> 02:26:38,780
把那些該死的安眠酮拿來
Get those fucking ludes!

3397
02:26:38,870 --> 02:26:39,910
好的
Okay!

3398
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:41,330
-快去  -好的
- Go! - Okay.

3399
02:26:44,210 --> 02:26:45,960
-他要去哪里  -抓緊  寶貝
- Where's he going? - Hold on, baby!

3400
02:26:46,040 --> 02:26:47,630
唐尼  他瘋了嗎
Donnie! Is he fucking crazy?

3401
02:26:47,710 --> 02:26:48,840
他只是去警告其他人
He's just warning everybody!

3402
02:27:01,060 --> 02:27:02,770
天啊
Jesus Christ!

3403
02:27:04,350 --> 02:27:05,520
抓穩了
Hold on!

3404
02:27:05,600 --> 02:27:07,060
離窗戶遠點
Get away from the window!

3405
02:27:07,150 --> 02:27:08,520
大浪要打過來了
Rogue wave!

3406
02:27:08,610 --> 02:27:09,650
求救
Mayday!

3407
02:27:09,730 --> 02:27:12,320
我是內奧米號的船長泰德·比切姆
This is Captain Ted Beecham aboard the yacht Naomi!

3408
02:27:12,400 --> 02:27:13,900
-我們要沉了  -我拿到了
- We are going down! - I got 'em!

3409
02:27:14,360 --> 02:27:15,570
我拿到了
I got 'em!

3410
02:27:16,740 --> 02:27:18,280
給我一顆  緩解下情緒
Give me one for the nerves!

3411
02:27:18,370 --> 02:27:19,490
我們要沉了
We're going down!

3412
02:27:19,580 --> 02:27:21,790
求救  求救
This is a fucking Mayday!

3413
02:27:21,870 --> 02:27:23,950
我們要求立即救援
We require immediate assistance!

3414
02:27:26,210 --> 02:27:27,210
抓緊了
Hold on!

3415
02:27:27,290 --> 02:27:28,500
小心
Watch out!

3416
02:27:40,180 --> 02:27:42,720
被意大利人救起來的好處就是
The nice thing about getting rescued by Italians

3417
02:27:43,020 --> 02:27:46,560
他們會喂飽你  給你喝紅酒
is that they feed you, make you drink red wine,

3418
02:27:46,650 --> 02:27:48,600
最后還會跟你跳舞
then you get to dance.

3419
02:28:05,210 --> 02:28:06,870
你看到了嗎
Did you see that?

3420
02:28:07,290 --> 02:28:10,210
那架飛機是我叫來接我們的
That was the plane I sent to come get us.

3421
02:28:11,130 --> 02:28:14,880
你一定想不到  一只海鷗撞上了機翼
I shit you not, it exploded when a seagull flew into the engine.

3422
02:28:14,970 --> 02:28:16,970
飛機在空中爆炸  死了三個人
Three people killed.

3423
02:28:21,140 --> 02:28:22,970
你希望上帝給你指引嗎
You want a sign from God?

3424
02:28:23,060 --> 02:28:26,140
這次之后  我終于得到了指引
Well, after all this, I finally got the message.

3425
02:28:31,610 --> 02:28:35,230
你夢想過財政獨立
Do you dream of becoming financially independent

3426
02:28:35,320 --> 02:28:37,990
卻每個月都有還不完的債嗎
but struggle every month just to pay your bills?

3427
02:28:38,070 --> 02:28:40,110
你想要擁有這樣一棟房子
Would you like to own a home like this,

3428
02:28:40,120 --> 02:28:42,160
卻只能勉強付得起房租嗎
but can barely afford to pay your rent?

3429
02:28:42,240 --> 02:28:43,680
我是喬丹·貝爾福
My name is Jordan Belfort,

3430
02:28:43,680 --> 02:28:45,950
創造財富  并沒有什么秘密
and there's no secret to wealth creation.

3431
02:28:46,040 --> 02:28:48,540
無論你是誰  來自哪里
No matter who you are, no matter where you came from,

3432
02:28:48,620 --> 02:28:51,210
都可以在幾個月內
you too can become financially independent

3433
02:28:51,290 --> 02:28:53,040
實現財政獨立
in just a matter of months.

3434
02:28:53,130 --> 02:28:55,250
你需要的是一套策略
All you need is a strategy.

3435
02:28:55,340 --> 02:28:56,960
在我24歲那年
When I was 24 years old,

3436
02:28:57,050 --> 02:29:00,880
我做了個決定  我不僅要生存還要發達
I made a decision not just to survive, but to thrive.

3437
02:29:00,970 --> 02:29:03,430
一開始  我沒想過這一切會成真
At first I didn't feel like deals like these were possible.

3438
02:29:03,510 --> 02:29:06,930
但我們現在有了房子  還掙了三萬三
But we have the house and we have a $33,000 profit.

3439
02:29:07,020 --> 02:29:08,140
我現在相信了
I certainly believe now.

3440
02:29:08,230 --> 02:29:09,640
好好想想
Think about it for a second.

3441
02:29:09,730 --> 02:29:11,850
如果你沒勇氣撥打喬丹·貝爾福熱線
If you don't have the guts to attend Jordan Belfort's

3442
02:29:11,940 --> 02:29:14,110
參加他們的研討會
Straight Line Persuasion System Seminar,

3443
02:29:14,190 --> 02:29:15,770
又怎么可能創造財富呢
then how do you expect to make any money?

3444
02:29:15,860 --> 02:29:17,940
如果你想成為百萬富翁
If you want to be a millionaire someday,

3445
02:29:17,950 --> 02:29:19,610
鼓起勇氣  做個決定吧
have some guts. Make a decision.

3446
02:29:19,700 --> 02:29:20,630
喬丹·貝爾福的方案很適合我
Jordan Belfort's setup worked for me

3447
02:29:20,630 --> 02:29:22,450
因為我很努力工作
because I worked hard for it.

3448
02:29:22,530 --> 02:29:25,080
如果對你不起作用  那就證明你太懶了
And if it doesn't work for you, it's because you're lazy.

3449
02:29:25,160 --> 02:29:26,790
你只配在麥當勞工作
And you should get a job at McDonald's.

3450
02:29:26,870 --> 02:29:29,290
沒有人能在財政獨立上拖你后腿
There's nobody holding you back from financial freedom.

3451
02:29:29,370 --> 02:29:32,290
也沒有人能阻止你掙大錢
And there's nobody stopping you from making millions.

3452
02:29:32,380 --> 02:29:33,630
坐在家里  無所事事
Don't just sit at home,

3453
02:29:33,710 --> 02:29:36,340
只會讓你想要的生活與你失之交臂
or the life of your dreams will sail right past you.

3454
02:29:39,090 --> 02:29:42,720
我改變了這些人的命運  也能改變你的
I changed all these people's lives and I can change yours, too!

3455
02:29:42,800 --> 02:29:44,050
來參加我的研討會吧
So come to my seminar!

3456
02:29:44,140 --> 02:29:45,510
你夢想中的生活
The life of your dreams is only...

3457
02:29:45,600 --> 02:29:47,310
好久不見  喬丹
Good to see you again, Jordan.

3458
02:29:47,390 --> 02:29:48,470
你被逮捕了
You're under arrest!

3459
02:29:48,560 --> 02:29:50,140
開什么玩笑
You gotta be joking!

3460
02:29:51,390 --> 02:29:52,650
你別開玩笑了
You're kidding me.

3461
02:29:52,730 --> 02:29:54,310
放開我
Hey, get the fuck away from me!

3462
02:29:54,400 --> 02:29:55,650
把攝像機關了
Turn that camera off.

3463
02:29:55,730 --> 02:29:57,730
我他媽在拍宣傳片呢
I'm fucking shooting a fucking infomercial here,

3464
02:29:57,820 --> 02:29:59,190
你們這群混球
you fucking cocksucker!

3465
02:29:59,280 --> 02:30:00,990
-去你的  你個混球  -關掉攝像機
- Fuck you, you motherfucker! - Shut the fucking camera off.

3466
02:30:01,070 --> 02:30:02,820
別碰我  聽到了嗎
You don't got shit on me, you hear me!

3467
02:30:02,910 --> 02:30:03,990
都給我滾
Go fuck yourself!

3468
02:30:04,070 --> 02:30:06,450
我掙的都是老實錢  你們這群混球
I'm making an honest living, you fucking piece of shit!

3469
02:30:06,530 --> 02:30:09,500
喬丹  讓我給你點法律建議
Hey, Jordan, let me give you a little legal advice.

3470
02:30:09,580 --> 02:30:11,000
給我閉嘴
Shut the fuck up!

3471
02:30:11,080 --> 02:30:12,620
去你的  你個混球
Oh, fuck you, you fucking prick!

3472
02:30:12,710 --> 02:30:15,250
我掙的都是老實錢  你們這群混球
I'm making an honest living, you motherfucker!

3473
02:30:17,090 --> 02:30:21,170
我改過自新  成了電視名人
I clean up my act. I did rehab. I'm a TV personality.

3474
02:30:21,260 --> 02:30:24,010
兩年滴酒不沾了  卻發生這事
I'm sober for two years. And this happens!

3475
02:30:24,090 --> 02:30:26,300
魯格拉特在邁阿密被逮捕了
Rugrat goes and gets busted down in Miami.

3476
02:30:26,390 --> 02:30:27,640
我是瑞士人  不是共和黨人
I'm Swiss, I'm not communist.

3477
02:30:27,720 --> 02:30:29,390
猜猜誰也被捕了  索雷爾
And guess who the fuck with? Saurel.

3478
02:30:29,470 --> 02:30:30,520
-你要揍我嗎  -不  先生
- You gonna beat me? - No, sir.

3479
02:30:30,600 --> 02:30:32,850
我了解你們國家  你們會揍我的
Yeah, I know your country. You're gonna beat me.

3480
02:30:32,940 --> 02:30:34,690
這是什么鬼幾率
I mean, what are the fucking odds?

3481
02:30:34,770 --> 02:30:37,400
日內瓦有上萬個瑞士銀行家
There had to be 10,000 Swiss bankers in Geneva,

3482
02:30:37,480 --> 02:30:38,960
魯格拉特就找了一個
and Rugrat gets the one dumb

3483
02:30:38,960 --> 02:30:41,280

很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

3486
02:30:46,450 --> 02:30:47,660
更扯淡的是
Even more fucked was that

3487
02:30:47,740 --> 02:30:50,870
他被逮捕  跟我一點關系都沒有
he got busted for shit that had nothing to do with me.

3488
02:30:50,950 --> 02:30:52,540
跟我沒有半毛錢關系
It had nothing to fucking do with me.

3489
02:30:52,620 --> 02:30:54,580
說是一起通過海外龍舟賽

為什么啊  老天爺
Why, why, God?

3497
02:31:07,930 --> 02:31:09,390
你為什么那么殘忍
Why would you be so cruel

3498
02:31:09,470 --> 02:31:12,060
要我和一家鐵板燒連鎖餐廳

長話短說  索雷爾把我供了出來
Long story short. Saurel rats me out.

3501
02:31:18,360 --> 02:31:21,480
但他首先供出了布拉德的老婆  仙黛爾
But not before he rats out Brad's wife, Chantalle,

3502
02:31:21,570 --> 02:31:23,180

她每次去瑞士  都要跟他通奸
he'd been fucking every time she went to Switzerland!

3504
02:31:27,660 --> 02:31:30,160
-不不不  這不可能  -是的是的
- No, no, no, it's impossible. - Oui, oui, oui.

3505
02:31:32,370 --> 02:31:34,160

我恨死那只狗了
I hate that fucking dog.

3515

是啊  老了  變得毫無節制

又開始在家里隨地大小便了
Starting to shit in the house again.

3517

糟透了  兄弟
Shitty, pal.

3523

但還是能撐住的
But I'm hanging in there.

3524
02:32:38,020 --> 02:32:40,520
看看我的新腳鏈
My new piece of jewelry. Check that out.

3525
02:32:40,610 --> 02:32:42,980
不能踏出家里半步
Can't leave the house, you know?

3526
02:32:43,070 --> 02:32:45,650
都快得幽居病了
Starting to get cabin fever already.

3527
02:32:46,240 --> 02:32:47,780
該死的魯格拉特
Fucking Rugrat.

3528
02:32:48,360 --> 02:32:49,660
那帶假發的死基佬
That wig-wearing faggot.

3529
02:32:49,740 --> 02:32:51,870
就不該相信那混球  真想殺了他
I can't believe that fucking guy. I wanna kill him.

3530
02:32:51,950 --> 02:32:54,540
對天發誓  我真想掐死他
Swear to God, I want to choke him to death.

3531
02:32:54,620 --> 02:32:56,910
不負責任的賤貨
Irresponsible little prick.

3532
02:32:57,040 --> 02:32:58,080
我要告訴你一件事
I'll tell you one thing.

3533
02:33:00,460 --> 02:33:02,960
不管是誰的生日
I'm never eating at Benihana again.

3534
02:33:03,840 --> 02:33:06,000
我都不去紅花餐館吃飯了
I don't care whose birthday it is.

3535
02:33:07,420 --> 02:33:08,970
內奧米在哪  她還好吧
Where's Naomi? How's she doing?

3536
02:33:09,760 --> 02:33:11,050
在哪邊
That's her in the house there.

3537
02:33:11,140 --> 02:33:13,100
你跟她打招呼  估計她也不會理你
You could say hi, but she probably won't wave back.

3538
02:33:13,350 --> 02:33:14,970
親愛的內奧米
Naomi, sweetheart!

3539
02:33:18,430 --> 02:33:19,690
她怎么了
What's up her ass?

3540
02:33:19,770 --> 02:33:21,310
-她在生我的氣嗎  -不  你懂的
- Is she mad at me? - No, you know...

3541
02:33:21,400 --> 02:33:22,860
為了交保釋金
We probably have to mortgage the house

3542
02:33:22,940 --> 02:33:24,730
我們應該要把房子抵押了
in order to make bail.

3543
02:33:24,820 --> 02:33:26,270
或許還要賣些東西
Probably end up selling the

3544
02:33:26,270 --> 02:33:28,530
才能給律師們發工資
thing in order to pay for all the lawyers.

3545
02:33:28,610 --> 02:33:31,070
說實話  這真是一場噩夢  兄弟
It's been a nightmare, buddy, to tell you the truth.

3546
02:33:31,320 --> 02:33:33,030
要不然能怎么辦呢  對吧
What are you gonna do, right?

3547
02:33:33,830 --> 02:33:36,660
斯特拉頓才是重點  情況如何
Anyway, how's Stratton? That's more important.

3548
02:33:36,740 --> 02:33:37,830
士氣如何
How's morale?

3549
02:33:37,910 --> 02:33:40,540
現在要合法掙錢  他們都氣壞了吧
They all pissed off 'cause they have to make money legally now?

3550
02:33:40,620 --> 02:33:42,080
喬丹
Jordan.

3551
02:33:42,460 --> 02:33:44,880
我把創始人都找來了
I got the founding partners together.

3552
02:33:44,960 --> 02:33:47,380
跟他們說明了情況
I talked to them about everything.

3553
02:33:48,130 --> 02:33:49,130
有我在呢
And I got you.

3554
02:33:49,970 --> 02:33:51,550
有你在是什么意思
What do you mean, you got me?

3555
02:33:52,720 --> 02:33:55,470
房子和錢的事都別擔心  有我在
The house, money, don't worry about it. I got you.

3556
02:34:01,480 --> 02:34:03,600
-好了  -我愛你  兄弟
- All right. - I love you, buddy.

3557
02:34:03,690 --> 02:34:05,610
-我也會為你這樣做的  -我知道
- You know I'd do it for you, right? - I know.

3558
02:34:05,690 --> 02:34:07,650
-你知道的  對吧  -我知道
- You know that, right? - I know.

3559
02:34:08,650 --> 02:34:09,780
真想親遍你全身
I could fucking kiss you all over.

3560
02:34:09,860 --> 02:34:11,030
好了  夠了  夠了
All right, enough, enough.

3561
02:34:13,110 --> 02:34:14,240
想喝啤酒嗎  兄弟
You want a beer, pal?

3562
02:34:14,320 --> 02:34:15,570
你在喝什么
What are you drinking?

3563
02:34:15,660 --> 02:34:17,740
不含酒精的東西
I got this non-alcoholic shit.

3564
02:34:17,830 --> 02:34:19,040
那是什么
What's that?

3565
02:34:19,120 --> 02:34:22,120
不含酒精的啤酒
A non-alcoholic beer. It's got no alcohol.

3566
02:34:22,210 --> 02:34:24,500
-是啤酒嗎  -是的  不含酒精
- It's a beer? - Yeah, with no alcohol.

3567
02:34:25,040 --> 02:34:26,290
如果你喝多了
But if you drink enough,

3568
02:34:26,380 --> 02:34:28,300
如果你喝很多的話  還是會醉嗎
if you drink a lot, they get you fucked up?

3569
02:34:28,380 --> 02:34:30,460
不會的  不含酒精  這才是重點
No, there's no alcohol. That's the fucking point.

3570
02:34:30,550 --> 02:34:31,590
我不是科學家
I'm not a scientist.

3571
02:34:31,670 --> 02:34:32,840
不知道你在說什么
I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

3572
02:34:32,930 --> 02:34:34,510
你想喝啤酒的話  我可以給你拿
I can get you a beer if you want a fucking beer.

3573
02:34:34,640 --> 02:34:36,760
我知道  但是我不喝酒了  記得嗎
I know, but I don't drink. You remember?

3574
02:34:36,850 --> 02:34:38,060
我已經戒酒了
I don't drink anymore.

3575
02:34:38,140 --> 02:34:40,600
你想進屋里吸點發酵粉嗎
Oh, you wanna go inside and blow some lines of baking powder?

3576
02:34:40,680 --> 02:34:41,850
或者是蘇打粉
Or baking soda.

3577
02:34:42,640 --> 02:34:44,940
無法想象再也不能嗑嗨的日子啊
Can't imagine ever not enjoying getting fucked up.

3578
02:34:45,020 --> 02:34:46,440
-是啊  -我愛死那些日子了
- Yeah. - I love it.

3579
02:34:46,520 --> 02:34:48,070
戒酒的日子怎樣
How's being sober?

3580
02:34:48,150 --> 02:34:49,980
-糟糕透了  -很無聊  對吧
- Fucking sucks. - Boring, right?

3581
02:34:50,070 --> 02:34:52,490
無聊到我想自殺了
So boring. I wanna kill myself.

3582
02:34:53,030 --> 02:34:55,570
有個詞  我們不太想用
There's a term, and we don't like to use it

3583
02:34:55,660 --> 02:34:57,120
除非在特殊情況下
unless circumstances dictate,

3584
02:34:57,200 --> 02:34:59,160
我認為這個案子夠特殊的了
and I think they do dictate in this case,

3585
02:34:59,240 --> 02:35:00,660
那個詞就是  格林納達
and the term is "Grenada."

3586
02:35:00,750 --> 02:35:02,290
你聽說過格林納達嗎
Have you ever heard of Grenada?

3587
02:35:02,370 --> 02:35:03,410
沒聽過
No. No, I haven't.

3588
02:35:03,540 --> 02:35:07,040
格林納達是個很有趣的小島國
Grenada's very interesting because it is a small island nation

3589
02:35:07,130 --> 02:35:10,670
1983年的時候被美國侵略
that was invaded by the United States of America in 1983.

3590
02:35:10,760 --> 02:35:12,840
大約有九萬人
It's about 90,000 people.

3591
02:35:12,920 --> 02:35:15,180
換句話說
And essentially, it means

3592
02:35:15,930 --> 02:35:17,930
這個案子我們不可能輸
this case is unloseable.

3593
02:35:18,010 --> 02:35:19,100
懂嗎
Okay?

3594
02:35:19,180 --> 02:35:20,040
也就是說
So, you know,

3595
02:35:20,040 --> 02:35:22,680
就算我們光著褲子走上法庭
we can come in, we can have our dick hanging out of our pants.

3596
02:35:22,770 --> 02:35:23,930
也沒有人會在乎
Nobody gives a fuck.

3597
02:35:24,020 --> 02:35:25,560
我贏定了
I'm gonna win.

3598
02:35:25,730 --> 02:35:27,100
而你呢
You, sir,

3599
02:35:28,650 --> 02:35:32,610
就是格林納達
are what's known as a Grenada.

3600
02:35:35,740 --> 02:35:38,070
你就等著判刑吧
You're looking at real prison time.

3601
02:35:39,240 --> 02:35:41,580
洗錢至少要吃20年牢飯
Money laundering can get you as much as 20 years.

3602
02:35:42,580 --> 02:35:45,250
如果不是抓到你往海外塞錢
And our case couldn't be stronger if we caught you

3603
02:35:45,330 --> 02:35:47,000
這案子也不會那么簡單
shoving cash in your mattress.

3604
02:35:47,080 --> 02:35:48,130
真的嗎
Is that right?

3605
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:51,420
喬丹
Hey, Jordan. Jordan.

3606
02:35:52,130 --> 02:35:55,970
你要在牢里等死  直到孩子大學畢業
Your rotting away in jail till your kids get out of college,

3607
02:35:56,050 --> 02:35:57,680
那并不是我們的目的
that's not our ambition here.

3608
02:35:59,100 --> 02:36:01,640
還有其他人參與洗錢的勾當
There's other people involved in this, too.

3609
02:36:01,720 --> 02:36:04,850
我們認為他們也應該被送上法庭
We think they need to see their day in court as well.

3610
02:36:07,440 --> 02:36:09,480
我怎么覺得你們是要提條件呢
Why do I sense there's an offer in the air?

3611
02:36:09,560 --> 02:36:12,230
你看他多聰明  你是心靈感應大師嗎
Look at him. He's got a sense. What are you, Kreskin?

3612
02:36:13,440 --> 02:36:16,190
全面配合  也就是過去七年間
Full cooperation. He provides us with a comprehensive list

3613
02:36:16,280 --> 02:36:18,660
所有同謀的詳細名單提供給我們
of all the co-conspirators spanning the last seven years,

3614
02:36:18,740 --> 02:36:20,700
還要同意帶竊聽器
and he also agrees to wear a wire.

3615
02:36:20,780 --> 02:36:22,030
等會
Wait...

3616
02:36:22,120 --> 02:36:23,870
你剛才說讓我"帶竊聽器"嗎
did you just say "wear a wire"?

3617
02:36:23,950 --> 02:36:25,200
竊聽器
A wire.

3618
02:36:25,290 --> 02:36:26,660
什么意思
What does that mean?

3619
02:36:26,750 --> 02:36:28,580
你想讓我告密  是嗎
You want me to rat? Is that it?

3620
02:36:28,670 --> 02:36:29,960
不  我想讓你合作
No, I want you to cooperate.

3621
02:36:30,040 --> 02:36:30,960
不  你就是想讓我告密
No. You want me to rat, right?

3622
02:36:30,960 --> 02:36:31,960
沒錯  就是讓你告密
Yes. We want you to rat.

3623
02:36:32,050 --> 02:36:35,880
我們還就他媽的想讓你干這件事  告密
That's fucking exactly what we want you to do. To rat.

3624
02:36:39,970 --> 02:36:41,800
克里斯蒂的派對怎么樣
How was Cristy's party?

3625
02:36:41,890 --> 02:36:42,970
不錯
Fine.

3626
02:36:43,060 --> 02:36:44,430
那就好
Good.

3627
02:36:45,600 --> 02:36:48,060
寶貝  我今天又去見過律師了
Babe, I spoke to the lawyers again today.

3628
02:36:48,140 --> 02:36:50,810
我有非常非常好的消息要告訴你
I have some really, really great news.

3629
02:36:52,650 --> 02:36:55,190
看來這件事完全不會涉及到你  親愛的
Turns out you're completely off the hook, honey.

3630
02:36:56,150 --> 02:36:57,820
這我早就知道
I know that already.

3631
02:36:57,900 --> 02:36:59,400
沒錯  也是
Right. Exactly.

3632
02:36:59,490 --> 02:37:02,700
你本來也就沒做過什么錯事  對吧
You never did anything wrong in the first place, right?

3633
02:37:03,660 --> 02:37:05,870
鬧了半天  聯邦調查局
It turns out, all the FBI really

3634
02:37:06,540 --> 02:37:10,210
真正想讓我做的就是跟他們合作
wants from me is to cooperate.

3635
02:37:10,460 --> 02:37:11,670
你知道嗎
You know?

3636
02:37:11,750 --> 02:37:12,710
因為我手上掌握了很多
Turns out I have so much

3637
02:37:12,710 --> 02:37:14,750
關于股票市場和華爾街的內幕
information about the stock market and Wall Street,

3638
02:37:14,840 --> 02:37:16,630
我可以給政府省好幾年的心
I could save the government years of heartache,

3639
02:37:16,710 --> 02:37:19,340
更別提數以百萬的經濟損失了
not to mention countless dollars.

3640
02:37:20,840 --> 02:37:23,180
但是更好的還在后頭呢  寶貝
But it gets even better, babe.

3641
02:37:23,640 --> 02:37:26,180
如果我決定跟他們合作的話
Because if I do decide to cooperate,

3642
02:37:26,560 --> 02:37:29,390
我只能只需要蹲個短短四年就行了
I might only be looking at four short years,

3643
02:37:29,480 --> 02:37:30,940
這樣一來
in which case, you know,

3644
02:37:31,020 --> 02:37:34,060
我們可以重新來過  也許把房子賣了
we could start fresh, maybe sell the house.

3645
02:37:34,150 --> 02:37:35,770
我要交的任何罰款
And any fines that I'd have to pay

3646
02:37:35,860 --> 02:37:37,650
也是等到我刑滿出獄后才用交
wouldn't be due till after I serve my term,

3647
02:37:37,740 --> 02:37:40,030
所以我們還會剩下很多錢
so we'd still have plenty of money left over, you know?

3648
02:37:42,700 --> 02:37:45,120
當然了  唯一讓我有點不爽的就是
The only thing that of course bummed me out a little bit

3649
02:37:45,200 --> 02:37:46,830
他們想讓我
is this whole idea of

3650
02:37:46,830 --> 02:37:50,250
提供關于我朋友的信息
having to give information about my friends.

3651
02:37:50,330 --> 02:37:53,540
你不是說過"華爾街上無朋友"嗎
Like you said, "There's no friends on Wall Street." Right?

3652
02:37:53,630 --> 02:37:55,590
是的  是的  沒錯
Right. Right. Exactly.

3653
02:37:55,670 --> 02:37:57,250
這件事也有好的一面  親愛的
There's a silver lining to that, too, honey.

3654
02:37:57,340 --> 02:37:59,010
因為他們說最終
Because they said eventually...

3655
02:37:59,090 --> 02:38:00,020
最終所有人
eventually everyone's

3656
02:38:00,020 --> 02:38:01,970
都必須提供關于這個案件的信息
gonna have to give information on this case.

3657
02:38:02,050 --> 02:38:03,150
所以到了最后
So, at the end of the day,

3658
02:38:03,150 --> 02:38:04,850
我告密的事也不算什么了
it might not even be a factor. You know?

3659
02:38:04,930 --> 02:38:07,060
這是好消息  對吧
Well, that's good news. Right?

3660
02:38:07,180 --> 02:38:08,890
沒錯  沒錯
Yeah, yeah.

3661
02:38:08,980 --> 02:38:10,680
我真為你高興
I'm really happy for you.

3662
02:38:12,060 --> 02:38:15,310
什么叫為我高興啊  親愛的
What do you mean, happy for me, sweetheart?

3663
02:38:16,230 --> 02:38:18,820
你應該為咱倆高興啊  對吧
You should be happy for the both of us. Right?

3664
02:38:18,900 --> 02:38:20,860
-沒錯  -好的
- Yeah, right. - All right.

3665
02:38:22,950 --> 02:38:24,570
過來  寶貝
Come here, baby.

3666
02:38:25,070 --> 02:38:26,620
親親我  甜心
Give me a kiss, sweetheart.

3667
02:38:26,700 --> 02:38:27,700
喬丹
Jordan...

3668
02:38:27,790 --> 02:38:28,990
來吧  寶貝
Oh, come on, baby.

3669
02:38:29,080 --> 02:38:31,290
我都好久沒跟你做愛了  求你了
I haven't made love to you in so long. Please.

3670
02:38:31,370 --> 02:38:33,790
-喬丹  不要  -親愛的  求你了
- No. Jordan, stop it. - Come on, honey, please.

3671
02:38:33,880 --> 02:38:35,290
不要  喬丹  夠了
No! Jordan, stop it!

3672
02:38:37,040 --> 02:38:39,250
我第一眼看到你就愛上你了
I've loved you since the moment I saw you.

3673
02:38:43,130 --> 02:38:45,010
我他媽的恨死你了  喬丹
I fucking hate you, Jordan.

3674
02:38:45,600 --> 02:38:48,140
-給我下去  -寶貝  別這樣
- Get off me! - Baby... don't do that.

3675
02:38:49,020 --> 02:38:50,930
你知道我有多愛你  對吧
You know how much I love you, right?

3676
02:38:51,430 --> 02:38:53,600
別這樣對我了  親愛的  求你了
Stop that, sweetie. Please.

3677
02:38:58,860 --> 02:39:00,900
你想上我嗎  喬丹

我要你狠狠地上我
I want you to fuck me real hard.

02:39:13,960 --> 02:39:16,630
我要你把這當成是最后一次一樣操我
I want you to fuck me like it's the last fucking time.

3684

我是說  剛才那就是我們的最后一次了
I mean that was the last time we ever have sex.

3709
02:40:14,810 --> 02:40:16,850
你在說什么呀
What are you talking about?

3710
02:40:18,850 --> 02:40:20,520
我要離婚
I want a divorce.

3711
02:40:22,110 --> 02:40:24,110
你這是什么意思  你要離婚
What do you mean, you want a divorce?

3712
02:40:24,190 --> 02:40:26,240
你在說什么啊  你要離婚
What's that supposed to mean, you want a divorce?

3713
02:40:26,320 --> 02:40:28,200
放開我  我要跟你離婚
Get off me! I want a divorce.

3714
02:40:28,530 --> 02:40:29,780
你剛剛才跟我上完床
You just made love to me.

3715
02:40:29,870 --> 02:40:30,950
你他媽的是什么毛病啊
What the fuck is wrong with you?

3716
02:40:31,030 --> 02:40:33,370
我不愛你了  喬丹
I don't love you anymore, Jordan!

3717
02:40:34,660 --> 02:40:36,620
你不愛我了
Oh, you don't love me?

3718
02:40:37,040 --> 02:40:38,620
你已經不愛我了
You don't love me anymore, huh?

3719
02:40:38,710 --> 02:40:40,960
你還真會挑時候啊
Well, isn't that just fucking convenient for you!

3720
02:40:41,040 --> 02:40:42,880
我現在被聯邦政府起訴
Now that I'm under federal indictment,

3721
02:40:42,960 --> 02:40:44,920
腳脖子上還綁著個電子監控器
with an electronic bracelet around my ankle,

3722
02:40:45,010 --> 02:40:46,720
然后你他媽的決定不愛我了
now you decide you don't fucking love me anymore.

3723
02:40:46,800 --> 02:40:48,550
-是嗎  -不  不
- Is that right? - No, no.

3724
02:40:48,880 --> 02:40:51,140
你到底是什么人啊  說啊
What kind of person are you? Tell me.

3725
02:40:51,220 --> 02:40:52,470
是你娶的我
You married me!

3726
02:40:52,560 --> 02:40:54,060
你這話是他媽的什么意思
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

3727
02:40:54,140 --> 02:40:55,810
喬丹  接下來這么安排
Jordan, this is how it's gonna go.

3728
02:40:55,890 --> 02:40:58,060
孩子的監護權歸我
I'm gonna take custody of the kids.

3729
02:40:58,140 --> 02:41:01,690
你同意離婚  我還可以讓你探望孩子
If you agree to the divorce right now, I will allow visitation.

3730
02:41:01,810 --> 02:41:03,650
-好嗎  你別想著跟我爭  -天啊
- Okay? Don't try to fight it. - Oh, my God.

3731
02:41:03,730 --> 02:41:05,250
我們好聚好散  也能給咱倆省點錢
It'll save us both a lot of money

3732
02:41:05,260 --> 02:41:07,900
而且我覺得你以后用錢的地方還多著呢
and I got a feeling you're gonna need it.

3733
02:41:09,450 --> 02:41:12,660
你別想帶走我的孩子  親愛的
You're not taking my kids, sweetheart. You hear me?

3734
02:41:12,740 --> 02:41:14,160
我已經找律師問過了
I've already talked to the lawyer.

3735
02:41:14,240 --> 02:41:15,490
他說就算你不被定罪
He said even if you don't get convicted,

3736
02:41:15,580 --> 02:41:16,660
孩子的監護權歸我的可能性也很大
I've got a good chance of getting them.

3737
02:41:16,750 --> 02:41:17,830
我告訴你
I got news for you.

3738
02:41:17,910 --> 02:41:19,820
你他媽的別想帶走我的孩子
You're not fucking taking my children,

3739
02:41:19,830 --> 02:41:21,330
你這個惡毒的蕩婦

02:41:43,360 --> 02:41:44,730
該死的雞
Fucking whore!

3746
02:41:49,110 --> 02:41:51,780
他媽的臭婊子  該死的雞
Fucking bitch! Piece of shit fucking whore!

3747
02:42:00,960 --> 02:42:03,710
看看你的德行  喬丹
Look at yourself, Jordan.

3748
02:42:03,790 --> 02:42:04,960
你變態
You're sick!

3749
02:42:05,040 --> 02:42:06,210
你就是個變態
You're a sick man!

3750
02:42:06,300 --> 02:42:08,340
操你  我告訴你  你別想帶走孩子
Fuck you! I told you, you're not taking my fucking kids!

3751
02:42:08,420 --> 02:42:10,880
你認為我會讓我的孩子待在你身邊嗎
You think I would let my kids near you?

3752
02:42:10,970 --> 02:42:12,130
看看你這個德行
Look at yourself!

3753
02:42:12,220 --> 02:42:13,720
你知道我的律師怎么說嗎
You know what my lawyer said?

3754
02:42:13,800 --> 02:42:17,260
我律師說你要蹲二十年大牢  喬丹
My lawyer said that you're going to prison for 20 years, Jordan.

3755
02:42:17,350 --> 02:42:20,600
二十年啊  你別打算再見到孩子了
Twenty fucking years! You're never gonna see the kids again!

3756
02:42:20,680 --> 02:42:21,890
你以為我再也見不到……
You don't think I'm not gonna see my...

3757
02:42:21,980 --> 02:42:23,730
不  我才不會讓你接近我的孩子呢
No, I'm not fucking letting you near my kids!

3758
02:42:23,810 --> 02:42:25,980
你以為我再也見不到我自己的孩子了
You don't think I'm gonna see my fucking kids again, huh?

3759
02:42:26,070 --> 02:42:27,610
你他媽的別碰他們
Don't you fucking touch them!

3760
02:42:28,940 --> 02:42:30,740
你他媽的別碰我
Don't you fucking touch me!

3761
02:42:32,450 --> 02:42:35,700
寶貝  爸爸帶你出去玩  好嗎
Sweetheart? You're coming on a trip with Daddy, all right?

3762
02:42:35,780 --> 02:42:37,740
你要跟爸爸出去玩了
You're coming on a trip with Daddy.

3763

你別他媽的碰她  喬丹
Don't you fucking touch her, Jordan.

3764
02:42:42,830 --> 02:42:45,580
我對天發誓  我他媽的會宰了你的
I swear to God, I will fucking kill you!

3765
02:42:48,250 --> 02:42:49,500

It's all right, baby.

3766
