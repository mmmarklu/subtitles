希斯路
全金屬婊子

在我一靴子踢爆你個窩囊廢的菊花前 就應該
It's how I address a slack-jawed recruit before I bust his hole
這麼稱呼像你這種傻逼新兵!
with my boot heel, maggot!
等一下 軍士
Hold up there, sergeant.
我能效勞嗎 長官?

不 長官 你不像
No, sir, you do not.
我是威廉·凱奇少校
My name is Major William Cage.
- 我是名美國軍官  - 軍官?
- I'm an American officer.  - Officer?
這兒是處理部
This is processing.
這裏沒有軍官 交給我吧 軍士
There's no officers down here. I got this, sergeant.
你怎麼落到處理部來了?
How the hell did you end up in processing?
究竟為何? 賭牌? 單身派對?
What was it? Poker night? Bachelor party?
要是你不介意的話 軍士長...
If it's all the same to you, sergeant...
我想解釋給在華盛頓的上司聽
I'd like to explain that to my commanding officer in Washington.

I've been railroaded.
很明顯 我不該在這裏
It's obvious I don't belong here.
所以拜託了 軍士長 一定有辦法讓我打個電話
So please, sergeant, there has to be a way I can make a phone call.
我會幫你安排的 長官
I'll get you sorted out, sir.

你是肯塔基哪裏人 軍士長?

一個叫科學山的小鎮 聽過沒?
Little town called Science Hill. Heard of it?
現在聽過了
I have now.
- 你呢 你是哪裏人?  - 紅莓市 新澤西州
- How about you, where you from?  - Cranbury, New Jersey.
那裏盛產紅莓嗎?
They grow a lot of cranberries there do they?
西紅柿 特別好
Tomatoes. Best you ever had.
為什麼叫它紅莓市呢?
Why they call it Cranberry, then?
為什麼叫你那科學山?
Why they call it Science Hill?
從沒問過 我不在乎
Never asked. Don't care.
請吧
After you.
你沒打算帶我找電話 是不是 軍士長?
You're not taking me to a phone, are you sergeant?
我是沒打算
No, I am not.
看起來你說過的唯一一句實話就只有你的名字
Seems about the only honest thing you said to me so far is your name.
這上說你是逃兵
Says here you're a deserter.
說你冒充軍官時被逮捕 說你...
It says here you were caught impersonating an officer. It says here...
很可能嘗試與外界聯絡 甚至連累到整個計劃的安危
you'd likely try to make an outside call, even compromise security of this operation.
只為了明天能不用參戰
Anything to get out of combat duty tomorrow.
可是你不會得逞
But that's not gonna happen.

二等兵凱奇

等太陽一落 這些人就會得出同一個結論:

Private Kimmel, what is my view of gambling in the barracks?
你不喜歡 法瑞軍士長
You dislike it, Sergeant Farell.
南希 我為什麼不喜歡它?
Nance, why do I dislike it?
因為賭博是把自己的命運寄托在他人手裏
It entertains the notion our fate is in hands other than our own.
我對命運二字是何立場 一起來?
And what is my definitive position on the concept of fate, chorus?
時刻準備 嚴守紀律 主宰自己的命運
Through readiness and discipline, we are masters of our fate.
你可能會覺得諷刺
You might call that notion ironic.
但相信我 你會懂的
But trust me, you'll come around.

我要你們親自為他的救贖負責

明早六點 他將做好戰鬥的準備
He will be combat ready at 0600 tomorrow.
戰鬥準備?
Combat ready?
二等兵凱奇錯以為他不屬於這兒
Private Cage is under the delusion he does not belong here.
我們必須糾正這個錯覺
We must dissuade him of this delusion.
要是他想逃 請隨意糾正他 打得他站不起來為止
If he tries to run, feel free to dissuade him until he can't piss standing up.
軍士長 聽我說
Sergeant, you have to listen to me.
- 我永遠不會做好戰鬥準備  - 我真羨慕你 凱奇
- I will never be combat ready.  - I envy you, Cage.
明天一早 你就會被洗禮 煥然一新
Tomorrow morning, you will be baptized. Born again.
跑步! 十分鐘!

可是那一天要是來了 我照樣搞定
You can bet when that day comes, I'll make it work.
奇莫
Kimmel.

我是比爾·凱奇上校 我是美軍媒體公關
My name is Major Bill Cage. I'm U.S. Army Media Relations.
我沒去單身派對 也沒打牌
I was not at a bachelor party or a poker game.
你接到命令 說我是個假扮長官的逃兵
You have an order that says I'm a deserter caught impersonating an officer.
但我還知道...
But what it doesn't say is...
你是法瑞軍士長 家鄉在肯塔基州的科學山
your name is Master Sergeant Farell from Science Hill, Kentucky.
如果能聽我講三十秒

奇莫馬上就要贏了 是梅花... 不 方塊
Kimmel's working on a flush. Spades... no, clubs.
你會讓他們把牌吃掉
You're gonna make them eat those cards.
我說得對吧?
Am I right?
現在...
Now...
我想說的可能有些不可思議
what I'm about to tell you sounds crazy.
但都是真的
It's true.
你們一定要相信我
And you have to listen to me.
與你們的命運息息相關
Your very lives depend on it.
還有一分鐘!

那不是軍官的制服嗎?
Isn't that an officer's uniform?
- 那可不是...  - 軍官該帶的袖扣啊
- Those sure...  - These sure ain't officer's cufflinks.
鑰匙... 在左邊口袋裏
Keys in the... left pocket, probably.
凱奇是個逃兵
Private Cage is a deserter.
我要你們親自為他的救贖負責
I'm making you all personally responsible for his deliverance.
明早六點 他將做好戰鬥的準備

二等兵凱奇錯以為他不屬於這兒
Private Cage is under the delusion he does not belong here.
我們必須糾正這個錯覺
We must dissuade him of this delusion.
- 要是他想逃 請隨意糾正他...  - 不 我沒想逃跑
- If he tries to run, feel free to dissuade him...  - Oh, no. I'm not gonna run.

禁止穿越

Excuse me. Sergeant Vrataski.
打擾一下
Excuse me.
維塔斯基中士?
Sergeant Vrataski?
不好意思
Excuse me.
怎麼回事? 誰讓你過來的?
Yes? Who said you could talk to me?
我臉上有什麼東西嗎?
Have I got something on my face?
是你說的 你說的
You did. You did.
明天 在沙灘上
Tomorrow. At the beach.
明天 在沙灘上
Tomorrow. At the beach.
我們見到了
We meet.
你說我醒來就去找你
You said to find you when I wake up.
你知道我身上發生了什麼
You do know what's happening to me.
跟我來
Come with me.
現在
Now.
除了我你不要跟別人說這個
You don't talk to anyone about this but me.
最好的情況是你在精神病院度過下半生
The best-case scenario is you're gonna end up in a psych ward.
最差的情況 你會被切成塊送去研究 明白嗎?
Worst case, you'll get dissected for study. Are we clear?
- 明白嗎?  - 明白
- Yes?  - Yes.
你第一次死的時候 發生什麼了?
First time you died, what happened?
- 你殺了一個模仿者?  - 對
- You killed a mimic?  - Yes.
- 具體描述下  - 那個不一樣
- Describe it.  - It was different.
它更大一點 有點藍
It was bigger. Bluish.
然後你沾上了它的血
And you got covered in its blood.
對啊 是沾上了
As a matter of fact, I did.
他們知道明天我們去沙灘
They know we're coming on the beach tomorrow.
簡直是屠殺 不是嗎?
It's a slaughter, isn't it?
你這麼知道的?
How do you know this?
你就不能...? 等等!
Could you just...? Wait!
等等 等等
Wait. Wait.
你能不能跟我解釋下到底發生了什麼
Would you explain to me what the hell is happening.
你經歷的事我也經歷過
What happened to you happened to me.
我曾經也有 但是我失去了 滿意了?
I had it. I lost it. Okay?
太好了 那肯定能治好 我怎麼才能不這樣?
That's great. There's a cure. How do I get rid of this?
首先 我需要你的幫助
First, I need your help.
到底幫什麼?
Help with what exactly?
贏得戰爭
Winning the war.
走吧! 走!
Let's go! Come on!
芮塔 這是什麼?
Rita, what is this?
你在這裏做什麼? 你得提前告訴我
What are you doing here? You gotta give me some warning.
- 這是誰?  - 他就是我 在凡爾登戰役之前
- Who's this?  - He's me. Before Verdun.
他能幫我們
He's gonna help us.
什麼? 你是說他...?
What? You mean he's...?
沒錯
Yes.
他什麼時候死的? 在哪裏?
When did he die? Where?
沙灘上 明天
On the beach. Tomorrow.
我有多少只手指抵著後背?
How many fingers am I holding up behind my back?
我怎麼會知道?
How should I know that?
好吧
Okay.
所以這是我們第一次這樣對話
So this is the first time we've had this conversation.
- 你應該在他身上試試這個  - 那是什麼鬼東西?
- You should try this on him.  - What the hell is that?
沒用
It doesn't work.
他能看到嗎?
Has he had any visions yet?
看到什麼?
Visions of what?
還需要時間
There's still time.
- 對  - 時間? 聽著 不好意思
- Yes.  - Time? Look, I'm sorry.
這是誰? 你是誰?
Who is this? Who are you?
我是卡特博士 粒子物理學 高級微生物學
I'm Dr. Carter. Particle physics. Advanced microbiology.
他也是唯一另一個會相信你身上發生的事的人
He's also the only other person who'll believe what's happening to you.
沒人比他更懂模仿者生物學
No one understands mimic biology better than him.
他是政府最頂尖的分析家
He's a top analyst at Whitehall.
我說 那是在我遇見芮塔之前 現在 我就只是...
Well, I mean, I was until I met Rita and now I'm just...
一個"精神錯亂的技工"
a "mechanic with psychiatric delusions."
卡特
Carter.
給他看看
Show him.
對 好吧
Yeah, right.
好了 首先...
Right. Well, first of all...
你不在和軍隊作戰
you're not fighting an army.
你得把這個想像成一個單一有機體
You have to think of this as a single organism.
現在 這些常見的無人機 就像它的爪子
Now, these common drones, they act like its claws.
阿爾法 就像你殺掉的那只 更少見
And Alphas, like the one that you killed, are much more rare.
對 他們出現的幾率...
Yeah. They're like one in...
- 是618萬分之一 我猜測  - 沒錯
- 6.18 million, by my guess.  - Yes.
他們作為敵人的...
They act as the enemy's...
他們就像它的中央神經系統
They're like its central nervous system.
但這...
But this...
是大腦
is the brain.
它控制了所有生物 這是歐米加
It controls them all. And this is the Omega.
歐米加能控制時間
And the Omega has the ability to control time.
無論阿爾法何時被殺...
Whenever an Alpha is killed...
就會觸發一個自動反應
an automatic response is triggered.
歐米加會重新開始之前的那一天
The Omega starts the day over again.
但你看 這次 它能記住要發生什麼 就像你這樣
But you see, this time, it can remember what's going to happen just like you do.
它在我們之前知道我們要做什麼
It knows exactly what we're gonna do before we're gonna do it.
- 知道未來的敵人不可能會輸  - 它不會輸
- And an enemy that knows the future can't lose.  - It can't lose.
但如果這是真的 你們怎麼贏的凡爾登?
But if that's true, how did you win at Verdun?
他們讓我們贏的
We were allowed to win.
這東西想讓我們相信我們能贏
This thing wants us to believe we can win.
它想讓我們把一切我們擁有的都投入這場侵略戰爭
It wants us to throw everything we have into the invasion.
滅亡行動不是我們的勝利之戰 而是敵人的
Operation Downfall isn't our endgame it's the enemy's.
你要知道的是 這是一個完美進化的...
The thing you've got to understand is this is a perfectly evolved...
征服世界的有機體
world-conquering organism.
就我們所知 有數百萬那樣的小行星...
For all we know, there are millions of those asteroids...
漂浮在宇宙中 就像病毒
floating around in the cosmos like a virus.
他們就在等著有合適環境的星球 然後撞過去
They're just waiting to crash-land into a world with just the right conditions.
它們需要的就是讓星球上的主宰物種來進攻
All they need is for the dominant life form to attack and
然後就沒有任何事物能阻止它們...
There'll be nothing to stop the mimics...
征服剩下的世界
from conquering the rest of the world.
除非你能改變結果
Unless you change the outcome.
我?
Me?
你殺了那只阿爾法之後 你一不小心就進入了敵人的神經系統
When you killed that Alpha, you inadvertently entered the enemy's nervous system.
凱奇 你已經掌握了歐米加的能力 能重新開始一天
Cage, you've seized control of the Omega's ability to reset the day.
- 那怎麼可能?  - 或許這個有機體的...
- How's that even possible? - Perhaps this organism's...
唯一弱點 它的唯一弱點...
only vulnerability, its only vulnerability...
就是人性
is humanity.
無論怎樣 你現在就掌控了這個能力
Regardless of that, you control the power now.
就如我在凡爾登中一樣
Just as I did in Verdun.
所以我在重新開始這一天?
So I'm resetting the day?
好吧
Okay.
我怎麼控制呢?
How do I control it?
你必須得死
You have to die.
每一天
Every day.
直到歐米加被摧毀
Until the Omega's destroyed.
首先...
First of all...
這是一個非常棒的演示
this is a terrific presentation.
非常棒
Terrific.
我認識將軍
I know the general.
我們應該告訴他
We should take this to him.
- 你就告訴他你告訴我的一切  - 我去見過將軍 凱奇
- You just tell him everything you told me.  - I went to see the general, Cage.
無數次
Any number of times.
精神病院 切成塊 記得嗎?
Psych ward. Dissection. Remember?
你們希望我做什麼?
What are you expecting from me?
你見過任何奇怪的事嗎?
Have you seen anything strange?
他玩我呢?
Is he shitting me?
景象
Visions.
景象 你有看到任何景像嗎?
Visions. Have you seen any visions like that?
當歐米加發現它對它的能力開始失去掌控 它就會發現
The Omega senses when it's losing control of its power.
即使現在 它也在精神上搜索你
Even now it's mentally searching to find you.
它快找到你的時候 你就開始能看到未來
When it's close to finding you you will start having visions.
- 你會看到那個的  - 你甚至會看到它在哪裏
- You'll start to see that.  - You'll even see where it is.
你曾經能看到?
And you had these visions?
對
Yes.
但最後你看到了它 我是說 你真的看到了它
But eventually you saw it. I mean, you actually saw it.
是嗎?
Right?
從未見過實體
Never in the flesh.
所以這都只是...
So this is all just some...
理論
theory.
你根本不知道這玩意兒到底存不存在
You don't know if this thing even exists.
景象告訴我它曾經在凡爾登 我能看到它 我...
The visions showed me it was at Verdun. I could see it. I...
我就...
I just...
在我找到它之前就失去了我的能力
lost the power before I could get to it.
到我們奪下凡爾登時
And by the time we took Verdun...
歐米加已經走了
the Omega was gone.
好吧 那麼我要做的就是... 等著這些景象出現...
Okay. So all I have to do is... wait to have these visions...
然後告訴你這個叫歐米加的玩意兒在哪裏
and then tell you where this Omega thing is.
不是 凱奇
No. Cage.
你要帶我去那裏 然後我會殺了它
You're gonna get me there. And I'm gonna kill it.
帶你去那裏?
Get you there?
我甚至都沒接受過戰鬥訓練
I'm not even trained for combat.
重裝
Reload.
重裝
Reload.
你沒事吧 凱奇?
Are you all right, Cage?
我想我受傷了
I think I broke something.
什麼?
What?
我的背
My back.
我能唯一感受到的就是我的嘴唇
The only thing I can feel are my lips.
現在仔細聽好 這是很重要的規則
Now listen carefully. This is a very important rule.
這是唯一的規則
This is the only rule.
如果你在戰場上受傷 你最好確保你死掉
You get injured on the field, you better make sure you die.
為什麼?
Why?
上次我在戰場...
Last time I was in combat...
我受傷了
I was hit.
我在流血 但流血速度不夠快
I was bleeding out. Just not fast enough.
我在戰地醫院裏醒來...
I woke up in a field hospital...
被輸了別人的三品脫血 然後就完了
with three pints of someone else's blood and I was out.
我失去了能力 你明白嗎?
I lost the power. Do you understand?
我想我們最好重新來
Think we better start over.
- 你覺得呢?  - 什麼?
- Don't you?  - What?
啊!
Aah!
沒人知道二等兵凱奇去了哪兒!
No one knows what happened to Private Cage!
你個白癡 他剛才就在你旁邊
You dumb-ass. He was right next to you.
你不知道那個狡猾的混蛋跑哪裏去了?
You don't know where that slippery son of a bitch went?
不知道 軍士!
No, sarge!
好吧
All right.
我們再來50下 來嗎?
Let's do another 50, shall we?
一!
And one!
不 等等! 等等 我叫比爾·凱奇
No, wait! Wait. My name is Bill Cage.
我... 我們在沙灘上見過 我們會在沙灘上見 明天
I... We met on the beach. We meet on the beach. Tomorrow.
我有你要的
I have what you had.
呃 好吧 我們再次出發吧
Ugh. All right, let's go again.
你沒時間思考 記住
You don't have time to think. Remember.
知道他們要去哪裏是不夠的
It's not enough knowing where they're going to be.
你得知道如何殺了它們
You have to know how to kill them.
堅持住 堅持住 聽著 聽...
Hold on. Hold on. Listen. List...
好吧 做吧
Okay. Do it.
呃!
Unh!
站起來 窩囊廢!
On your feet, maggot!
停下! 等等! 等等 等等 等等!
Stop! Wait! Wait, wait, wait!
停下! 等等! 等一會!
Stop! Wait! Wait a second!
等一下 等一下
Wait a sec. Wait a second.
那個 我在想
You know, I've been thinking.
我是說 這玩意兒在我的血液裏
I mean, this thing's in my blood.
可能有一些方法... 我能轉移給你
So maybe there's some way... I can transfer it to you.
我試過所有方法了 都沒成功
I've tried everything. It doesn't work.
我是說 你有沒有...
I mean, have you...
你懂的...
you know...
試過所有其他的可能性?
tried all the other options?
哦 你是說做愛 嗯 試過
Oh, you mean sex. Yep. Tried it.
多少次?
How many times?
好吧
All right.
左邊
Left.
左邊! 左邊 左邊!
Left! Left, left!
把眼睛睜大點
Keep your eyes open.
再來
Again.
再來
Again.
再來
Again.
再來
Again.
等一下! 等等
Just wait! Wait.
我想我沒事
I think I'm okay.
啊!
Unh!
站起來!
On your feet!
窩囊廢! 窩囊廢!
Maggot! Maggot!
我在試著對你溫柔點 窩囊廢! 動起來!
I'm trying to be nice to you, maggot! Move!
你沒事吧 凱奇?
You okay, Cage?
哦 沒事 沒事 我沒事! 我很好!
Oh yeah, yeah! I'm good! I'm good!
你的腿斷了
Your leg's broken.
沒 我還能感覺到我的腳趾
No. I can still feel my toes.
哦 別逞強了
Oh, come on.
啊!
Aah!
芮塔 芮塔 這是什麼情況? 你在這裏做什麼?
Rita. Rita. What is this? What are you doing here?
- 這傢伙是誰?  - 他是我...
- Who's this guy?  - He's me...
- 在凡爾登之前的我  - 在凡爾登之前
- before Verdun.  - Before Verdun.
你是什麼意思? 他是...?
What do you mean? He's...?
- 沒錯 沒錯  - 他什麼時候死的?
- Yes. Yes.  - When did he die?
- 在哪裏?  - 在沙灘上 明天
- Where?  - On the beach. Tomorrow.
我叫比爾·凱奇 你是卡特博士
I'm Bill Cage. You're Dr. Carter.
我們之前有過這個對話了 你背後抵著兩個手指
We've had this conversation before. Two fingers behind your back.
我能看到景象了
I've had the visions.
我看到了歐米加
I've seen the Omega.
嗯...
Um...
明天差不多就是完蛋的節奏
It's pretty much game over tomorrow.
那麼我們能繼續嗎?
So can we move this along?
好 哪裏?
Okay. Where?
有一座大壩
There's a dam.
在山裏面 我看到了有德語寫在上面
It's in the mountains. I saw German writing.
你覺得你能找到它在哪裏嗎?
Do you think you can work out where that is?
我是說 沒有... 那麼多地方符合那樣的描述
I mean, there can't be... too many places that fit that description.
我會盡力
I'll see what I can do.
訓練結束 明天見
Training's over. I'll see you tomorrow.
我們都不知道我們要去哪裏
We don't even know where we're going.
我們馬上就知道了
We will soon enough.
同時 你需要找到一個方法讓我們遠離那個沙灘
In the meantime, you need to figure out a way to get us off that beach.
下一步呢? 我們要去哪裏?
What next? Where are we going?
哪條路? 集中精神 哪條路?
Which way? Focus. Which way?
- 我在想  - 好
- I'm thinking.  - Okay.
哦 天啊!
Oh, man!
我們剛才走了多遠?
How far did we make it?
很難說 真的
You know, it's hard to say, really.
停下! 停下!
Hold! Hold!
好了 走吧!
Okay, go!
混蛋!
Son of a bitch!
我剛才想的就是向左 然後躲避... 就是說一下
I thought stepping left, ducking... Just for the record.
- 真詳細  - 向左走 然後躲在右邊
- It was pretty specific.  - Stepping left, ducking right.
向左走 躲在右邊 繼續
Stepping left, ducking right. Move on.
堅持住!
Hold on!
跨過壕溝 12點方向!
Across the trench, 12:00!
然後向右看!
Then look to your right!
你沒有說仔細
You're not being specific.
你需要說仔細 否則 我就會死
You need to be specific. Otherwise, I'm dead.
芮塔
Rita.
凱奇!
Cage!
爬上壕溝頂部 我要向左跨了
Paces up to the top of the trench. I'm gonna step left.
那裏有一個模仿者 我會殺了它
A mimic there, which I'll kill.
船體爆炸 我會向西北跑30步
Ship explosion. I'm gonna run 30 paces northwest.
我會在那個壕溝頂部躲好 然後我會向左轉
I'm gonna duck at the top of that trench and then I'm gonna turn left.
我臉上有什麼東西嗎?
Have I got something on my face?
沒有
No.
凱奇!
Cage!

你在說什麼?
What are you talking about?

Okay, Skinner. Watch this.
現在我閉上眼睛

要是他們上 這場戰爭早就結束了
In their day, this war would have been over by now.
他們到底要什麼?
What do they want with us, anyway?
很明顯不是嗎? 礦產
It's obvious, isn't it? Minerals.
- 礦產?  - 是啊 金屬礦產 
- Minerals?  - Yeah, minerals. Metals.
- 他們要氧氣?  - 氧氣?
- Oxygen, they want. - Oxygen?
- 想想吧  - 這有什麼區別?

- 肯定是這兒 跟描述完全一致  - 你找到了
- This has got to be it. It fits the description.  - You found it.
又找到了
Again.
那又能怎麼樣?
What difference does it make?
我們根本到不了那
Because we're never gonna get there.
不管我們怎麼做...
No matter what we do...
不管我們怎麼精心策劃...
no matter how carefully we plan...
都過不了海灘
we can't get off that beach.
你可以做到的 你可以
You can do this. You can.
你每天都到這來 我來訓練你
You keep coming here every day and I'll train you.
已經訓練過了
You already have.
- 我在等! 南希!  - 五百米外有敵人在往這邊來!
- I'm waiting, Nance!  - Five hundred meters and closing fast!
怎麼回事...?
What the...?
重新裝彈
Reload.
下一步呢?
What's next?
往山的方向直直打
Straight shot up the hill.
好的
Okay.
軍士長 新來的那個...
Hey, sarge, the new guy...
他叫什麼?
what's his name again?
我們需要有車才能走更遠
We'll need a vehicle to get further inland.
有什麼麻煩嗎?
What's the problem?
那裏肯定有伏擊 還沒找到車就會被殺掉
The ambush waiting for us. They kill us before we find a working car.
好 那現在怎麼辦
Okay. So, what's the current plan?
還有兩輛車沒試過
Two cars we haven't tried yet.
- 小貨車和綠色SUV  - 好的
- The minivan and the green SUV.  - Yeah. Okay.
我去SUV 把模仿者引過去 你去小貨車那
I'll head for the SUV, draw the mimics to me. You go for the minivan.
發動之後就直接開走 不用等我
You get it started, just go, take off. Do not wait for me.
好
Okay.
對了 發動前別忘了把拖車鬆開
Just don't forget to disconnect the caravan before you take off.
你要趕快 不能帶累贅
You are going to be in a hurry, you don't want any dead weight.
拜託
Come on.
快! 凱奇!
Come on, Cage!
形勢嚴峻 敵人已經破壞了多佛的防禦
casualties. The enemy has breached security at Dover.
我看不見
Can't see.
你能嗎?
Can you?
市民不要外出 保持鎮定
Stay where you are and remain calm.
如果你在車裏 請鎖上車不要出來
If you are in a vehicle please lock doors and stay inside.
我很抱歉 敵人已經到了倫敦
I'm sorry. The enemy has reached London.
重複
Repeat.
倫敦在被襲擊
London is under attack.
開得不錯
Good driving.
我忘了解開拖車
I forgot to unhook the trailer.
你不太愛說話
You don't talk much.
我不喜歡
I'm not a fan.
說話嗎?
Of talking?
是的 不喜歡說話
Not a fan of talking. No.
你最終和我說話了
You know you eventually do talk to me.
話題總圍繞著里昂
It's usually around Lyons.
你說你和你的家人一起去過
You tell me about the time you went there with your family.
你弟弟失蹤了
Your brother got lost.
我從沒去過里昂
I've never been to Lyons.
你告訴我過你的中間名
You tell me your middle name.
裴唐
Peyton.
這不是我中間名
That's not my middle name.
你是在商場找到你弟弟的
You find your brother in the arcade, by the way.
那應該都是我瞎說為了讓你安靜點
Well, maybe I made it all up just to keep you quiet.
反正我們說過話
But you do talk to me.
凱奇 我沒有必要去瞭解你
Cage, I do not need to get to know you.
如果你是聰明人 就別瞭解我
If you knew what was good for you, you wouldn't want to get to know me.
多想想怎麼保命吧
It's the only way you make it through this thing.
那你認識亨裏奇嗎? 你認識他?
What about Hendricks? You get to know him?
- 你怎麼知道這個名字?  - 你提到過
- How do you know that name?  - You mentioned him.
不可能
That's not possible.
不然我怎麼知道?
Then how do I know his name?
我什麼時候說的? 在什麼情況下?
When did I mention him? Under what circumstance?
因為他你才不跟我說話嗎?
Is he why you won't talk to me?
別再提他的名字
Don't ever mention his name again.
- 為什麼? 你愛上他了?  - 他死了
- Why? Are you... in love with him?  - He's dead.
我親眼看他死過三百次 而且記得所有細節 
And I watched him die 300 times and I remember every detail.
記得任何事 所以我不想再談這些
I remember everything. So I don't need to talk about it.
很抱歉
I'm sorry.
這就是戰爭
It's just war.
這什麼都沒有 我們走吧
There's nothing here. Let's keep going.
得先找到鑰匙
We have to find the keys.
弄點兒汽油就行了
Let's just siphon the gas.
- 有飛機為什麼還要開車?  - 這個嗎?
- Why drive when we can fly?  - In that thing?
- 我猜猜 你肯定恐高  - 我怕墜機
- Let me guess. You're afraid of heights.  - I'm afraid of crashing.
這又沒什麼可丟人的
And not at all ashamed to admit it.
沒事的 凱奇 能克服
You'll be fine, Cage. You'll learn. Oh.
怎麼了?
What is it?
沒什麼 我沒事
It's nothing. I'm fine.
- 怎麼了?  - 沒什麼
- What is it?  - It's nothing.
芮塔
Rita.
我看看
Let me see.
得找到直升機的鑰匙
We have to find the keys to the helicopter.
肯定在附近什麼地方
I'm sure they're around here somewhere.
直升機的油是滿的 我找到一根軟管
You know, the heli's full of fuel, though. I found a hose.
我們飛 凱奇
We're flying, Cage.
你知道就算我們找到了鑰匙
Let's just say we find the keys. You know?
開走了那架直升機
Get that helicopter started.
我們既沒有戰甲 也沒有彈藥
We don't have our jackets or ammunition.
馬上就要天黑了
It's gonna be dark in a few hours.
還不如回到剛才那個農舍
Might be better off just going back to the farmhouse.
找點什麼可以用上的
Seeing what we could salvage.
在那裏過一夜 早上再回這兒
Spend the night there. Come back here in the morning.
蜷縮在篝火旁邊 再開上一瓶好酒
And curl up by the fire and open a bottle of wine.
我覺得我們還是應該重來
I think we should just reset.
哇!
Whoa!
這是死路一條 如果你認為都一樣的話 我累了 我很痛苦
It's a dead end. If it's all the same to you I'm tired. I'm in pain.
- 我寧可重新再來一次  - 告訴你
- I'd rather just start fresh.  - Tell you what.
先休息一下 咖啡煮好了
Take a few minutes. Coffee's ready.
我去找找鑰匙 應該能找到
I'll look for the keys. That's productive.
- 十分鐘  - 好的
- Ten minutes.  - Okay.
然後我殺掉你
Then I'm killing you.
好
Fine.
你居然能找到咖啡
I can't believe you found coffee.
謝謝
Thank you.
哦
Oh.
加糖嗎?
Sugar, right?
好的
Yeah.
- 謝謝  - 等等 三勺
- Thank you.  - No, hold on. Three. You like three.
那兒有件襯衣 你應該能穿下
There's a shirt over there. It should be your size.
我們來這裏幾次了?
How many times have we been here?
來過幾次?
How many times?
鑰匙在哪?
Where are the keys?
- 鑰匙到底在哪?  - 好
- Where are the goddamn keys?  - Okay.
你會開的 對吧?
You can fly it, can't you?
不會 好吧 會
No. Well, yes.
我只會起飛 降落還沒學會
I mean, I can take off. I'm still working on my landing.
那還在這裏幹什麼?
What are we still doing here?
- 簡直在浪費時間!  - 芮塔 發動引擎你就會死
- You're wasting time!  - Rita, if you start that engine, you die.
你最多只能活到這
This is as far as you go.
無論我做什麼...
No matter what I do...
你都會死在這裏
this is as far as you ever make it.
二十碼以外藏著一個Mimics
There's a mimic buried 20 yards away.
你發動引擎它就會攻擊你
It attacks when you start the engine.
拿上你的武器上直升機 凱奇
Get your weapon and get in the helicopter, Cage.
回到那邊會遇到更多
There's more in the field back there.
我們倆只有一個能活下去
Only one of us ever makes it.
上來
Get in.
唯一沒有試過的方案就是你回去 回到農舍去
Only thing we haven't tried is you walk away. Go to the farmhouse.
有藏身處有吃的 
There's a cellar and there's food.
你在這兒等著我回來 你會安全的
Wait there... till I get back. You'll be safe.
我是士兵 我是自願的 我不走
I'm a soldier. I volunteered. I'm not walking away.
你會死的 就在這
You die here. Right here.
我救不了你
I can't save you.
而之後我若去殺了歐米加 你死了
And if I go on and kill the Omega, you're dead.
就無法復活了
Forever.
我怎麼樣有那麼重要嗎?
Why does it matter what happens to me?
我希望...
I wish...
沒見過你
I didn't know you.
但是我見了
But I do.
我的中間名...
My middle name...
是蘿絲
is Rose.
站起來 窩囊廢!
On your feet, maggot!
好消息是你還有希望 二等兵
The good news is there's hope for you, private.
希望就在光榮的戰役中
Hope in the form of glorious combat.
戰爭是偉大的救世主
Battle is the great redeemer.
一個能鍛造真正英雄的熾熱熔爐
The fiery crucible in which the only true heroes are forged.
什麼事?
Yes?
誰讓你跟我說話了?
Who said you could talk to me?
我臉上有東西嗎士兵?
Have I got something on my face, soldier?
很抱歉打擾你了 中士
I'm sorry to disturb you, sergeant.
我們開始吧 我幫你裝備
Let's get this show on the road. I gotta suit up.
你的頭盔呢?
Where's your helmet?
不穿 礙手礙腳
Never wear one. It's a distraction.
你喝醉了吧?
Have you been drinking?
再給我三個五五六的彈簧夾...
I need three more clips of 5.56...
八顆手雷 還有一塊電池
eight grenades and an extra battery.
快點
Get it.
喂!
Oi!
夥計!
Oi, mate!
你的衣服好像不太對勁
There's something wrong with your suit.
裏面有個死人
There's a dead guy in it.
哇哦!
Whoo-hoo!
我們成功了!
We made it!
謝天謝地 我們成功了!
Thank God, we made it!
搞定了!
Finish it!
- 它不在那  - 什麼意思?
- It isn't there.  - What do you mean?
我猜它從來就沒在那兒
My guess is it never was.
它們知道我們要來 它們伏擊我們
They knew we were coming. They ambushed us.
幻象就是個陷阱
The visions were a trap.
就像芮塔在凡爾登看到的幻象一樣
Just like Rita's visions were a trap at Verdun.
它可以殺我但沒殺 它想要我的血
It could have killed me, but it didn't. It was after my blood.
那它們知道有你的存在了
So they know who you are. They...
它們想收復權力
They want their power back.
就算這次沒成 遲早都會 除非我們能找到歐米加
They're gonna get it one way or another. Unless we find the Omega.
- 沒別的辦法了 我們完了  - 不
- There isn't any other way. We're finished.  - No.
我們沒完
We're not finished.
我無法讓它工作
I can't get it to work.
你在白宮做過一個原型
You built a prototype at Whitehall.
沒錯 托你的福 我為此丟了工作
Yes, and I got fired for it, thank you very much.
- 這到底是什麼東西?  - 這是個轉發器
- What is this thing?  - It's a transponder.
把它放到阿爾法體內 它會送信號波給歐米加
Stick it into the Alpha and it taps into the wavelength connecting it to the Omega.
這只是個想法
That's the idea, anyway.
但我沒法讓它工作 現有的設備根本不行
I can't get it to work. Not with the equipment I have.
哪兒有你需要的設備?
How do we get what you need?
問題就在這 白宮裏 我造了一個
That's the thing. When I was at Whitehall, I built one.
差不多都可以進行測試了
I was even ready to test it.
我跟主管匯報以後 就把工作丟了
When I told my superiors about it, I lost my job.
都覺得他瘋了
They thought he was crazy.
所以我們需要去趟白宮
So we need to go to Whitehall.
接近大門 你就會被捕的
She'd be arrested 10 feet from the front door.
精神病院 解剖研究 記得嗎? 嘿 嘿 嘿!
Psych ward, dissection, remember? Hey, hey, hey.
你們忘了一件事?
Aren't you forgetting something?
轉發器要在活的阿爾法身上才管用
The transponder requires a live Alpha to make it work.
我們不需要 眼前這個就夠了
We don't need one. We got the next best thing.
等中國代表團出來時要加快腳步
When the Chinese delegation comes out we pick up the pace.
那個戴黃袖章的傢伙每次都能認出你...
This guy with the yellow armband always recognizes you...
所以你要低著頭 在我右邊走
so just keep your head down and stay to my right.
幹得不錯
Nicely done.
三 二 一 走
Three, two, one. Go.
一...
One...
六 七...
Six, seven...
八...
eight...
十二...
Twelve...
十五 走
Fifteen. Now.
轉身
And, turn.
好的 繼續走 眼睛往前看
Okay. Keep walking. Just stare straight ahead.
羅賓森
Robinson.
我說過了別打擾我 你最好有個好理由
I've asked not to be disturbed. This had better be critical.
人類的命運
The fate of mankind.
這個理由夠嗎?
Critical enough?
竟然是你
I don't believe what I'm seeing.
我跟你想的一樣
I've had more than my share of that.
坐下 將軍 離那桌子遠一點
Sit down, general. Stay away from the desk.
我要是你 就不會當兒戲
I'd take her very seriously if I were you.
真是讓人佩服 少校
Have to hand it to you, major.
你離開這間辦公室的時候 從沒想到你會回來...
When you left this office today, I never imagined you'd be back...
更別說是帶著我最優秀的士兵
let alone with my most decorated soldier.
我給你講個故事吧 聽著會覺得很荒唐 
I'm gonna tell you a story. It's gonna sound ridiculous.
但你越往下聽 會越覺得合理
The longer I talk, the more rational it's going to appear.
告訴他一會打回去
Tell him you'll call back.
告訴誰?
Tell who?
是貝蒙少校 從哈爾法克斯打來的 他的飛機沒能按時起飛 壞天氣
Major General Beaumont, calling from Halifax. His plane's just been delayed. Bad weather.
你好
Yes.
謝謝 貝蒙 一會兒打給你
Thank you, Beaumont. I'll call you back.
明天的戰鬥是場屠殺
Tomorrow's invasion is a slaughter.
我到海灘上五分鐘就會死 那些被你送上去的士兵也一樣
I'm dead within minutes of landing along with every other soldier you are sending.
因為敵人早就知道我們的計劃
And that's because the enemy knows we're coming.
我怎麼知道的? 我死前...
How do I know this? Before I died...
殺了一個模仿者 只是它有點特別
I killed a mimic, only this one was different.
它傳了一些東西到我的血液裏
It passed something on to me. In my blood.
現在我像他們一樣 一次又一次地重複過著今天
Now I live the same day over and over again. Just like they do.
就像當時在凡爾登的維塔斯基中士一樣
Just like Sergeant Vrataski at Verdun.
跟你的秘書說沒關係
Tell your secretary everything's fine.
什麼?
Beg your pardon?
抱歉 將軍 我以為你沒有客人的
Sorry, general. I thought you were alone.
沒關係
It's fine.
她把要你簽字的指令打印了出來
She typed up those orders for you to authorize.
但她漏掉了那些關於格林威治燃料庫的文件
But she left out the ones referring to the fuel dump at Greenwich.
你是艾瑞斯
Your name is Iris.
你的生日是九月十七日
Your birthday is September 17th.
將軍幫你走了個後門...
The general pulled some strings...
把你兒子安排到了澳大利亞 盡量遠離戰爭
stationed your son in Australia, as far from the war as possible.
告訴將軍晚餐活動取消了 剛剛得到電話通知
Tell the general his dinner's been canceled. The call came in just now.
你的晚餐取消了
Your dinner was canceled.
你漏了燃料庫
You forgot the fuel dump.
謝謝 艾瑞斯
Thank you, Iris.
就這些吧
That'll be all.
- 凱奇 該走了 快  - 芮塔
- Cage, let's go. Come on.  - Rita.
- 讓我... 別再開槍打他了  - 我們要幹嘛?
- Let me... Don't shoot him again.  - What are we doing?
好嗎? 就讓我...
Okay? Just...
將軍 這不是我們第一次進行這個談話
General, this isn't the first time we've had this conversation.
因為你很固執
That's because you're stubborn.
你不肯相信我說的話 我說卡特博士是正確的
You won't believe me when I tell you that Dr. Carter was right.
我們的敵人可以控制時間
That the enemy can manipulate time.
這次襲擊會失敗 不管你讓多少人去送死
The invasion will fail. No matter how many bodies you throw at it.
贏這場戰爭的唯一方式是...
The only way to win this war is...
找到敵人的能量源頭並摧毀它
by finding this power source of the mimic horde and killing it.
而唯一能找到它的東西就在這個保險箱裏
And the only means of finding it is in that safe right there.
不管我跟你說多少次...
No matter how many times we have this conversation...
你都拒絕接受敵人明天會攻佔倫敦的事實
you refuse to accept that the enemy breaks through to London tomorrow...
我們會輸的 輸掉一切
and we lose. We lose everything.
我現在...
Let's say for one moment...
也不知道...
that I can't rationally explain...
你對我使了什麼伎倆
your impressive parlor tricks.
卡特博士告訴我...
Dr. Carter told me...
這個儀器需要一個活的模仿者才能運作 你拿著它能幹什麼?
this device requires a live mimic to work. What use is it to you?
- 這是我關心的問題了  - 恰恰相反
- That's my concern.  - On the contrary.
按你說的 這個是全世界關心的問題
According to you, this concerns the whole world.
如果你相信我剛剛所說的一切 你會做什麼?
Well, what would you do if you believed everything I just told you?
- 我會找到這個...  - 歐米加
- I would locate this...  - Omega.
把它炸得片甲不留
Bomb it out of existence.
但你不具備打敗這東西的腦力條件 你以後也不會具備
You're not mentally equipped to fight this thing. And you never will be.
我們現在做什麼?
What do we do now?
我不知道 我們從沒走到過這一步
I don't know. We've never gotten this far.
很容易嘛
That was easy.
趴下!
Down!
停在那裏! 不許動!
Stop right there! Don't move!
別動!
Nobody move!
有武器!
Weapon!
停下!
Stop!
- 他們跑了!  - 他們...
- They're off and away!  - They're...
- 我要怎麼用這個玩意?  - 扎進你的大腿 快點!
- What am I supposed to do with this? - Stick it in your leg. Do it!
凱奇 怎麼樣了?
Cage, what's happening?
告訴我
Talk to me.
我感覺到它了 它在帶我去那
I feel it. It's taking me there.
你看見什麼了?
What do you see?
盧浮宮
It's the Louvre.
哪裏? 你在哪裏?
Where? Where are you?
我現在在裏面 被水淹了
I'm inside now. It's flooded.
在往下走 在一個車庫裏 博物館地下車庫
Now I'm going down. I'm in a garage. A garage underneath the museum.
你能看見歐米加嗎?
The Omega. Can you see it?
它在巴黎
It's in Paris.
芮塔!
Rita!
呆在車裏!
Stay in the car!
- 別靠近  - 別過來 別過來
- Stay back.  - Move away. Move away.
你幹什麼了?
What have you done?
你幹了什麼?
What have you done?
你會沒事的 你只是需要輸血
You'll be fine. You just needed blood.
你根本不知道你剛剛做了什麼
You don't know what you've just done.
- 我不該跟你講話  - 跟我在一起的另一個人
- I can't talk to you.  - I was with someone.
芮塔·維塔斯基 她還活著嗎?
Rita Vrataski. Is she alive?
芮塔·維塔斯基
Rita Vrataski.
求你了
Please.
告訴我吧
Just tell me that.
求你告訴我
Please tell me.
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.
我三分鐘就從這東西裏出來了 你怎麼搞的?
I was out of those things in three minutes flat. What's wrong with you?
我以為你死了
I thought you were dead.
還沒呢
Not yet.
- 抱歉 凱奇  - 不! 等等!
- Sorry, Cage.  - No! Whoa. Wait! Wait!
我不行了 他們給我輸血了
I'm out. I'm out. They gave me blood.
我失去能力了
I lost the power.
我能感覺到
I feel it.
我再也不能把今天重置了
I can't reset the day anymore.
我們要在進攻開始之前殺死歐米加
We have to kill the Omega before the invasion starts.
我們只剩不到三個小時
That gives us less than three hours.
我們需要一架空投機才能及時感到巴黎
We need a drop ship to get to Paris in time.
也需要更多的士兵
Need more soldiers too.
誰能瘋狂到跟我們一起去巴黎呢?
Now, who's crazy enough to follow us to Paris?
凱奇!
Cage!
凱奇!
Cage!
- 夥計們!  - 我們到處找你 
- Guys!  - We've been looking everywhere for you.
- 聽著  - 法瑞差點因為我們找不到你...
- Just listen.  - Farell almost strung us up...
- 吃了我們  - 我知道 聽著
- for losing track of you.  - I know. Just listen.
你會想聽聽這故事的
You're gonna wanna hear this story.
開始會覺得很荒唐
It's gonna sound ridiculous at first.
但到後面你會覺得越來越合理
The longer I talk, the more rational it's going to appear.
是嗎?
Yeah?
他說出了我學校的名字
He named the school I went to.
他還說出了我二年級的老師波裏歐小姐
And then he tells me my second grade teacher was called Miss Polio.
說她不讓他去廁所 讓他尿了褲子
She wouldn't let him go to the bathroom made him wet his pants.
閉嘴
Shut up.
我跟你說 夥計
Look, I am telling you, man.
他知道關於我們的
He knows everything.
所有事情
About all of us.
- 胡扯  - 是嗎?
- Bullshit.  - Yeah?
他說你的真名不是弗特
He says your name ain't really Ford.
說弗特是你的朋友
Says Ford was your friend.
上戰場第一天就死了
Died in combat on his first day.
你頂替了他 把你的支票寄給了他家裏人
You took his place. Send your checks to his family.
你個混賬
You slippery bitch.
凱奇說敵人也瞭解我們 他們在沙灘上等我們
Cage says the enemy knows us too. They're waiting for us on the beach.
我們都會死的
And we all die.
這次進攻就是一次屠殺
The whole invasion is a slaughter.
太棒了
Well, this is great.
真鼓舞士氣 謝了
Really good confidence boost for tomorrow. Thanks.
但我們可以改變這個 對嗎?
But we can change it, right?
我們一定能做些什麼
There has to be something that we can do.
一定有一個我們能贏的方法
There has to be a way that we can win.
我們還有機會 雖然很渺茫
There is a chance. It's a slim one.
