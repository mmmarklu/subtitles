00:00:31,996 --> 00:00:35,762
Harold arnd Kumar

2
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:37,892
Harold arnd Kume

3
00:00:39,036 --> 00:00:41,527
Billy Boy!
Get your ass ready.

4
00:00:41,605 --> 00:00:44,472
lt's almost 5:00, and this bad boy
needs to get his drink on.

5
00:00:44,542 --> 00:00:46,635
- No, no, no. Give me that.
- Don't.

6
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,940
- l'm gonna burn it once and for all.
- Stop that.

7
00:00:49,013 --> 00:00:51,641
Dude, it's been six months.
lt's time to move on, okay?

8
00:00:51,715 --> 00:00:53,876
Whatever. Even if
l wanted to meet other women,

9
00:00:53,951 --> 00:00:55,248
l wouldn't even know what to do.

10
00:00:55,319 --> 00:00:57,219
l've been out of the game
for so long.

11
00:00:57,288 --> 00:01:00,280
Dude, you come out with me tonight,
l promise you will get laid.

12
00:01:00,357 --> 00:01:02,416
Yeah, it sounds very tempting,

13
00:01:02,493 --> 00:01:04,290
but Berenson needs me to update
these financial models

14
00:01:04,361 --> 00:01:06,022
for the meeting
with the foreign investors.

15
00:01:06,096 --> 00:01:07,563
So what?
lt's Friday night.

16
00:01:07,631 --> 00:01:09,360
The Germans are taking
an early flight back.

17
00:01:09,433 --> 00:01:11,025
The meeting got changed
to tomorrow.

18
00:01:11,101 --> 00:01:12,932
So? Why don't you
just get somebody else

19
00:01:13,003 --> 00:01:14,561
to do your work for you?

20
00:01:14,638 --> 00:01:15,866
Who?

21
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:19,967
Harold, l need you to update
those models for me.

22
00:01:20,044 --> 00:01:22,672
- Billy, aren't you supposed to--
- l know. Something just came up.

23
00:01:22,746 --> 00:01:24,839
l have this meeting
with these new clients tonight,

24
00:01:24,915 --> 00:01:27,713
and l'm never gonna have time
to get to those.

25
00:01:27,785 --> 00:01:30,345
So that's your
responsibility now, big boy.

26
00:01:30,421 --> 00:01:33,185
Make sure those are in
by 9:00 sharp tomorrow.

27
00:01:33,257 --> 00:01:35,555
With all the downsizing
that's been going on around here,

28
00:01:35,626 --> 00:01:38,754
we wouldn't want to have to tell Berenson
you've been slacking, now would we?

29
00:01:45,636 --> 00:01:47,160
Yeah.

30
00:01:47,238 --> 00:01:49,138
Okay, no problem.

31
00:01:49,206 --> 00:01:50,571
Hey.

32
00:01:50,641 --> 00:01:52,973
You have a great weekend,
okay, buddy?

33
00:01:53,043 --> 00:01:55,671
l owe you one.
Just one.

34
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,169
Thank you.

35
00:02:05,556 --> 00:02:09,083
Wow! That was amazing.
l cannot believe how easy that was.

36
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:11,320
Dude, how do you think
l get all my shit done?

37
00:02:11,395 --> 00:02:13,556
l'm telling you, those Asian guys
love crunching numbers.

38
00:02:13,631 --> 00:02:15,622
You probably
just made his weekend.

39
00:02:17,534 --> 00:02:18,933
Clhick magrnet

40
00:02:19,003 --> 00:02:21,665
Clhick magrnet. clhick magrnet

41
00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:24,071
Clhick magrnet. yealh

42
00:02:24,141 --> 00:02:25,438
Fuck.

43
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,039
An excellent point, Mr. Patel.

44
00:02:28,112 --> 00:02:30,637
You are one of the finest applicants
l have ever interviewed.

45
00:02:30,714 --> 00:02:31,908
Thank you.

46
00:02:31,982 --> 00:02:36,009
lt comes as no surprise. Your father
is highly respected in his field.

47
00:02:36,086 --> 00:02:37,747
As you probably heard
from your old man,

48
00:02:37,821 --> 00:02:40,949
he and l had some pretty wild times
back in med school.

49
00:02:41,025 --> 00:02:42,185
Really?

50
00:02:42,259 --> 00:02:45,285
Yeah. We started
our own basketball team--

51
00:02:45,362 --> 00:02:47,296
the Hemoglobin Trotters.

52
00:02:47,831 --> 00:02:50,391
Hemo-globin Trotters--
get it?

53
00:02:50,467 --> 00:02:55,837
A play on the name of the famous
colored, Negro basketball squad--

54
00:02:55,906 --> 00:02:58,136
black, African-American.

55
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:00,938
You know, people of colors.

56
00:03:01,011 --> 00:03:04,606
Let's end up with one final question,
just as a formality.

57
00:03:04,682 --> 00:03:08,618
What are some potential
symptoms of pancreatitis?

58
00:03:08,686 --> 00:03:11,678
Well, you would have
epigastric tenderness,

59
00:03:11,755 --> 00:03:13,586
diffuse abdominal tenderness...

60
00:03:14,358 --> 00:03:16,622
l'm sorry.
Can you hold on one second?

61
00:03:18,562 --> 00:03:20,154
Kumar's phone.
Kumar speaking.

62
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:21,993
Hey, what's up? lt's me.
What are you doing?

63
00:03:22,066 --> 00:03:24,159
Nothing important. l can talk.
What's going on?

64
00:03:24,234 --> 00:03:28,500
Listen, l can't party tonight, okay?
l gotta stay late at the office.

65
00:03:28,572 --> 00:03:30,506
Dude, fuck that shit.
We had plans.

66
00:03:30,574 --> 00:03:32,599
l know, but l got
a lot of work to do.

67
00:03:32,676 --> 00:03:36,077
When has getting high ever
prevented you from doing your work?

68
00:03:36,146 --> 00:03:37,135
Jesus!

69
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:40,813
Believe me.
l would love to come lhome. okay?

70
00:03:40,884 --> 00:03:42,647
- l got a lot of work to do.
- Thank you. l'll do that.

71
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,813
l got a quarter of the
finest herb in New York City.

72
00:03:44,888 --> 00:03:46,583
l'm not smoking
that shit alone, okay?

73
00:03:46,657 --> 00:03:49,387
So you need to just chill the fuck out
and prepare to get blazed

74
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,052
because in the next couple of hours,

75
00:03:51,128 --> 00:03:53,255
l expect both of us to be
blitzed out of our skulls, got it?

76
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:54,524
All right, l got it.

77
00:03:54,598 --> 00:03:57,032
l'll talk to you later.
Where was l?

78
00:03:57,101 --> 00:04:00,468
We've got the severe anal discharge,
sometimes violent--a.k.a. diarrhea.

79
00:04:00,537 --> 00:04:03,370
Mr. Patel, l am more than familiar
with diarrhea.

80
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,307
Do you actually believe
after the way you've just behaved

81
00:04:06,377 --> 00:04:09,107
that l would ever even consider
recommending you for admission?

82
00:04:09,179 --> 00:04:11,044
No. l'm gonna
be honest with you.

83
00:04:11,115 --> 00:04:12,104
The only reason l'm applying

84
00:04:12,182 --> 00:04:13,479
is so my dad
will keep paying for my apartment.

85
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,211
l really don't have a desire
to go to med school.

86
00:04:15,285 --> 00:04:17,845
But you have perfect MCAT scores.

87
00:04:17,921 --> 00:04:19,889
Yeah. Just 'cause you're
hung like a moose

88
00:04:19,957 --> 00:04:21,652
doesn't mean you gotta do porn.

89
00:04:22,192 --> 00:04:24,217
Get out! Bernadette,
show this young man to the door!

90
00:04:24,294 --> 00:04:27,855
And please bring in
some fresh diarrhe--dry towels!

91
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,762
Yes!

92
00:05:04,835 --> 00:05:07,065
Right in front of the door.

93
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,274
This is America, dude!
Learn how to drive!

94
00:05:12,342 --> 00:05:13,707
Better ''ruck'' tomorrow!

95
00:05:15,946 --> 00:05:18,779
- Extreme!
- Fucking assholes.

96
00:05:20,284 --> 00:05:21,512
Fuck.

97
00:06:00,524 --> 00:06:01,957
Okay.

98
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,552
Be yourself.
Don't be nervous.

99
00:06:25,249 --> 00:06:27,911
So, Maria, what's been goin' on?

100
00:06:27,985 --> 00:06:31,944
l actually had a very long week
at work. How about you?

101
00:06:32,022 --> 00:06:34,354
Work was good.
l caught up on some sleep.

102
00:06:34,424 --> 00:06:37,052
Plus, the guy who works next to me
decided to bathe for a change.

103
00:06:37,127 --> 00:06:38,424
Really?

104
00:06:38,495 --> 00:06:40,360
So what are you up to tonight?

105
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:42,694
Actually, l'm just gonna
be sitting on my ass,

106
00:06:42,766 --> 00:06:44,427
probably eat a whole pint
of H?agen-Dazs

107
00:06:44,501 --> 00:06:45,695
while l watch Blirnd Date.

108
00:06:45,769 --> 00:06:48,397
Well, that sounds awful.

109
00:06:50,474 --> 00:06:51,941
lf you want some company,

110
00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:54,842
maybe you can come over
and sit on your ass at my place.

111
00:06:56,046 --> 00:06:57,513
That sounds nice.

112
00:07:44,227 --> 00:07:45,592
Bye.

113
00:07:47,531 --> 00:07:49,556
Bye. Bye.

114
00:08:05,215 --> 00:08:06,409
Kumar.

115
00:08:06,483 --> 00:08:07,780
Yo.

116
00:08:14,091 --> 00:08:15,581

120
00:08:30,507 --> 00:08:32,805
Why aren't you
doing this in your room, man?

121
00:08:32,876 --> 00:08:35,367
The mirror's in here.
Hey, check it out. lt's like a bonsai tree.

122
00:08:35,445 --> 00:08:36,434
Hey!

123
00:08:36,513 --> 00:08:38,811
Besides, man, it makes
your johnson look totally bigger.

124
00:08:38,882 --> 00:08:40,611

125
00:08:41,518 --> 00:08:45,181
Are those my scissors?
Dude, l trim my nose hair with those!

126
00:08:45,255 --> 00:08:48,349
Dude, l've been cutting my ass hair

127
00:08:51,695 --> 00:08:54,289
Get out!
Get out of my room.

128
00:09:03,507 --> 00:09:05,202

00:09:34,471 --> 00:09:38,373
Oh, nice.
Sixteern Carndles is on, man.

137
00:09:38,442 --> 00:09:40,842
And the award for the least
heterosexual statement

138
00:09:40,911 --> 00:09:44,312

goes to...Harold Lee.

139
00:09:44,381 --> 00:09:46,849
Come on down, man.
Take a bow.

140
00:09:46,917 --> 00:09:48,885
Shut up, man.
lt's a classic.

141
00:09:48,952 --> 00:09:50,977
lt's a very beautiful story
about someone

142
00:09:51,054 --> 00:09:54,319
who feels unnoticed,
unappreciated, unloved, you know?

143
00:09:54,391 --> 00:09:56,256
- Turn it.
- lt's a good one, though.

144
00:09:56,326 --> 00:09:57,350

170
00:11:20,544 --> 00:11:22,569
l haven't been
to White Castle in ages.

171
00:11:22,646 --> 00:11:25,206
Dude, l'm telling you, there's one right by
that multiplex in New Brunswick.

172
00:11:25,282 --> 00:11:26,271
Nice.

173
00:11:26,349 --> 00:11:27,839
- Rosenberg!
- Goldstein!

174
00:11:28,485 --> 00:11:32,546
Yo, Manny and Shevitz, get up.
We're going to White Castle.

175
00:11:32,622 --> 00:11:35,420
No, we're watching
Tlhe Gift on HBO.

176
00:11:35,492 --> 00:11:37,255
No, no, no.
No watching. We're starving.

177
00:11:37,861 --> 00:11:39,556
Hey, put that back.

178
00:11:39,629 --> 00:11:41,893
No eating until we get
to White Castle. Let's roll.

179
00:11:41,965 --> 00:11:43,694
Sorry, kids,
we ain't going nowhere.

180
00:11:43,767 --> 00:11:45,997
Supposedly Katie Holmes
shows her titties in this movie.

181
00:11:46,069 --> 00:11:48,264
ls that all you Jews
ever think about--tits?

182
00:11:48,338 --> 00:11:51,739
Katie Holmes is a nice,
respectable, wholesome girl.

183
00:11:51,808 --> 00:11:54,641
And l'm gonna see her boobs.

184
00:11:54,711 --> 00:11:57,680
The things l would eat
out of her ass--you have no idea!

185
00:11:58,515 --> 00:12:00,278
That is
a completely vulgar statement.

186
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:03,285
So is ''l want to bang Britney Spears
on the bathroom floor.''

187
00:12:03,353 --> 00:12:05,116
But it's true.

188
00:12:05,188 --> 00:12:06,177
Touch¨¦.

189
00:12:06,256 --> 00:12:07,484
Hey, listen, if--

190
00:12:10,794 --> 00:12:12,591
l think Kumar's a faygele.

191
00:12:12,662 --> 00:12:14,789
They're totally gay for each other.

192
00:12:14,865 --> 00:12:17,231
- Hey, you wanna suck on this?
- Uh-huh.

193
00:12:19,035 --> 00:12:20,127
What the hell are you
bringing your bag for?

194
00:12:20,203 --> 00:12:22,262
Try to get some work done
in the car.

195
00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:24,739
- Here, you're driving.
- Shit, l forgot my cell phone.

196
00:12:24,808 --> 00:12:26,935
You wanna run back and get it?

197
00:12:32,549 --> 00:12:34,642
No, we've gone too far.

198
00:12:35,552 --> 00:12:37,486
Hey, there's your girlfriend.

199
00:12:37,554 --> 00:12:39,044
You gonna talk to her this time,

200
00:12:39,122 --> 00:12:41,317
or are you gonna be
a Vagina McGinastein about it?

201
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,221
What the hell are you doing?

202
00:12:44,294 --> 00:12:45,659
You could've asked her if she wanted
to come to White Castle with us.

203
00:12:45,729 --> 00:12:48,061
- Hold the elevator. Wait!
- Hey, how are--

204
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:51,391
You're worthless.

205
00:12:52,102 --> 00:12:53,694
l'm not worthwhile.

206
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:56,295
Just fucking talk to her once.
lt won't be weird anymore.

207
00:12:56,373 --> 00:12:57,772
Look, it doesn't matter.

208
00:12:57,841 --> 00:13:00,639
The only girls who are interested in me
are girls l have no interest in.

209
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:01,904
Like Cindy Kim.

210
00:13:01,978 --> 00:13:03,570
Speaking of Cindy,
she called earlier.

211
00:13:03,647 --> 00:13:06,309
One of those Asian clubs she's in
is throwing a party at her dorm tonight.

212
00:13:06,383 --> 00:13:08,442
God, she invites me to everything.

213
00:13:08,518 --> 00:13:11,681
So what? She's kind of fuckin' cute.
Let her touch your penis.

214
00:13:12,322 --> 00:13:13,687
Oh, look.

215
00:13:13,757 --> 00:13:15,816
lt's the Brothers McFag.

216
00:13:15,892 --> 00:13:18,520
Let me guess--the one
with the purse is the catcher.

217
00:13:19,863 --> 00:13:22,491
Come on, guys, let's get ourselves
some fucking Mountain Dew.

218
00:13:22,565 --> 00:13:23,554
Extreme!

219
00:13:23,633 --> 00:13:25,726
Yeah, extreme assholes.

220
00:13:25,802 --> 00:13:27,394
Why do l
have to be the catcher?

221
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:29,938
Dude, forget about those pricks.
Let's just get some food.

222
00:13:34,644 --> 00:13:37,738
l am so hungry. l'm gonna eat,
like, 20 of those burgers, man.

223
00:13:37,814 --> 00:13:42,444
Dude, fuckin' l will see your 20 burgers
and raise you 5 orders of fries.

224
00:13:44,654 --> 00:13:45,916
Dude, give me 35 cents.

225
00:13:52,929 --> 00:13:54,624
What's going on?
lt didn't register.

226
00:13:54,698 --> 00:13:56,928
- What?
- Give me 35 more cents.

227
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,231
- l don't have any more change.
- Should l just go through?

228
00:14:00,303 --> 00:14:02,794
No, no, l don't like
breaking the law.

229
00:14:02,872 --> 00:14:04,396
Yeah, l can see that.

230
00:14:05,608 --> 00:14:08,076
Hey, move your ass!

231
00:14:08,144 --> 00:14:10,271
- l'm sorry. Hold on.
- l'm going through.

232
00:14:10,347 --> 00:14:12,042
No, don't.
No. No. Hold on.

233
00:14:12,115 --> 00:14:14,982
Let me walk to a manned tollbooth
and l'll tell them what happened.

234
00:14:15,051 --> 00:14:17,986
- Sorry!
- Move, you fuckin' twat!

235
00:14:18,054 --> 00:14:20,022
- What's the fuckin' holdup here?
- Shit.

236
00:14:22,258 --> 00:14:24,988
Move, you retarded cocksucker!
Move!

237
00:14:25,795 --> 00:14:28,025
- Are you crazy?
- What?

238
00:14:29,499 --> 00:14:30,864
What are you doing?
Why you throwing the weed out?!

239
00:14:30,934 --> 00:14:33,164
- The cops are gonna catch us.
- No, they're not. Not for that.

240
00:14:33,236 --> 00:14:34,294
- Take this exit.
- What?

241
00:14:34,371 --> 00:14:35,531
- Take this exit!
- No!

242
00:14:35,605 --> 00:14:36,970
Dude!

243
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,803
You know,
that was the last of our weed.

244
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:41,366
Sorry. l get a little
paranoid sometimes.

245
00:14:41,444 --> 00:14:43,173
Now we're in Newark,
of all places.

246
00:14:43,246 --> 00:14:45,111
You know we're
gonna get shot.

247
00:14:45,181 --> 00:14:48,776
Maybe it's not as bad as they say.
Maybe it's just a bunch of hype.

248
00:14:48,852 --> 00:14:51,650
Check it out. Those guys
look like a lame version of us.

249
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,354
- Holy shit!
- Holy shit!

250
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,891
Let's get the fuck outta here.

251
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:10,196
- Go! Go! Drive! Drive!
- Yeah, that was your fault.

252
00:15:10,273 --> 00:15:11,797
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

253
00:15:14,811 --> 00:15:16,176
Yo, check it out.
We're almost there.

254
00:15:16,246 --> 00:15:17,770
Thank God. l'm starving.

255
00:15:17,847 --> 00:15:21,840
- Hello, New Brunswick!
- Prepare to gorge yourself.

256
00:15:21,918 --> 00:15:24,250
You know--
We need some tunage for this.

257
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,878
Presets. Use the presets.

258
00:15:25,955 --> 00:15:27,820
Oh, come on, dude,
your whole life is preset.

259
00:15:27,891 --> 00:15:29,256
Try something new.

260
00:15:31,127 --> 00:15:33,891
Where is this place? lsn't it
supposed to be right around here?

261
00:15:33,963 --> 00:15:36,488
- Chill. We'll find it.
- Wait a second--is that the multiplex?

262
00:15:36,566 --> 00:15:38,124
- Yes.
- Sweet!

263
00:15:38,201 --> 00:15:40,795
That means the White Castle
should be right around the corner.

264
00:15:42,539 --> 00:15:43,904
What the hell
is going on, Kumar?

265
00:15:43,973 --> 00:15:45,736
That does not look
like a White Castle to me.

266
00:15:45,809 --> 00:15:48,334
Uh-uh.
Dude, we gotta check this out.

267
00:15:53,116 --> 00:15:56,483
Hey, look here, fellas. You guys gonna
have to order from the drive-thru menu.

268
00:15:56,553 --> 00:15:58,578
What happened to the White Castle?

269
00:15:58,655 --> 00:15:59,644
What?

270
00:15:59,722 --> 00:16:01,622
There used to be a White Castle
right here in this location.

271
00:16:01,691 --> 00:16:02,680
Where is it?

272
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:04,693
l hate to be the bearer
of bad news, guys,

273
00:16:04,761 --> 00:16:07,161
but Burger Shack, they bought
this location about four years ago.

274
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,219
God!

275
00:16:08,298 --> 00:16:10,061
Please tell me there's
another White Castle in town.

276
00:16:10,133 --> 00:16:11,691
- No.
- Are you sure?

277
00:16:11,768 --> 00:16:12,792
Do l look like the kind of brother

278
00:16:12,869 --> 00:16:14,427
that would be unsure
about something like that?

279
00:16:14,504 --> 00:16:16,870
Shit!
What are we gonna do?

280
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,500
l don't know, man.
Should we just eat here?

281
00:16:19,576 --> 00:16:20,565
Hey. Psst.

282
00:16:22,278 --> 00:16:25,736
There's a White Castle that's
open 24 hours up in Cherry Hill.

283
00:16:25,815 --> 00:16:27,214
lt's about
45 minutes from here.

284
00:16:27,283 --> 00:16:29,046
l can make the trip
if you're willing to.

285
00:16:29,119 --> 00:16:30,848
Kumar, l got a shitload
of work to finish.

286
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,410
You got that
med school interview.

287
00:16:32,489 --> 00:16:34,787
Forget about the med school
interview. lt's a non-issue.

288
00:16:34,858 --> 00:16:36,348
What do you mean
it's a non-issue?

289
00:16:36,426 --> 00:16:39,589
Ding-dong!
May l interject for a second?

290
00:16:39,662 --> 00:16:42,756
As a Burger Shack employee
for the past three years,

291
00:16:42,832 --> 00:16:45,824
if there's one thing l've learned,
it's that if you're craving White Castle,

292
00:16:45,902 --> 00:16:47,563
the burgers here
just don't cut it.

293
00:16:48,538 --> 00:16:54,272
ln fact, just thinking about those
tender little White Castle burgers

294
00:16:54,344 --> 00:16:56,312
with those little, itty-bitty grilled onions

295
00:16:56,379 --> 00:16:58,609
that just explode
in your mouth like flavor crystals

296
00:16:58,681 --> 00:17:00,171
every time you bite into one...

297
00:17:02,785 --> 00:17:05,413
...just makes me want
to burn this motherfucker down.

298
00:17:06,523 --> 00:17:09,651
Come on, Pookie,
let's burn this motherfucker down!

299
00:17:09,726 --> 00:17:12,126
Come on, Pookie!
Let's burn it, Pookie!

300
00:17:12,195 --> 00:17:14,163
Let's burn this
motherfucker down!

301
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:16,824
Let's burn it down!
Let's burn it!

302
00:17:19,435 --> 00:17:23,599
So you guys maybe should just
suck it up and go to White Castle.

303
00:17:24,974 --> 00:17:28,273
You can always get
your work done in the car.

304
00:17:28,811 --> 00:17:30,608
- Let's do it.
- All right. Awesome.

305
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,843
Then listen, listen--no matter what,
we are not ending this night

306
00:17:33,917 --> 00:17:35,384
without White Castle
in our stomachs.

307
00:17:35,451 --> 00:17:36,645
- Agreed?
- Agreed.

308
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,348
Wise choice.

309
00:17:38,421 --> 00:17:40,480
You guys might have
wanted to stay away

310
00:17:40,557 --> 00:17:42,923
from our special sauce tonight.

311
00:17:42,992 --> 00:17:45,620
Me and Pookie,
we added a secret ingredient.

312
00:17:47,897 --> 00:17:49,888
l'll give you a hint.

313
00:17:51,935 --> 00:17:53,027
lt's semen.

314
00:17:56,706 --> 00:17:57,798
Semen.

315
00:17:57,874 --> 00:17:59,205
Animal semen.

316
00:18:08,184 --> 00:18:11,483
Dude, remember when Goldstein
used to work at that burger place?

317
00:18:14,624 --> 00:18:17,058
This is the most fucking confusing
movie l've ever seen--

318
00:18:17,126 --> 00:18:18,718
she's possessed,
she's not possessed.

319
00:18:18,795 --> 00:18:20,558
Dude, that rack better be stacked.

320
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:22,894
- Tits! Tits!
- Boobies, boobies, boobies.

321
00:18:22,966 --> 00:18:25,161
Holy shit! Whoa!

322
00:18:25,235 --> 00:18:26,532
Those aren't real.
Yes, they are.

323
00:18:26,869 --> 00:18:29,360
You know, l'm almost
completely sober right now.

324
00:18:29,439 --> 00:18:31,464
l wish we had some more weed.

325
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:33,133
Sorry.

326
00:18:33,209 --> 00:18:35,507
Princeton.

327
00:18:35,578 --> 00:18:37,478
- We're getting off here.
- Why?

328
00:18:37,547 --> 00:18:40,243
Because we're gonna sweet-talk
Cindy Kim into finding us some weed.

329
00:18:40,316 --> 00:18:41,305
- No.
- Why not?

330
00:18:41,384 --> 00:18:42,942
You talk to her on the phone
all the time.

331
00:18:43,019 --> 00:18:44,577
She calls me.
Then she rambles on

332
00:18:44,654 --> 00:18:47,452
about her East Asian
Students Club or whatever.

333
00:18:47,523 --> 00:18:48,854
Then l have to actually pretend
that l give a shit

334
00:18:48,925 --> 00:18:50,256
or else she calls me a Twinkie.

335
00:18:50,326 --> 00:18:51,520
A what?

336
00:18:51,594 --> 00:18:54,256
Twinkie--yellow on the outside,
white on the inside.

337
00:18:54,831 --> 00:18:56,093
Look, you Twinkie bitch,

338
00:18:56,165 --> 00:18:58,326
you were the one that threw
our weed out the window, okay?

339
00:18:58,401 --> 00:18:59,425
So we're going to Princeton,

340
00:18:59,502 --> 00:19:01,060
and it's your responsibility
to make sure we're high as shit

341
00:19:01,137 --> 00:19:02,900
by the time
we're eating those burgers.

342
00:19:02,972 --> 00:19:05,770
Forget it.
End of discussion.

343
00:19:05,842 --> 00:19:08,436
l am not seeing Cindy Kim.

344
00:19:08,511 --> 00:19:10,274
Harold, l'm so glad
you showed up.

345
00:19:10,346 --> 00:19:12,610
Yeah, me too.

346
00:19:12,682 --> 00:19:15,845
Did you like the hibiscus petals
l glued to the envelope l sent you?

347
00:19:15,918 --> 00:19:18,546
Yeah, they were nice.

348
00:19:20,123 --> 00:19:22,250
Hey, dude, you know
where l can get some green?

349
00:19:25,094 --> 00:19:27,756
Dude, you know where
l can get some chronic?

350
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:30,264
Jesus, what the hell kind of
lvy League school is this?

351
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,664
Man.

352
00:19:31,734 --> 00:19:32,996
Over here, man.

353
00:19:34,137 --> 00:19:35,468
You lookin' to toke up?

354
00:19:35,538 --> 00:19:36,903
- Yes.
- Yes?

355
00:19:36,973 --> 00:19:39,669
Thank Christ. Just give me
a dime of your finest sticky.

356
00:19:39,742 --> 00:19:43,143
You wanna see
sticky-icky, my friend?

357
00:19:44,814 --> 00:19:45,906
Oh, my God!

358
00:19:45,982 --> 00:19:47,574
Whoa, man!

359
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:49,584
Don't touch, man.
That's not cool.

360
00:19:49,652 --> 00:19:51,313
You can't--

361
00:19:51,387 --> 00:19:53,446
Jeez! This is my baby!

362
00:20:00,163 --> 00:20:01,152
Yes?

363
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:03,221
Kenneth Park,
class of 2004.

364
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:04,288
- Hi.
- Hi.

365
00:20:04,367 --> 00:20:06,892
ls it true you're an analyst
for Brewster Keegan?

366
00:20:08,371 --> 00:20:09,770
Yes, l'm a junior analyst.

367
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:11,306
Awesome!

368
00:20:13,309 --> 00:20:14,833
l told you, he's good.

369
00:20:18,981 --> 00:20:21,745
- Yes.
- This is actually a two-part question.

370
00:20:21,818 --> 00:20:24,150
l'm applying for a summer
internship at Brewster Keegan.

371
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:27,519
l was wondering, a) what's it like
being an investment banker,

372
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:30,218
and b) would you write me
a recommendation?

373
00:20:32,395 --> 00:20:34,659
Here. That's sixt--80 bucks.

374
00:20:34,731 --> 00:20:36,130
- 80 bucks?
- Yeah, 80 bucks.

375
00:20:36,199 --> 00:20:38,667
Yo, this is worth 40 tops, bro.

376
00:20:38,735 --> 00:20:40,635
''Bro''?
l'm not your bro, bro.

377
00:20:40,703 --> 00:20:42,170
Okay, and that's 80 bucks.

378
00:20:42,238 --> 00:20:43,796
You don't feel like
getting high tonight?

379
00:20:43,873 --> 00:20:46,671
lf you don't feel like getting high,
that's cool with me,

380
00:20:46,743 --> 00:20:48,802
because there's lots of people
around here. See this guy?

381
00:20:48,878 --> 00:20:49,867
Hey, loser.

382
00:20:49,946 --> 00:20:52,471
Hey, what's up, George?
l smoke buds with George all the time.

383
00:20:52,548 --> 00:20:54,516
What kind of hippie are you?

384
00:20:54,584 --> 00:20:57,212
What kind of hippie am l?
Man, l'm a business hippie.

385
00:20:57,286 --> 00:20:59,550
l understand the concept
of supply and demand.

386
00:20:59,622 --> 00:21:02,352
''What's it like
being an investment banker?''

387
00:21:02,425 --> 00:21:06,088
To be honest with you,
it's actually pretty aw...

388
00:21:09,532 --> 00:21:11,227
...awesome.

389
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,289
Excellent!

390
00:21:12,368 --> 00:21:15,997
As for the recommendation,
l guess l can make a couple calls.

391
00:21:16,072 --> 00:21:18,506
Actually, Harold, we should
be getting to the party.

392
00:21:18,574 --> 00:21:20,041
We can discuss all this stuff
on the way there.

393
00:21:20,109 --> 00:21:21,667
- lt's just down the hall.
- Okay.

394
00:21:21,744 --> 00:21:25,703
l'm sorry. l can't go.
l have to wait for Kumar.

395
00:21:25,782 --> 00:21:27,272
You'll see him when we're done.

396
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:29,511
Trust me,
you're gonna love this.

397
00:21:29,585 --> 00:21:32,281
Kenny's mom dropped off
a big pot of kimchi jigae.

398
00:21:32,355 --> 00:21:34,846
lt's really good.
lt's delicious.

399
00:21:34,924 --> 00:21:35,982
Yeah?

400
00:21:36,058 --> 00:21:37,685
That's nice.

401
00:21:38,194 --> 00:21:40,185
- 80 bucks, okay?
- Okay.

402
00:21:40,263 --> 00:21:43,323
- Hello.

403
00:21:43,399 --> 00:21:46,334
Yes, we're gonna smoke. Do you
wanna come back to my place?

404
00:21:46,402 --> 00:21:49,303
Please, like they want to go listen
to a bunch of Phish records

405
00:21:49,372 --> 00:21:51,567
while you read
your lame-ass poetry.

406
00:21:51,641 --> 00:21:53,199
Girls, you guys wanna hang out,

407
00:21:53,276 --> 00:21:55,369
maybe smoke a little weed
and have some fun?

408
00:21:55,445 --> 00:21:57,413
- All right.
- All right.

409
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,345
My poetry's not lame.
lt's really good.

410
00:21:59,415 --> 00:22:01,315
- Yeah, l'm sure.
- lt's great.

411
00:22:01,384 --> 00:22:03,011
We're gonna eat before this gets cold.

412
00:22:03,085 --> 00:22:06,179
What you say we meet back
in our room in about 20 minutes?

413
00:22:06,255 --> 00:22:07,688
We're in room 109.

414
00:22:07,757 --> 00:22:11,193
109. Got it.

415
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,557

00:22:12,628 --> 00:22:16,792
109. We'll see
you ladies later. Yes!

417
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:18,664
We're getting laid, bro.

418
00:22:22,205 --> 00:22:24,105
All right, l'll see you there, man.

00:22:28,644 --> 00:22:30,976
208. Yes! 208!

421
00:22:32,114 --> 00:22:34,105
Roldy, dude,
you gotta come quick.

422
00:22:34,183 --> 00:22:37,983
There's these two filthy pussies
just aching to get boned by us.

423
00:22:39,021 --> 00:22:42,320
l mean, there are these two
very lovely young pussies

424

a chat with you and l.

425
00:22:44,393 --> 00:22:46,884
Sorry. Harold's coming with us.

426
00:22:46,963 --> 00:22:49,090
That's bullshit. He's coming with me.
lsn't that right, Roldy?

427
00:22:50,199 --> 00:22:51,928
- Let's go to the party.
- No, no, no. Fuck that.

428
00:22:52,001 --> 00:22:55,164
Here. This is Harold's understudy.
You can do whatever you want.

429
00:22:55,238 --> 00:22:56,500
Roldy, let's go.

430
00:22:57,507 --> 00:22:58,735
Sorry.

431
00:22:58,808 --> 00:23:00,639
l can't believe you were gonna
ditch me for the Joy Luck Club.

432
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:02,143
You know what their parties are like.

433
00:23:02,211 --> 00:23:04,509
What do you want me to say?
l was under pressure.

434
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:06,605
Just say no.
That's all it takes. Here.

435
00:23:06,682 --> 00:23:07,944
All right, take a hit of that.

436
00:23:08,017 --> 00:23:09,314
What's going on up there?

437
00:23:09,385 --> 00:23:11,785
Barracuda to Sparrow,
Barracuda to Sparrow.

438
00:23:11,854 --> 00:23:14,345
We got two high-fliers
on level three.

439
00:23:18,494 --> 00:23:20,985
l just wanna talk!

440
00:23:23,766 --> 00:23:25,199
Dude, in here, in here.

Women!

442
00:23:26,836 --> 00:23:28,667
What if someone
finds us in here?

443
00:23:28,738 --> 00:23:31,229
Chill the fuck out. He's not gonna
look for us in the girls' bathroom.

444
00:23:33,809 --> 00:23:35,174
Shit! Come here.

445
00:23:35,811 --> 00:23:38,575
lt worked on me. There's no reason
it shouldn't work on you.

446
00:23:38,648 --> 00:23:41,173
But your breasts look beautiful.

447
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:44,151
l just want those
cute little ping-pong breasts.

448
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,154
You know, that kind of go...

449
00:23:47,957 --> 00:23:49,788
Hurry up because l want
to go smoke weed

450
00:23:49,859 --> 00:23:51,656
with that dishy lndian guy.

451
00:23:51,727 --> 00:23:53,592
lt's gonna be a few minutes.

452
00:23:53,663 --> 00:23:57,155
l'm about to have
the worst case of taco shits.

453
00:23:57,233 --> 00:23:58,666
Oh, God.

454
00:24:05,074 --> 00:24:07,099
Great, l think l've got
to go, too.

455
00:24:24,927 --> 00:24:28,260
Hey, Clarissa, do you want
to play battle shits?

456
00:24:28,331 --> 00:24:30,697
- Oh, my God!
- Battle shits?

457
00:24:30,766 --> 00:24:33,758
We haven't played that
since back at camp.

458
00:24:33,836 --> 00:24:35,804
l know, l know.
Wait for it.

459
00:24:41,577 --> 00:24:42,874
Hit.

460
00:24:45,982 --> 00:24:48,280
Scag! You sank my destroyer!

461
00:24:57,293 --> 00:24:58,282
Fuck!

462
00:25:00,029 --> 00:25:02,293
l can't take it anymore!

463
00:25:05,601 --> 00:25:07,068
Christy, are you still there?

464
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:13,138
Damn! You sank my battle shit!

465
00:25:13,209 --> 00:25:14,699
Shit.

466
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,204
Dude!

467
00:25:21,117 --> 00:25:23,085
She said in 20-10?

468
00:25:23,152 --> 00:25:25,382
Have you seen
a Korean guy around here?

469
00:25:25,454 --> 00:25:28,321
Yeah, only when
l open my eyes, though.

470
00:25:29,392 --> 00:25:30,586
'Tard.

471
00:25:33,329 --> 00:25:35,354
20-1 1 .

472
00:25:43,539 --> 00:25:44,972
Yo, this party's bumpin'!

473
00:25:45,041 --> 00:25:47,805
- Who wants some Buda?
- Yeah!

474
00:25:47,877 --> 00:25:51,438
Holy shit! Kenneth Park,
class of 2004.

475
00:25:51,514 --> 00:25:54,745
Dude, l'm thinking you really screwed up
by not coming to this party.

476
00:25:54,817 --> 00:25:56,478
l screwed up?

477
00:25:56,552 --> 00:25:58,452
Can we have some pot brownies?

478
00:25:58,521 --> 00:26:00,614
l don't know.
l'm running a little low.

479
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:02,055
A titty flash might persuade me.

480
00:26:02,124 --> 00:26:04,217
- Should we?
- l think you should.

481
00:26:04,293 --> 00:26:05,453
Okay.

482
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:09,122
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

483
00:26:09,198 --> 00:26:10,358
Hey, you!

484
00:26:11,167 --> 00:26:12,225
Shit!

485
00:26:12,301 --> 00:26:14,166
Hey!

486
00:26:15,504 --> 00:26:17,335
- Hey!
- Let's get 'em! Halt!

487
00:26:17,406 --> 00:26:19,670
- Hey.
- Hey.

488
00:26:19,742 --> 00:26:21,903
- Harold! Harold!
- No, no, no.

489
00:26:22,945 --> 00:26:24,378
- Hey, dude!
- Come here!

490
00:26:26,882 --> 00:26:28,372
Well, well, well.

491
00:26:28,451 --> 00:26:30,248
- What do we have here?
- Oh, no! That's my baby!

492
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:32,651
Hold his throat and groin.
Come on, rookie.

493
00:26:32,722 --> 00:26:34,314
Should we go back
for the weed?

494
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:35,789
Are you crazy?
Run! Run!

495
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:41,052
l can't believe it, man.
We were this close to getting laid.

496
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:42,563
Oh, dude,
you always exaggerate.

497
00:26:42,631 --> 00:26:45,099
The diarrhea twins definitely
would have had sex with us.

498
00:26:45,167 --> 00:26:47,567
What about Cindy? She was
looking kinda cute tonight, man.

499
00:26:47,636 --> 00:26:49,866
Cindy's fine.
lt's just...

500
00:26:49,939 --> 00:26:50,928
- Just what?
- We--

501
00:26:51,006 --> 00:26:52,633
Oh, you'd rather have Maria.

502
00:26:52,708 --> 00:26:53,697
Look, it doesn't matter.

503
00:26:53,776 --> 00:26:56,040
l'm gonna end up with Cindy Kim
whether l like it or not.

504
00:26:56,112 --> 00:26:59,206
Can we just drop this and get
our asses to White Castle, man?

505
00:26:59,281 --> 00:27:01,408
Fine.
Maria.

506
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,714
What are you doing?

507
00:27:05,788 --> 00:27:07,847
Daddy needs to urinate.

508
00:27:08,791 --> 00:27:09,883
Hurry up!

509
00:27:11,794 --> 00:27:13,421
l'm serious.
Don't take all night.

510
00:27:13,496 --> 00:27:14,929
All right.

511
00:27:56,305 --> 00:27:58,773
- Excuse me, l have to--
- Huh?

512
00:27:58,841 --> 00:28:02,834
l have to ask you.
Why are you peeing right here?

513
00:28:02,912 --> 00:28:04,106
What?

514
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:06,842
l mean, why'd you pee
right next to me

515
00:28:06,916 --> 00:28:09,180
when you could choose
that bush or...

516
00:28:09,251 --> 00:28:11,219
This is a good bush to pee on.

517
00:28:12,221 --> 00:28:14,746
Why are you peeing on it?

518
00:28:14,824 --> 00:28:16,951
Well, no one was here
when l chose this bush.

519
00:28:17,026 --> 00:28:18,152
Oh.

520
00:28:18,227 --> 00:28:21,094
So you get to pee on it
and no one else does? Huh?

521
00:28:21,163 --> 00:28:23,495
- No, l just--
- This your bush?

522
00:28:23,566 --> 00:28:26,034
You have a special bond
with this bush?

523
00:28:26,101 --> 00:28:29,036
- No, l just thought that--
- You the king of the forest?

524
00:28:29,104 --> 00:28:30,332
- l'm sorry?
- What?

525
00:28:30,406 --> 00:28:34,103
Are you a fuckin' tree-hugger?
ls this your special bush?!

526
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:36,701
Never mind. Forget it. l really
don't feel like getting stabbed tonight.

527
00:28:42,251 --> 00:28:43,479
Nice pubes.

528
00:28:47,223 --> 00:28:48,212
Thanks.

529
00:29:11,547 --> 00:29:13,538
Do you even know
where you're going?

530
00:29:13,616 --> 00:29:15,709
l'm gonna be honest,
l'm a little lost, but, you know,

531
00:29:15,784 --> 00:29:17,877
once we get back on the highway,
we'll be there soon, don't worry.

532
00:29:17,953 --> 00:29:19,284
We'd better.

533
00:29:20,389 --> 00:29:22,584
Shit. Now it's raining.

534
00:29:23,425 --> 00:29:24,722
Put on your wipers.

535
00:29:24,793 --> 00:29:26,351
What are you talking about?
lt's just a little mist.

536
00:29:26,428 --> 00:29:28,692
Yeah, mist,
hence the mist setting.

537
00:29:28,764 --> 00:29:31,392
lt's a safety issue, okay?
There we go.

538
00:29:31,467 --> 00:29:34,732
Thank you, Mr. Wizard.
What crawled up your ass?

539
00:29:34,803 --> 00:29:37,203
l'm completely on edge
right now, man.

540
00:29:37,273 --> 00:29:38,865
After all the shit that
we've been through tonight,

541
00:29:38,941 --> 00:29:40,932
l don't know
how much more l can take.

542
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:43,942
Oh, shit! How the fuck
did that get in here?

543
00:29:44,013 --> 00:29:45,105
Oh, shit!

544
00:29:48,817 --> 00:29:51,547
He bit me!
l've got rabies!

545
00:29:53,155 --> 00:29:54,144
Oh, my God!

546
00:29:54,223 --> 00:29:56,384
Dude, get that fuckin'
cancer raccoon away from me!

547
00:29:56,458 --> 00:29:57,925
Open my window!

548
00:29:57,993 --> 00:30:00,587
Fuck you, raccoon!

549
00:30:03,032 --> 00:30:04,624
What the Christ?

550
00:30:05,367 --> 00:30:08,393
- Shit!
- Shit!

551
00:30:11,941 --> 00:30:13,772
Jesus! You all right?

552
00:30:13,842 --> 00:30:16,003
l don't know.

553
00:30:16,779 --> 00:30:18,178
Shit.

554
00:30:18,714 --> 00:30:20,272
Shit, dude,
he's coming over here.

555
00:30:21,383 --> 00:30:23,146
Probably some old blind bitch!

556
00:30:23,218 --> 00:30:27,120
- What the fuck are you doing?
- We're sorry. We're very sorry!

557
00:30:27,189 --> 00:30:29,919
- Holy shit!
- Goldstein?

558
00:30:29,992 --> 00:30:31,960
Dude, it's Rold and Kumar.

559
00:30:32,027 --> 00:30:34,587
Shit. What's going on, man?

560
00:30:34,663 --> 00:30:37,257
- What's up, dude? What's up?
- All right.

561
00:30:37,333 --> 00:30:38,732
What the hell
are you guys doing here?

562
00:30:38,801 --> 00:30:41,827
We got the munchies, so we
decided we'd go to Hot Dog Heaven.

563
00:30:41,904 --> 00:30:43,804
How about you?
How was White Castle?

564
00:30:43,872 --> 00:30:46,500
We haven't gotten there yet.
l think l may have rabies.

565
00:30:46,575 --> 00:30:48,509
Yo, dude, how were
Katie Holmes' tits?

566
00:30:48,577 --> 00:30:50,568
- You know the Holocaust?
- Yeah.

567
00:30:50,646 --> 00:30:52,580
Picture the exact
opposite of that.

568
00:30:52,648 --> 00:30:54,309
Nice.

569
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:56,547
Boy, do you need a girl.

570
00:30:56,618 --> 00:30:58,279
lf you guys
got the yellow fever,

571
00:30:58,354 --> 00:31:00,219
there's a rockin' Asian party
down at Princeton.

572
00:31:00,289 --> 00:31:01,654
Dude, l got the yellow plague.

573
00:31:01,724 --> 00:31:04,591
There's nothing sexier
than a hot Asian chick!

574
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,321
Asian tits--
l wanna squeeze 'em!

575
00:31:06,395 --> 00:31:08,829
Stop. Don't do that.
Please, do not touch me.

576
00:31:08,897 --> 00:31:10,023
l'm very woozy.

577
00:31:10,099 --> 00:31:12,090
l think l have to go
to the hospital.

578
00:31:12,167 --> 00:31:14,158
You should go
to Beth lsrael.

579
00:31:14,236 --> 00:31:16,568
- We gotta hit up this Asian joint.
- No, we don't.

580
00:31:16,638 --> 00:31:19,971
We got to go to Hot Dog Heaven.
No more detours along the way.

581
00:31:20,042 --> 00:31:21,839
- This is what l'm dealing with.
- Come on!

582
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:23,207
l'm telling you,
hit up the Asian party.

583
00:31:23,278 --> 00:31:25,109
Did you leave the key in the car
with the engine running?

584
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,272
Good luck.

585
00:31:26,348 --> 00:31:29,545
You don't have rabies. We're not
going to a hospital. You're fine.

586
00:31:40,229 --> 00:31:43,198
Uh... Yeah, l don't have rabies.

587
00:31:43,265 --> 00:31:45,893
Great. Let's just
get out of here.

588
00:31:46,869 --> 00:31:50,396
Hey, aren't those the guys
that got the shit kicked--

589
00:31:50,472 --> 00:31:53,236
l know. l know.
Let's just go.

590
00:31:54,943 --> 00:31:56,501
Just go.

591
00:31:57,179 --> 00:31:58,441
Kumar.

592
00:32:00,349 --> 00:32:02,510
- Hey, it's your dad and brother.
- Shit.

593
00:32:03,719 --> 00:32:06,381
No wonder you didn't want
to go to the hospital.

594
00:32:06,455 --> 00:32:07,979
- Hey, Dad.
- Hi, Dr. Patel.

595
00:32:08,057 --> 00:32:10,025
- What's up?
- Saikat. What's going on?

596
00:32:10,092 --> 00:32:13,357
l hope you are here to apologize for
what you did in your interview today.

597
00:32:13,429 --> 00:32:15,021
What the hell's
wrong with you, Kumar?

598
00:32:15,097 --> 00:32:17,429
God! You're 22 years old.
When are you gonna grow up

599
00:32:17,499 --> 00:32:20,491
and stop this
post-college rebel bullshit?

600
00:32:20,569 --> 00:32:23,402
- Like your life is so hard.
- Eat my balls, Saikat.

601
00:32:23,472 --> 00:32:26,236
l will not tolerate this
business from you any longer.

602
00:32:26,308 --> 00:32:29,038
You have one more
interview tomorrow morning,

603
00:32:29,111 --> 00:32:33,775
and if l hear from Dr. Wein that you
were anything short of spectacular,

604
00:32:33,849 --> 00:32:35,646
l'll completely cut you off.

605
00:32:35,717 --> 00:32:37,776
- Dad, come on.
- Daddy is not coming on anything.

606
00:32:39,955 --> 00:32:42,583
You will be there,
and you will behave.

607
00:32:42,658 --> 00:32:46,059
l have put too much time
and energy into you

608
00:32:46,128 --> 00:32:48,892
to let you go
and fuck it all up!

609
00:32:56,472 --> 00:32:59,168
You're absolutely right.
l'm sorry, guys.

610
00:32:59,241 --> 00:33:00,572
Wow, l'm sorry.

611
00:33:02,377 --> 00:33:04,743
Sorry.
lt won't happen again, okay?

612
00:33:06,348 --> 00:33:07,838
Good.

613
00:33:07,916 --> 00:33:09,611
l will speak with you tomorrow.

614
00:33:09,685 --> 00:33:12,051
- Bye, Harold.
- Bye.

615
00:33:12,121 --> 00:33:13,383
See ya.

616
00:33:13,455 --> 00:33:14,752
Wow, man.

617
00:33:14,823 --> 00:33:16,984
l guess you're going
to med school after all, eh?

618
00:33:17,059 --> 00:33:20,119
Fuck that, dude.
Like l care what my dad thinks.

619
00:33:20,195 --> 00:33:21,457
l can't wait to see
the look on his face

620
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:22,963
when he finds out l didn't go
to my interview tomorrow.

621
00:33:23,031 --> 00:33:25,431
lf he wants to cut me off, fine.
l don't need his money.

622
00:33:25,501 --> 00:33:28,265
l don't understand.
You just hugged him.

623
00:33:28,337 --> 00:33:31,738
Yeah, l just needed to get
my hands on this.

624
00:33:31,807 --> 00:33:32,967
Access card.

625
00:33:33,041 --> 00:33:36,101
Two words for you, bro--
medical marijuana.

626
00:33:37,179 --> 00:33:38,203
No.

627
00:33:39,448 --> 00:33:41,712
Oh, this is stolen.

628
00:33:43,152 --> 00:33:45,143
lf we get caught,
you are taking the blame.

629
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,619
This is not my idea.

630
00:33:46,688 --> 00:33:48,883
We're not gonna get caught, okay?
We're gonna go get baked

631
00:33:48,957 --> 00:33:51,517
and then go eat just like we planned.
Now, just calm down.

632
00:33:51,593 --> 00:33:53,857
- We gotta find the pharmacy.
- Dr. Patel!

633
00:33:53,929 --> 00:33:55,794
Thank God l found you.
We have an emergency.

634
00:33:55,864 --> 00:33:58,458
Nurses, l need these two doctors
scrubbed, gloved,

635
00:33:58,534 --> 00:34:00,593
and ready for the O.R. stat!

636
00:34:00,769 --> 00:34:03,237
- What the hell is going on?
- He probably thinks l'm my brother.

637
00:34:03,305 --> 00:34:05,637
Just don't worry about it.
Leave the talking to me.

638
00:34:05,707 --> 00:34:08,005
lt's a godforsaken bloodbath.

639
00:34:08,076 --> 00:34:10,704
The patient was brought in
by EMS five minutes ago.

640
00:34:10,779 --> 00:34:13,077
As you can see, we have
three horrific gunshot wounds.

641
00:34:13,148 --> 00:34:14,137
lt's a good thing
l found you two.

642
00:34:14,216 --> 00:34:15,877
All the other surgeons
are working on other patients.

643
00:34:15,951 --> 00:34:17,543
No, there's been a mistake.

644
00:34:17,619 --> 00:34:20,611
What Dr. Lee is trying to say
is that we need to sedate the patient...

645
00:34:20,689 --> 00:34:23,214
- ...or he could go into cardiac arrest.
- All right, l'll get the anesthesiologist.

646
00:34:23,292 --> 00:34:25,624
Hang on a second, nurse. What we
should probably use is marijuana.

647
00:34:25,694 --> 00:34:27,821
That'll sufficiently
sedate the patient for surgery.

648
00:34:33,869 --> 00:34:35,496
Marijuana?

649
00:34:36,371 --> 00:34:37,360
But why?

650
00:34:37,439 --> 00:34:38,929
We don't have time for questions.

651
00:34:39,007 --> 00:34:41,737
We need marijuana now,
as much of it as possible!

652
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:43,243
Like a big bag of it.

653
00:34:43,312 --> 00:34:47,078
But, Doctor, we don't have
marijuana in this hospital.

654
00:34:47,149 --> 00:34:48,912
Shit.

655
00:34:48,984 --> 00:34:52,010
Oh, shit!
This guy's gonna die!

656
00:34:52,087 --> 00:34:54,555
Doctor, you've got to do something
or we're gonna lose him!

657
00:34:54,623 --> 00:34:56,090
l'm gonna do this
the old-fashioned way.

658
00:34:56,158 --> 00:34:58,388
Start the nitrous.
Give me two large-bore l.V.s

659
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,325
and start a Ringers lactate push.

660
00:35:00,395 --> 00:35:01,419
Dr. Roldy, hold this.

661
00:35:07,502 --> 00:35:08,730
More gauze, please.

662
00:35:08,804 --> 00:35:12,171
- Doctor, the patient is desatting.
- Dude, he's desatting! He's desatting!

663
00:35:12,241 --> 00:35:15,039
The patient has a collapsed lung.
l need a 1 4-gauge angiocath stat.

664
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:24,350
- That was genius.
- Thank you.

665
00:35:24,419 --> 00:35:26,216
- Great job!
- You guys did it.

666
00:35:26,288 --> 00:35:27,346
No, it's you.

667
00:35:28,857 --> 00:35:31,155
- Sexy.
- What'd you say?

668
00:35:31,226 --> 00:35:32,386
Nothing.

669
00:35:32,461 --> 00:35:33,553
Sweet-pea.

670
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:37,623
The patient appears
to be stabilized.

671
00:35:37,699 --> 00:35:40,395
- Good work, doctors, all around.
- Great. One of you clean this up, please.

672
00:35:40,469 --> 00:35:42,733
- Put the chest tube in.
- Meow. You're moist.

673
00:35:42,804 --> 00:35:45,102
- l'm not sweating anymore.
- You're glistening.

674
00:35:45,173 --> 00:35:47,971
Soft and chocolate lips...

675
00:35:48,043 --> 00:35:51,809
- Could l get a little dab here?
- Hush now, hush now.

676
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,314
Excuse me, sir.
Do you happen to know

677
00:35:54,383 --> 00:35:56,442
how to get to the White Castle
in Cherry Hill from here?

678
00:35:56,518 --> 00:36:01,319
Yeah. Take the 33 west
and take the Turnpike south,

679
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:02,687
and there you are.

680
00:36:03,025 --> 00:36:04,925
l'm telling you, man,
that was amazing!

681
00:36:04,993 --> 00:36:06,688
Even your dad would
have been impressed, man.

682
00:36:06,762 --> 00:36:08,389
Yeah, it wasn't that bad.

683
00:36:08,463 --> 00:36:12,832
This is perfect. We're back on the road,
we got directions, it stopped raining.

684
00:36:12,901 --> 00:36:14,095
And guess what, man.

685
00:36:14,169 --> 00:36:17,900
- l'm officially done with my work.
- Oh, yeah? Nice!

686
00:36:17,973 --> 00:36:20,635
l'm telling you, dude,
things are finally starting to go our way.

687
00:36:22,511 --> 00:36:24,274
Hey, dude, check it out--
Sixteern Carndles.

688
00:36:24,346 --> 00:36:25,904
lsn't that your favorite movie?

689
00:36:25,981 --> 00:36:27,107
Wow, man, that's awesome!

690
00:36:29,017 --> 00:36:31,508
Yo, look who decided
to go see it.

691
00:36:31,586 --> 00:36:32,780
Holy shit.

692
00:36:32,854 --> 00:36:35,288
See! You said you two
had nothing in common,

693
00:36:35,357 --> 00:36:37,450
but you both have the same
lame taste in movies!

694
00:36:37,526 --> 00:36:38,925
Shut up.

695
00:36:38,994 --> 00:36:40,791
Hey, we should ask her if she
wants to come to White Castle.

696
00:36:40,862 --> 00:36:43,490
No. No, no.
Forget about it. Just drive.

697
00:36:43,565 --> 00:36:45,328
Dude, come on.
lt's 1 :00 in the morning.

698
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,061
We're an hour away from home,

699
00:36:47,135 --> 00:36:50,195
and who do we see but your dream girl
standing across the street?

700
00:36:50,272 --> 00:36:53,139
Just pretend you're a nerdy
Asian version of Tom Hanks

701
00:36:53,208 --> 00:36:55,904
and she's a hot Latina Meg Ryan
with bigger tits.

702
00:36:56,945 --> 00:36:58,879
The cars are going.
Can we go? How about that?

703
00:36:58,947 --> 00:37:01,177
- What are you doing?
- Excuse me, Maria!

704
00:37:01,249 --> 00:37:04,047
- What are you doing?
- Maria! Excuse me for a second!

705
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:05,643
Come here!

706
00:37:06,054 --> 00:37:07,715
No! What the hell
are you doing?

707
00:37:07,789 --> 00:37:09,780
Get your hand off the gas!
Shit!

708
00:37:09,858 --> 00:37:11,792
- l'm stuck!
- Stop turning the wheel!

709
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,953
- l am stuck!
- What do you mean you're stuck?

710
00:37:14,029 --> 00:37:15,087
Get unstuck!

711
00:37:26,875 --> 00:37:28,900
- You asshole!
- Wha--wha--?

712
00:37:28,977 --> 00:37:31,571
We could have seriously
injured ourselves, man!

713
00:37:31,646 --> 00:37:33,113
Yo, don't blame me, genius.

714
00:37:33,181 --> 00:37:35,672
l'm not the one who decided
to run us off the frickin' road, all right?

715
00:37:35,751 --> 00:37:37,514
Let's just get
back on the highway, okay?

716
00:37:37,586 --> 00:37:38,917
Fine with me.

717
00:37:46,461 --> 00:37:48,019
lt's not funny.

718
00:37:57,572 --> 00:38:00,507
- Where's my spare tire?
- l don't know.

719
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:03,778
Where the hell
is my spare tire?

720
00:38:03,845 --> 00:38:05,540
Oh, yeah!

721
00:38:05,614 --> 00:38:09,141
Dude, remember that time
we got really stoned

722
00:38:09,217 --> 00:38:12,914
and started throwing shit off
that bridge to see if it would float?

723
00:38:14,356 --> 00:38:16,688
What bridge? l don't remem--
What are you talking about?

724
00:38:16,758 --> 00:38:19,056
Oh, shit, that's right.
That was with Goldstein.

725
00:38:20,896 --> 00:38:22,887
We borrowed your car
that night. My bad.

726
00:38:22,964 --> 00:38:26,297
Your bad? What the hell
are we gonna do now?

727
00:38:29,971 --> 00:38:31,939
- Hey!
- Hey! Excuse me!

728
00:38:32,007 --> 00:38:34,441
- Hello! Over here!
- Excuse me!

729
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:46,949
You boys need some help?

730
00:38:53,862 --> 00:38:56,262
Thanks for helping us out.

731
00:38:59,534 --> 00:39:00,967
No problem at all.

732
00:39:01,036 --> 00:39:05,132
l seen you two stranded
out there alone in the dark,

733
00:39:05,207 --> 00:39:08,438
and l said to myself...

734
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:10,171
''What would Jesus do?''

735
00:39:10,245 --> 00:39:11,906
Goin' down to Georgia

736
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:15,472
Gonna get myself baptized,
gonna get myself baptized

737
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:18,348
ln the bosom of the Lord

738
00:39:22,657 --> 00:39:25,649
Have you boys accepted Jesus
as your Lord and Savior?

739
00:39:25,727 --> 00:39:27,854
- Yes.
- Yeah, he's great. Cool guy.

740
00:39:27,929 --> 00:39:30,523
Praise the Lord
and pass the ammunition!

741
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:34,330
Name's Randy,
but everybody calls me Freakshow.

742
00:39:34,402 --> 00:39:35,994
My name's Kumar.

743
00:39:36,071 --> 00:39:38,005
How are you, Kunie?

744
00:39:39,708 --> 00:39:41,733
- This is Harold.
- Hi, Jerald. How are you?

745
00:39:42,811 --> 00:39:45,177
So where exactly
are we going?

746
00:39:45,247 --> 00:39:48,341
Don't you worry about that none.
We ain't too far from my place.

747
00:39:48,416 --> 00:39:52,113
Once we get there, l'll have
your ride fixed up in a jiffy.

748
00:39:59,561 --> 00:40:01,859
Check out those boils
on his neck.

749
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:03,989
You gotta look.
One of them's actually pulsating.

750
00:40:04,799 --> 00:40:08,860
Shut up. He's right next to me.
He can hear you.

751
00:40:08,937 --> 00:40:10,666
Now there's some sort of puss.

752
00:40:10,739 --> 00:40:12,036
- lt's disgusting!
- Shut up.

753
00:40:12,107 --> 00:40:14,871
Just one little boil.
Just look at it.

754
00:40:23,218 --> 00:40:25,880
See, isn't that the most disgusting
thing you've ever seen?

755
00:40:25,954 --> 00:40:28,115
Do you think just
because you're whispering,

756
00:40:28,189 --> 00:40:31,181
he can't hear
what you're saying?

757
00:40:31,259 --> 00:40:34,160
He's two feet away from us.
He can hear this entire conversation.

758
00:40:34,229 --> 00:40:36,424
He can hear me
talking right now.

759
00:40:36,498 --> 00:40:38,159
Don't worry about it.
He can't hear anything...

760
00:40:38,233 --> 00:40:40,258
not with all that crust in his ear.

761
00:40:49,044 --> 00:40:51,103
l heard everything you said.

762
00:40:59,754 --> 00:41:02,314
lt's gonna take me a while
to fix up your car there,

763
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:06,588
so if you boys like,
you can go on inside,

764
00:41:06,661 --> 00:41:08,959
get yourselves something
to drink, wash up,

765
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:11,555
fuck my wife, watch TV--
anything you want.

766
00:41:11,633 --> 00:41:15,160
Mi casa es su casa.

767
00:41:15,236 --> 00:41:18,672
Just don't do anything
the Good Lord wouldn't do.

768
00:41:19,774 --> 00:41:20,763
Thank you.

769
00:41:22,344 --> 00:41:24,539
We're gonna die.
He's going to kill us.

770
00:41:24,613 --> 00:41:25,978
We're gonna die.

771
00:41:26,047 --> 00:41:29,210
Dude, am l deaf, or did he just say
we get to fuck his wife?

772
00:41:29,284 --> 00:41:31,047
He couldn't have said that.

773
00:41:33,355 --> 00:41:35,289
Who cares?
You've seen Freakshow.

774
00:41:35,357 --> 00:41:37,257
What do you think his wife
is gonna look like?

775
00:41:50,839 --> 00:41:52,602
Oh, hi, boys.

776
00:41:52,674 --> 00:41:55,199
l'm Freakshow's wife Liane.

777
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:57,901
Can l get you some pink lemonade?

778
00:41:57,979 --> 00:42:01,073
Why don't you just go
have a seat in the living room?

779
00:42:01,149 --> 00:42:02,673
l'll be back in a jiffy.

780
00:42:02,751 --> 00:42:04,116
Thanks.

781
00:42:07,656 --> 00:42:10,625
- Hot. Hot!
- Uh-huh.

782
00:42:19,067 --> 00:42:20,762
Jesus Christ.

783
00:42:25,907 --> 00:42:29,434
Okay, it's official.
We've entered the Twilight Zone.

784
00:42:29,511 --> 00:42:32,537
- Dude, Liane is fucking hot.
- She's not ugly.

785
00:42:34,516 --> 00:42:35,949
Here you go, boys.

786
00:42:36,017 --> 00:42:37,211
- Thank you.
- Thanks a lot.

787
00:42:37,285 --> 00:42:40,311
Liane, how are things between you
and Freakshow presently?

788
00:42:40,388 --> 00:42:43,687
Oh! They've never been better.
We love each other so much.

789
00:42:43,758 --> 00:42:48,661
l was just wondering,
how does a guy like Freakshow...

790
00:42:52,734 --> 00:42:55,999
...end up with a girl like you?

791
00:42:56,071 --> 00:43:00,167
Well, we met at choir practice
about four years ago.

792
00:43:00,241 --> 00:43:02,209
Freakshow was really shy
back then, you know,

793
00:43:02,277 --> 00:43:04,336
'cause of all his hideous boils
on his face and neck.

794
00:43:04,412 --> 00:43:05,674
Sure, sure.

795
00:43:05,747 --> 00:43:08,307
But he had
the most amazing voice,

796
00:43:08,383 --> 00:43:10,180
like a baby canary.

797
00:43:11,286 --> 00:43:13,345
The devil is everywhere

798
00:43:13,421 --> 00:43:16,288
Hey, Randy, what,
the devil, huh

799
00:43:16,357 --> 00:43:18,154
The devil is everywhere

800
00:43:18,226 --> 00:43:20,091
Hey, Randy, what

801
00:43:20,161 --> 00:43:23,358
After Easter service one day,
l told him how much l loved his solo

802
00:43:23,431 --> 00:43:25,365
and he finally mustered up
the courage to ask me out.

803
00:43:25,433 --> 00:43:27,526
We've been in love ever since.

804
00:43:27,602 --> 00:43:30,400
So, are you boys gonna
fuck me now or what?

805
00:43:32,841 --> 00:43:35,036
Rock, paper, scissors
to see who goes first. Ready?

806
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:36,941
- Rock, paper--
- Wait a second.

807
00:43:37,011 --> 00:43:38,740
What about Freakshow?

808
00:43:38,813 --> 00:43:42,408
What? You assume we don't
know how to have a good time?

809
00:43:42,484 --> 00:43:44,076
l just...

810
00:43:53,128 --> 00:43:54,925
Never mind.
Rock, paper, scissors.

811
00:43:54,996 --> 00:43:59,023
Sorry, but if you boys want me,
you have to do me at the same time.

812
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:02,092
- Huh?
- Come on, give me the double stuff.

813
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:04,070
l'm not sure
we quite understand, Liane.

814
00:44:04,139 --> 00:44:07,540
l want you both
inside me simultaneously.

815
00:44:07,609 --> 00:44:09,600
- One hole or two?
- Whatever you want.

816
00:44:09,677 --> 00:44:12,237
Sorry. No, thank you.
No, thank you.

817
00:44:12,313 --> 00:44:14,281
Dude, if it's two holes,
it might not be that bad.

818
00:44:14,349 --> 00:44:16,078
- Shotgun anus.
- Forget it!

819
00:44:16,151 --> 00:44:18,051
l don't want our balls
rubbing against each other.

820
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:19,984
- What, are you kidding?
- No way! Forget it.

821
00:44:20,054 --> 00:44:21,783
How about blow jobs?
Can we have blow jobs?

822
00:44:27,128 --> 00:44:28,755
Well, okay.

823
00:44:31,699 --> 00:44:32,825
Come here.

824
00:44:32,901 --> 00:44:35,597
Okay. l'm going up there.

825
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:36,967
l wanna come, too.

826
00:44:37,038 --> 00:44:40,599
- Think you could help me with this?
- You need help?

827
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:44,811
Okay, yeah.
lt's a little sticky there.

828
00:44:44,879 --> 00:44:46,972
- You can do it.
- Okay.

829
00:44:47,048 --> 00:44:48,845
l can do it.
l can do it.

830
00:45:02,997 --> 00:45:04,931
Do you wanna play with them?

831
00:45:04,999 --> 00:45:05,988
Play with them.

832
00:45:07,569 --> 00:45:10,129
- Yeah, let's do that.
- Okay.

833
00:45:10,205 --> 00:45:12,070
Let's do that.

834
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:17,146
Well, boys, l fixed your tire.

835
00:45:20,294 --> 00:45:21,659
Hi, honey.

836
00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:25,167
What in the hell
are you doing with my wife?

837
00:45:26,135 --> 00:45:29,229
You said outside that
we could have sex with her.

838
00:45:29,306 --> 00:45:30,568
Shit! Shit!

839
00:45:30,641 --> 00:45:33,542
- l most certainly did not.
- Yeah, you did.

840
00:45:33,612 --> 00:45:35,011
- l did not!
- You did.

841
00:45:35,081 --> 00:45:37,106
- Oh, no, l didn't!
- You did, you did.

842
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:41,253
- You sure?
- You said it.

843
00:45:45,761 --> 00:45:46,750
My mistake!

844
00:45:46,829 --> 00:45:48,353
Freakshow.

845
00:45:48,431 --> 00:45:51,525
Well, since we're all here...

846
00:45:52,370 --> 00:45:54,361
...how about a foursome?

847
00:45:54,438 --> 00:45:56,372
Who wants the first reach-around?

848
00:46:04,919 --> 00:46:07,387
Okay, let's agree to never talk
about what just happened.

849
00:46:07,455 --> 00:46:08,547
Agreed.

850
00:46:08,624 --> 00:46:11,559
That's a very good idea.

851
00:46:11,627 --> 00:46:13,390
Dude, l have no idea
where we are.

852
00:46:13,463 --> 00:46:14,760
What?

853
00:46:16,334 --> 00:46:17,767
- ls that a hitchhiker?
- What the hell?

854
00:46:17,835 --> 00:46:20,235
- Should we pick him up?
- And get chopped to bits? Are you crazy?

855
00:46:20,306 --> 00:46:22,638
You know what? We're lost. He may
know how to get back on the highway.

856
00:46:22,709 --> 00:46:25,200
Get back on the road.
This is my car.

857
00:46:25,278 --> 00:46:26,939
We are not picking up
a hitchhiker, man.

858
00:46:27,014 --> 00:46:29,744
Hey, guys, thanks
for picking me up.

859
00:46:33,656 --> 00:46:36,318
Excuse me,
are you Neil Patrick Harris?

860
00:46:36,393 --> 00:46:37,382
Yep.

861
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:39,486
- Oh, my God, what are you doing here?
- Holy shit.

862
00:46:39,564 --> 00:46:41,498
Dude, Doogie Howser M.D. was,
like, my favorite show growing up.

863
00:46:41,566 --> 00:46:42,555
You were my idol.

864
00:46:42,634 --> 00:46:44,864
That's great. Could we get going?
l'm bored as shit back here.

865
00:46:45,538 --> 00:46:48,166
- Go, go.
- Let's go. This is a frickin' boring spot.

866
00:46:55,617 --> 00:46:58,313
So l gotta ask you, Neil,

867
00:46:58,388 --> 00:47:00,583
did you ever get it on
with Wanda off the set?

868
00:47:00,658 --> 00:47:03,252
Dude, l humped every piece
of ass ever on that show.

869
00:47:03,328 --> 00:47:05,023
Even the chick
who played the hot nurse?

870
00:47:06,098 --> 00:47:10,001
No. l didn't go
all the way with her.

871
00:47:13,375 --> 00:47:14,535
Neil, you wouldn't happen to know

872
00:47:14,609 --> 00:47:15,940
how to get on the highway
from here, would you?

873
00:47:16,011 --> 00:47:18,138
Dude, l don't even know
where the fuck l am right now.

874
00:47:18,214 --> 00:47:19,476
l was at this party earlier tonight

875
00:47:19,548 --> 00:47:22,278
and some guy hooked me up
with this incredible X.

876
00:47:22,352 --> 00:47:24,946
The next thing l know, l'm being
thrown out of a moving car.

877
00:47:25,023 --> 00:47:28,390
- l've been tripping balls ever since.
- That's crazy, dude.

878
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:29,893
We've been having
a pretty crazy night, too.

879
00:47:29,962 --> 00:47:31,725
We've just been driving around
looking for White Castle,

880
00:47:31,798 --> 00:47:33,163
but we keep getting sidetracked.

881
00:47:33,233 --> 00:47:34,291
Yeah, dude, you fascinate me.

882
00:47:34,368 --> 00:47:36,336
Forget White Castle.
Let's go get some pussy.

883
00:47:36,404 --> 00:47:38,702
- Huh?
- lt's a fuckin' sausage-fest in here.

884
00:47:38,774 --> 00:47:41,174
Let's get us some poontang.
Then we'll go to White Castle.

885
00:47:41,244 --> 00:47:42,302
No, Neil, you don't understand.

886
00:47:42,378 --> 00:47:44,312
We've been craving
these burgers all night.

887
00:47:44,381 --> 00:47:46,713
Yeah, l've been craving
burgers, too--fur burgers.

888
00:47:46,784 --> 00:47:49,844
Come on, dudes, let's pick up
some trim at a strip club.

889
00:47:49,921 --> 00:47:52,355
The Doogie line
always works on strippers.

890
00:47:52,425 --> 00:47:55,189
Lap dance.

891
00:47:55,962 --> 00:47:58,863
There's a gas station.
l'm gonna see if we can get directions.

892
00:47:58,933 --> 00:48:00,901
We don't need...

893
00:48:02,905 --> 00:48:06,535
Hurry up, dudes, hurry up.
l'm losing wood.

894
00:48:10,347 --> 00:48:13,180
Hurry, hurry, hurry,
hurry, hurry, hurry.

895
00:48:13,251 --> 00:48:15,219
- Chill.
- We'll be right back, Neil.

896
00:48:15,288 --> 00:48:16,585
We'll be back.

897
00:48:22,697 --> 00:48:25,825
What's the deal with Neil Patrick Harris?
Why is he so horny?

898
00:48:25,901 --> 00:48:29,029
l don't know, but we can't
let him interfere with our quest.

899
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:33,771
- Oh, God.
- Shit, these punks again.

900
00:48:33,845 --> 00:48:35,472
Late-night Math League
meeting, homos?

901
00:48:35,547 --> 00:48:37,242
Extreme!

902
00:48:40,453 --> 00:48:41,715
Let's go.

903
00:48:51,534 --> 00:48:54,526
No, no.
Pies, pies--no.

904
00:49:00,779 --> 00:49:02,144
Dude, what is that?
ls that a pterodactyl?

905
00:49:02,214 --> 00:49:03,613
l do not know what that is.

906
00:49:03,683 --> 00:49:05,617
That was extreme, dude!

907
00:49:05,685 --> 00:49:08,848
Excuse me, can you tell us how
to get to the highway from here?

908
00:49:08,923 --> 00:49:10,049
Dude, l got this.

909
00:49:21,873 --> 00:49:24,364
Dude, who knew learning Hindi
would actually pay off?

910
00:49:24,443 --> 00:49:26,502
Guy says the highway is, like,
a couple traffic lights from here.

911
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:28,514
We should be in Cherry Hill
in ten minutes.

912
00:49:28,582 --> 00:49:30,709
- Ready? One, two, three!
- No. No.

913
00:49:30,785 --> 00:49:32,878
- No.
- Extreme kayaking!

914
00:49:32,954 --> 00:49:34,421
No!

915
00:49:37,027 --> 00:49:38,324
Extreme!

916
00:49:43,468 --> 00:49:45,834
- No!
- Man, that was so fuckin' extreme!

917
00:49:46,538 --> 00:49:48,199
On a scale of 1 to 10,

918
00:49:48,274 --> 00:49:51,243
one being not so extreme
and ten being extremely extreme,

919
00:49:51,312 --> 00:49:53,280
l give this a 9.5!

920
00:49:54,849 --> 00:49:57,010
- Check it out!
- Extreme cheddar!

921
00:50:02,859 --> 00:50:05,350
- Hey.
- Extreme cashier!

922
00:50:06,764 --> 00:50:07,856
Somebody should do something.

923
00:50:09,568 --> 00:50:10,967
Yeah, you're right.

924
00:50:11,037 --> 00:50:13,665
Hey, asshole!
Why don't you leave that guy alone

925
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:16,004
and go jerk off to some
snowboarding videos or something?

926
00:50:19,381 --> 00:50:21,246
l didn't mean you
should do something about it.

927
00:50:33,065 --> 00:50:34,896
What? You're gonna take that?

928
00:50:34,968 --> 00:50:37,835
What's up with that? Huh?

929
00:50:37,905 --> 00:50:39,634
You're gonna take that?

930
00:50:41,075 --> 00:50:42,099
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

931
00:50:42,177 --> 00:50:43,610
- Shit!
- That's right, bitch!

932
00:50:43,679 --> 00:50:46,113
You just try fuckin' with me
one more time!

933
00:50:46,182 --> 00:50:48,742
Just try it!
Thank you, come again.

934
00:50:51,723 --> 00:50:52,781
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

935
00:50:54,326 --> 00:50:56,317
Kumar, you okay?

936
00:50:56,396 --> 00:50:58,421
Yeah, dude,
l just hate those assholes.

937
00:50:58,499 --> 00:51:00,433
You know what? Fuck it, l'm hungry.
Let's just get outta here.

938
00:51:14,919 --> 00:51:17,888
Did Doogie Howser
just steal my fucking car?

939
00:51:21,394 --> 00:51:24,295
Yes. l think he did.

940
00:51:40,186 --> 00:51:42,916
You! You had to pick up
a hitchhiker! Why?!

941
00:51:42,989 --> 00:51:43,978
Calm down.

942
00:51:44,057 --> 00:51:45,490
Why did you leave
the keys in the car?

943
00:51:45,559 --> 00:51:47,117
Why? Because
it would get stolen.

944
00:51:47,195 --> 00:51:50,096
l figured that Neil Patrick Harris
was a trustworthy guy.

945
00:51:50,165 --> 00:51:51,928
Come on. How was l supposed
to know he'd fuck us over?

946
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,833
This whole freaking night,
this whole night, is your fault!

947
00:51:56,674 --> 00:51:59,507
- Where are you going?
- l'm going inside to call the police.

948
00:51:59,578 --> 00:52:01,637
l don't want
to talk to you anymore.

949
00:52:04,384 --> 00:52:06,545
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

950
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:08,417
There's a pay phone
across the street

951
00:52:08,489 --> 00:52:10,582
if you don't wanna
deal with those assholes.

952
00:52:24,276 --> 00:52:28,008
After we talk to the cops, we're
still going to White Castle, right?

953
00:52:28,081 --> 00:52:30,481
l'm not speaking to you.

954
00:52:30,551 --> 00:52:33,611
When are they fucking going
to develop button technology

955
00:52:33,688 --> 00:52:35,178
that will understand urgency?!

956
00:52:35,257 --> 00:52:38,590
- Dude, this is ridiculous. Just walk across.
- lt'll change in a second.

957
00:52:38,661 --> 00:52:40,322
There's not a car in sight.
Just go ahead.

958
00:52:40,397 --> 00:52:43,594
Fine. You want me to cross?
l will cross.

959
00:52:43,667 --> 00:52:46,067
lf it makes you happy,
l will cross.

960
00:52:47,105 --> 00:52:48,197
l'll do it.

961
00:52:53,708 --> 00:52:55,073
Shit!

962
00:52:55,144 --> 00:52:57,772
- What--
- Sorry.

963
00:53:00,985 --> 00:53:02,545
ls there a problem,
Officer Palumbo?

964
00:53:02,621 --> 00:53:04,816
ls there a problem?
You ever heard of jaywalking?

965
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:05,653
Yes, l have. l'm really sorry.
Won't happen again.

966
00:53:06,726 --> 00:53:08,751
That's great.
l'm writing you up a ticket.

967
00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:10,229
A ticket?
Are you serious?

968
00:53:10,298 --> 00:53:12,266
Who the fuck are you, shitwad?

969
00:53:12,334 --> 00:53:14,928
Let me apologize
for my friend here. l'm very sorry.

970
00:53:15,004 --> 00:53:16,904
l'm really glad you're here.
We've had a rough night.

971
00:53:16,973 --> 00:53:18,736
You know the show
Doogie Howser M.D. ?

972
00:53:18,809 --> 00:53:22,108
Great show.
God, l love that show. ''Doogie.''

973
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:24,648
Neil Patrick Harris
stole my car tonight.

974
00:53:24,717 --> 00:53:26,878
Hey, NPH wouldn't do that,
all right?

975
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:28,284
Give me some l.D.

976
00:53:28,355 --> 00:53:30,687
Excuse me, how can you
give him a ticket for jaywalking?

977
00:53:30,757 --> 00:53:34,250
lt's 2:30 in the morning.
There's not a car around here.

978
00:53:34,329 --> 00:53:35,455
Kumar, shut up.

979
00:53:35,531 --> 00:53:36,793
That's not the kind of tone
you want to use

980
00:53:36,866 --> 00:53:38,356
on a cop who can bust your ass.

981
00:53:38,435 --> 00:53:41,029
- Bust my ass?
- Yeah, Koo-mar.

982
00:53:41,104 --> 00:53:43,629
Bust your ass.

983
00:53:43,708 --> 00:53:46,370
What kind of name
is that anyhow? Koo-mar.

984
00:53:46,445 --> 00:53:49,039
What is that,
like, five O's or two U's?

985
00:53:49,115 --> 00:53:50,742
No, it's actually one U.

986
00:53:50,817 --> 00:53:52,307
Yeah, bullshit.

987
00:53:52,386 --> 00:53:55,823
Whatever happened to good old
American names like Dave or Jim?

988
00:53:55,891 --> 00:53:57,518
- Harold.
- Harold.

989
00:53:57,592 --> 00:53:59,253
- Are you kidd--
- Now that's a great name.

990
00:53:59,328 --> 00:54:00,886
- Let me take care of this.
- You should be proud of that name, son.

991
00:54:00,963 --> 00:54:02,658
As you were, ladies.

992
00:54:03,734 --> 00:54:06,862
- $220?! Are you crazy?!
- Kumar, if you don't stop--

993
00:54:06,938 --> 00:54:09,270
No, l understand exactly
what's going on here.

994
00:54:09,341 --> 00:54:12,139
Excuse me, officer, let me
take a couple of guesses.

995
00:54:12,211 --> 00:54:14,179
- l'm really sorry--
- Get your hands down!

996
00:54:14,247 --> 00:54:16,477
- Okay, alright.
- No sudden moves. Back it up!

997
00:54:16,551 --> 00:54:18,849
You were probably the big asshole
in your high school, right?

998
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,080
Absolutely right.

999
00:54:20,155 --> 00:54:21,713
Used to pick on guys like us
every day, right?

1000
00:54:21,790 --> 00:54:22,848
With pleasure.

1001
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:25,156
Then graduation day came,
and we went to college,

1002
00:54:25,228 --> 00:54:26,889
and you went nowhere,
and you thought,

1003
00:54:26,964 --> 00:54:28,693
''Hey, how can l
still give them shit?

1004
00:54:28,766 --> 00:54:30,393
l know, l'll become a cop.''

1005
00:54:30,468 --> 00:54:33,369
Well, congratu-fuckin'-lations.
Your dream has come true.

1006
00:54:33,439 --> 00:54:35,566
Now, why don't you just take
this quiet little Asian guy

1007
00:54:35,641 --> 00:54:37,768
with the Anglicized name
that treats you so well

1008
00:54:37,844 --> 00:54:39,243
and give him a couple
of other tickets?

1009
00:54:39,313 --> 00:54:41,076
- Better yet, just take him to jail.
- Better idea.

1010
00:54:41,149 --> 00:54:43,117
Why don't you just arrest him?
Does that work out for you okay, Harold?

1011
00:54:43,185 --> 00:54:44,413
- ''Great American name, Harold.''
- Let's go, Harold.

1012
00:54:44,486 --> 00:54:46,420
Thanks to your buddy,
we're going downtow--

1013
00:54:51,862 --> 00:54:53,193
Oh, shit.

1014
00:54:54,266 --> 00:54:58,897
Well, thank you so much for
being understanding about Bradley.

1015
00:54:58,972 --> 00:55:01,566
l promise you
he won't ever do it again.

1016
00:55:01,642 --> 00:55:03,303
l'm sure he won't.

1017
00:55:04,045 --> 00:55:05,774
Right, Brad?

1018
00:55:05,847 --> 00:55:07,747
Yes, sir,
Officer Palumbo, sir.

1019
00:55:07,817 --> 00:55:11,879
- Mommy, can we go home?
- Get in the car, Bradley Thomas.

1020
00:55:11,955 --> 00:55:12,979
Bye, Brad.

1021
00:55:13,056 --> 00:55:15,081
Are you gonna do
something about my car?

1022
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:17,125
First our top story.

1023
00:55:17,196 --> 00:55:20,222
The search for the escaped cheetah
cortirues toright.

1024
00:55:20,299 --> 00:55:23,291
ht was last spotted
ir Rardolph Courty. south of....

1025
00:55:24,438 --> 00:55:27,669
- So what are you in here for?
- For being black.

1026
00:55:28,377 --> 00:55:29,366
Seriously.

1027
00:55:30,012 --> 00:55:32,537
l am serious.
You wanna know what happened?

1028
00:55:33,883 --> 00:55:36,374
l was walking
out of a Barnes & Noble,

1029
00:55:36,453 --> 00:55:37,852
and a cop stops me.

1030
00:55:37,922 --> 00:55:41,289
Evidently a black guy
robbed a store in Newark.

1031
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:44,956
l told him, ''l haven't even been
to Newark in months.''

1032
00:55:45,032 --> 00:55:46,727
So, he starts beating me
with his gun...

1033
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:49,098
- ...telling me to stop resisting arrest.
- Holy shit! What'd you do?

1034
00:55:49,170 --> 00:55:51,434
l kept saying,
''l understand l'm under arrest.

1035
00:55:51,507 --> 00:55:53,600
Now please stop beating me.''

1036
00:55:53,676 --> 00:55:56,042
l don't understand how
you can be so calm about all this.

1037
00:55:56,112 --> 00:56:00,140
Look at me.
l'm fat, black, can't dance,

1038
00:56:00,217 --> 00:56:01,844
and l have two gay fathers.

1039
00:56:02,754 --> 00:56:05,587
People have been
messing with me my whole life.

1040
00:56:05,658 --> 00:56:09,425
l learned a long time ago that
there's no sense getting all riled up

1041
00:56:09,496 --> 00:56:11,896
every time a bunch of idiots
give you a hard time.

1042
00:56:12,634 --> 00:56:16,833
ln the end, the universe tends
to unfold as it should.

1043
00:56:18,307 --> 00:56:20,707
Plus l have a really large penis.
That keeps me happy.

1044
00:56:21,913 --> 00:56:23,005
Hey, hey, listen up, guys!

1045
00:56:23,081 --> 00:56:24,548
Multiple gunshots
fired in Millbrook Park.

1046
00:56:24,615 --> 00:56:26,810
Finally, some action.
l'm goin'!

1047
00:56:26,885 --> 00:56:28,944
- No, l'm goin'!
- Lock and load!

1048
00:56:37,099 --> 00:56:38,088
That was strange.

1049
00:56:41,437 --> 00:56:43,598
What the hell was that?

1050
00:56:43,674 --> 00:56:45,869
Rold. ls that you?

1051
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:48,071
- Kumar?
- Are the cops still here?

1052
00:56:48,146 --> 00:56:49,477
What the hell are you doing?

1053
00:56:49,548 --> 00:56:52,073
l just called and made up some story
about a shooting in Millbrook Park.

1054
00:56:52,151 --> 00:56:54,244
- Jesus Christ, what'd you do that for?
- l'm fucking starving.

1055
00:56:54,321 --> 00:56:57,017
l figured l'd bust you out
and we'd go get some burgers.

1056
00:56:57,091 --> 00:56:59,457
Forget it. l'm not getting
into any more trouble.

1057
00:56:59,528 --> 00:57:01,189
l'm already in here because of you.

1058
00:57:01,263 --> 00:57:02,252
Hey, fuck you!

1059
00:57:02,331 --> 00:57:04,629
What did you want me to do,
stand there and take the hit?

1060
00:57:04,701 --> 00:57:06,225
You know l've never
taken a swing at you, ever.

1061
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:07,565
Well, l never got your car stolen.

1062
00:57:07,638 --> 00:57:08,935
- Fine. l'm leaving.
- Fine.

1063
00:57:12,711 --> 00:57:16,580
- Harold, how do l get out of here?
- How the hell should l know?

1064
00:57:16,650 --> 00:57:18,743
Shit! Oh, God, this isn't good.

1065
00:57:25,694 --> 00:57:27,389
My ass!

1066
00:57:30,935 --> 00:57:33,301
Sure you don't want
to get out of here?

1067
00:57:33,372 --> 00:57:35,306
And become a fugitive?
Are you nuts?

1068
00:57:35,374 --> 00:57:37,706
- The guy has all my information.
- So what?

1069
00:57:37,777 --> 00:57:39,677
We'll just take what he
wrote down about you and leave.

1070
00:57:39,746 --> 00:57:41,179
Unless you want to
stay here all night

1071
00:57:41,248 --> 00:57:43,239
and not be able to
turn in your work tomorrow.

1072
00:57:47,723 --> 00:57:48,917
Fine, hurry up.

1073
00:57:48,991 --> 00:57:51,892
Yes! All right,
we gotta find keys.

1074
00:57:51,962 --> 00:57:54,260
Oh, yes!

1075
00:57:54,332 --> 00:57:56,493
Sweet! l was hoping it would
be one of these big ring of keys.

1076

1078
00:58:09,051 --> 00:58:11,679

1079
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:13,986

1086
00:58:53,575 --> 00:58:56,510
But go crazy or you

1087
00:58:57,847 --> 00:59:00,782
Crazy or you

Let me go crazy.

Let me go crazy.

00:59:15,971 --> 00:59:17,529

1093
00:59:18,073 --> 00:59:19,768
No, no, no.

1094
00:59:20,577 --> 00:59:22,511
No, baby, come on.

1095
00:59:23,747 --> 00:59:26,739
Hey, Kumar. Kumar!
Where are you--

1096
00:59:26,818 --> 00:59:28,945
Kumar!
Still in jail, asshole!

1097
00:59:29,020 --> 00:59:30,317
Come here!

1098
00:59:34,094 --> 00:59:35,118
Kumar! The cops--

1099
00:59:35,195 --> 00:59:37,129
You thought you'd
get away with it, huh?

1100
00:59:37,198 --> 00:59:39,928
l was in bed.
l didn't fire any gun. l swear.

1101
00:59:41,170 --> 00:59:43,468
Hey, Jackson's trying to escape!

1102
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:45,599
What are you talking about?
l'm just sitting here.

1103
00:59:45,675 --> 00:59:46,801
He's trying to break free!
Get him!

1104
00:59:46,877 --> 00:59:49,311
- Aw, shit.
- Don't move!

1105
00:59:51,216 --> 00:59:53,480
Stop resisting!
We need backup now!

1106
00:59:53,553 --> 00:59:55,418
- He's got a gun.
- That's not a gun, that's a book.

1107
00:59:55,488 --> 00:59:57,422
- Secure the book!
- Book is secure.

1108
00:59:57,491 --> 01:00:01,223
You bring this filth in here?
What is this shit?

1109
01:00:01,296 --> 01:00:03,821
Wait, wait. We gotta
do something about this.

1110
01:00:03,899 --> 01:00:06,299
We're gonna teach you
how to read now, brother.

1111
01:00:06,937 --> 01:00:09,337
lf l were you, l'd leave
as soon as possible.

1112
01:00:09,406 --> 01:00:10,964
- Whose hand is that?
- Thanks, man.

1113
01:00:21,422 --> 01:00:24,289
Jesus Christ.
Thanks for getting me out, man.

1114
01:00:24,359 --> 01:00:28,456
No problem. The burgers wouldn't
taste as good if you weren't there.

1115
01:00:28,531 --> 01:00:29,896
Hey, look at this.

1116
01:00:29,966 --> 01:00:33,733
lt's like we went from being
completely poor to being millionaires.

1117
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:37,838
- What was that?
- Probably just a coyote.

1118
01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:39,810
Aren't people supposed to
be scared of coyotes?

1119
01:00:39,879 --> 01:00:41,369
That's just
'cause they sound scary, man.

1120
01:00:41,448 --> 01:00:44,576
ln one-on-one combat, either of us
could take down a coyote, no problem.

1121
01:00:44,652 --> 01:00:45,812
What?

1122
01:00:49,191 --> 01:00:50,920
Now, cheetahs are another story.

1123
01:00:53,630 --> 01:00:55,598
- We're gonna die.
- No, now hold on.

1124
01:00:55,666 --> 01:00:57,133
Cheetahs are used to
eating gazelles and shit.

1125
01:00:57,201 --> 01:00:58,395
They're not known
for eating humans.

1126
01:01:00,005 --> 01:01:02,371
That is a corpse.
We're gonna die.

1127
01:01:02,442 --> 01:01:03,773
Shit!
That's not a good sign.

1128
01:01:03,843 --> 01:01:06,937
Maybe if we just stay really,
really still, he'll just go away.

1129
01:01:07,014 --> 01:01:08,174
Okay.

1130
01:01:09,117 --> 01:01:10,948
Just stay really still.
Don't move, okay?

1131
01:01:11,019 --> 01:01:13,112
Just stay right there.
Very good. Good job.

1132
01:01:13,189 --> 01:01:14,884
This isn't working.

1133
01:01:18,930 --> 01:01:21,956
He's mauling me!
He's mauling me!

1134
01:01:25,972 --> 01:01:28,805
Dude, l told you not
to bring the beef jerky.

1135
01:01:39,289 --> 01:01:40,881
He likes me.

1136
01:01:43,495 --> 01:01:45,725
Hey, Rold, l have an idea.

1137
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:51,037
- You gotta be kidding me, man.
- Uh-uh.

1138
01:01:56,078 --> 01:01:58,171
This is either a really smart move

1139
01:01:58,247 --> 01:02:00,943
or by far the stupidest thing
that we have ever tried.

1140
01:02:01,017 --> 01:02:03,247
Well, we're about to find out.

1141
01:02:04,355 --> 01:02:05,344
Mush!

1142
01:02:07,092 --> 01:02:08,719
l told you this was--

1143
01:02:18,039 --> 01:02:19,028
Oy vey!

1144
01:02:21,544 --> 01:02:25,845
Dude, am l really high,
or is this actually working?

1145
01:02:25,916 --> 01:02:28,407
- Both!
- This is awesome!

1146
01:02:28,486 --> 01:02:30,579
We're gonna be
at White Castle in no time!

1147
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:32,689
That was close, huh, Roldy?

1148
01:02:37,731 --> 01:02:41,132
Harold.
l need you, Harold.

1149
01:02:49,379 --> 01:02:51,574
l need you, Harold.

1150
01:02:52,116 --> 01:02:53,708
Come here.

1151
01:02:53,786 --> 01:02:56,152
- Come here, Harold.
- Maria.

1152
01:02:56,222 --> 01:02:58,690
- Come, Harold.
- l'm coming, baby!

1153
01:02:59,593 --> 01:03:02,118
l want you to hold me.
Papi. l need you.

1154
01:03:02,196 --> 01:03:05,029
Baby, l'm a-comin'!

1155
01:03:05,534 --> 01:03:06,523
Not so fast.

1156
01:03:06,602 --> 01:03:08,263
w atch out, watch out

1157
01:03:09,973 --> 01:03:11,338
Come on!

1158
01:03:14,112 --> 01:03:19,415
Bullets--my only weakness.
How did you know?

1159
01:03:19,485 --> 01:03:20,474
Maria

1160
01:03:20,553 --> 01:03:22,043
Harold.

1161
01:03:22,122 --> 01:03:23,453
Maria.

1162
01:03:23,523 --> 01:03:26,287
Maria

1163
01:03:32,235 --> 01:03:34,032
Maria. Maria

1164
01:03:39,778 --> 01:03:41,075
w atch out, watch out

1165
01:03:43,650 --> 01:03:45,584
w atch out, watch out

1166
01:03:48,823 --> 01:03:51,792
What the hell
are you doing? God!

1167
01:03:51,861 --> 01:03:53,726
You've been out cold
for the past half-hour.

1168
01:03:53,796 --> 01:03:55,991
l figured maybe if l did
some gay shit you'd wake up.

1169
01:03:56,066 --> 01:03:58,330
lf we did some gay shit?
Where are we?

1170
01:03:58,403 --> 01:04:01,304
Didn't we come here on a cheetah?
Where's the cheetah?

1171
01:04:01,372 --> 01:04:03,602
lt ran away. Listen, forget
about the cheetah, okay?

1172
01:04:03,676 --> 01:04:05,906
l have some bad news
and some worse news.

1173
01:04:05,979 --> 01:04:07,810
Give me the worse news first.

1174
01:04:07,881 --> 01:04:09,314
l looked at some
of the road signs up there,

1175
01:04:09,383 --> 01:04:11,613
and it looks like the cheetah
took us in the wrong direction.

1176
01:04:11,686 --> 01:04:13,813
- Shit!
- Yeah.

1177
01:04:13,989 --> 01:04:15,513
- Shit!
- Yeah.

1178
01:04:16,592 --> 01:04:18,184
All right, what's the bad news?

1179
01:04:18,261 --> 01:04:20,161
Your laptop's completely destroyed.

1180
01:04:20,230 --> 01:04:21,629
What?

1181
01:04:21,699 --> 01:04:25,032
Why didn't--
Why didn't you tell me--

1182
01:04:25,103 --> 01:04:27,833
How is that not
the worse news?

1183
01:04:27,907 --> 01:04:29,875
The laptop situation
really only affects you,

1184
01:04:29,943 --> 01:04:33,880
whereas the White Castle
situation affects both of us equally.

1185
01:04:36,618 --> 01:04:38,643
Oh, no! Oh, no!

1186
01:04:38,721 --> 01:04:41,519
All my work was saved
on this computer.

1187
01:04:41,591 --> 01:04:43,559
Now l gotta go back
to the office and redo it.

1188
01:04:43,627 --> 01:04:44,651
Exactly.
First we'll go to White Castle--

1189
01:04:44,729 --> 01:04:46,754
Forget about White Castle.
There is no time.

1190
01:04:47,799 --> 01:04:48,959
Car.

1191
01:04:55,209 --> 01:04:57,109
Hello. Over here!

1192
01:04:59,849 --> 01:05:01,339
Shit.

1193
01:05:23,278 --> 01:05:24,745
Whoa.

1194
01:05:26,382 --> 01:05:27,474
Yeah. Um...

1195
01:05:28,685 --> 01:05:30,983
All right,
we'll get a pay phone,

1196
01:05:31,056 --> 01:05:33,354
get a cab back
to your office, all right?

1197
01:05:34,593 --> 01:05:36,220
Come on. You all right?

1198
01:05:46,041 --> 01:05:48,066
- Hey, check this out!
- Yeah, nice!

1199
01:05:50,781 --> 01:05:52,214
Hey, Apu!

1200
01:05:52,283 --> 01:05:54,751
Jesus. These guys
are frickin' everywhere.

1201
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:57,687
Who's looking after
the Kwik-E-Mart while you're gone?

1202
01:05:57,757 --> 01:06:00,055
You two going
to share a curry Slurpee?

1203
01:06:00,126 --> 01:06:01,616
Fucking assholes.

1204
01:06:02,296 --> 01:06:04,560
Dude, check it out.
lt's Rosenberg and Goldstein.

1205
01:06:09,605 --> 01:06:10,833
l want that.

1206
01:06:10,906 --> 01:06:12,771
What, a Hot Dog Heaven
super chili cheese dog?

1207
01:06:12,843 --> 01:06:15,607
No. l want that feeling.

1208
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:18,046
The feeling that comes over a man

1209
01:06:18,117 --> 01:06:20,210
when he gets
exactly what he desires.

1210
01:06:20,285 --> 01:06:22,219
l need that feeling.

1211
01:06:22,288 --> 01:06:23,846
Are you saying
what l think you're saying?

1212
01:06:23,923 --> 01:06:26,187
- We gotta go to White Castle.
- Yes, yes!

1213
01:06:26,260 --> 01:06:27,887
l knew you had it in you, dude.

1214
01:06:29,030 --> 01:06:30,429
Yo, is that Cindy Kim?

1215
01:06:34,203 --> 01:06:37,536
Oh, dude, you should've boned her
when you had the chance, man.

1216
01:06:37,608 --> 01:06:39,439
Check it out.

1217
01:06:43,315 --> 01:06:44,976
Why don't you guys
just leave us alone?

1218
01:06:45,050 --> 01:06:46,881
What are you gonna
do about it, Mr. Miyagi?

1219
01:06:50,158 --> 01:06:51,591
That's extreme, man!

1220
01:06:52,427 --> 01:06:54,520
There's ro serse
gettirg all riled up

1221
01:06:54,596 --> 01:06:57,360
every time a burch of idiots
give you a hard time.

1222
01:06:57,433 --> 01:07:01,234
The uriverse terds
to urfold as it should.

1223
01:07:02,807 --> 01:07:03,796
Nothing.

1224
01:07:05,711 --> 01:07:07,906
- Fucking extreme!
- l'm so sick of their bullshit.

1225
01:07:09,516 --> 01:07:13,078
Don't worry. The universe
tends to unfold as it should.

1226
01:07:13,154 --> 01:07:15,850
What is that,
some fortune cookie?

1227
01:07:17,426 --> 01:07:21,124
Hey, l got a plan.
Follow my lead, okay?

1228
01:07:21,198 --> 01:07:22,927
- Your lead?
- Yeah.

1229
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,433
Okay.

1230
01:07:24,502 --> 01:07:27,630

1268
01:09:32,134 --> 01:09:34,329
- Oh, shit.

1269
01:09:34,403 --> 01:09:37,065
Fudge, dude.
Are you kidding me?

1270
01:09:37,741 --> 01:09:40,938
- What the hell are you doing?
- l'm not going back to jail, man.

1271
01:09:41,011 --> 01:09:43,878
We've come too far.
Now buckle up. Buckle up!

1272
01:09:45,617 --> 01:09:47,812
We got a chase on our hands.

1273
01:09:49,289 --> 01:09:51,553
- Ready?
- Yeah. For what?

1274
01:09:51,625 --> 01:09:52,887

stomach or else l'd puke right now.

1278
01:10:16,290 --> 01:10:17,621
We're gonna make it.

1279
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:20,494
Everything's gonna be all ri--

1280
01:10:22,598 --> 01:10:24,463
Oh, my God!

1281
01:10:25,936 --> 01:10:27,301
Oh, shit. Holy shit.

1282
01:10:27,372 --> 01:10:29,897
- Put her in reverse. Hurry!
- Shit!

1283
01:10:29,974 --> 01:10:31,839
Let's go out the back.
l'll go first.

1284
01:10:31,911 --> 01:10:34,744
- Don't shake the car!
- Well, hurry up!

1285
01:10:42,357 --> 01:10:43,881
Hey, Roldy, check it out.

1286
01:10:56,476 --> 01:10:58,637
Shit, shit!
We're trapped, man!

1287
01:11:02,283 --> 01:11:04,979
Whoa. Not necessarily.

1288
01:11:05,955 --> 01:11:07,547
No.

1289
01:11:07,624 --> 01:11:09,990
No, not a chance.
l'd rather turn myself in than die.

1290
01:11:10,060 --> 01:11:11,425
No, dude, l know
exactly how to do that.

1291
01:11:11,496 --> 01:11:13,521
l used to do it with my dad
all the time when l was a kid.

1292
01:11:13,598 --> 01:11:16,465
Forget it! l'm not risking my life
over a bunch of hamburgers, man.

1293
01:11:16,535 --> 01:11:18,799
So you think this is
just about the burgers, huh?

1294
01:11:19,706 --> 01:11:23,199
Let me tell you,
it's about far more than that.

1295
01:11:25,046 --> 01:11:27,014
Our parents came to this country,

1296
01:11:27,082 --> 01:11:31,110
escaping persecution,
poverty, and hunger.

1297
01:11:31,955 --> 01:11:33,820
Hunger, Harold.

1298
01:11:33,891 --> 01:11:36,792
They were very, very hungry.

1299
01:11:37,896 --> 01:11:40,592
They wanted to live in a land
that treated them as equals,

1300
01:11:40,666 --> 01:11:42,725
a land filled with hamburger stands.

1301
01:11:42,802 --> 01:11:44,827
And not just
one type of hamburger, okay?

1302
01:11:44,905 --> 01:11:48,501
Hundreds of types with different
sizes, toppings, and condiments.

1303
01:11:50,479 --> 01:11:52,447
That land was America.

1304
01:11:53,082 --> 01:11:56,381
America, Harold! America!

1305
01:11:57,555 --> 01:12:01,219
Now, this is about achieving
what our parents set out for.

1306
01:12:01,293 --> 01:12:04,456
This is about the pursuit
of happiness.

1307
01:12:04,530 --> 01:12:08,467
This night...
is about the American dream.

1308
01:12:15,879 --> 01:12:17,972
Dude, we can stay here,
get arrested,

1309
01:12:18,048 --> 01:12:21,017
and end our hopes of ever
going to White Castle.

1310
01:12:21,085 --> 01:12:24,920
Or we can take that hang glider
and make our leap towards freedom.

1311
01:12:24,990 --> 01:12:27,322
l leave the decision up to you.

1312
01:12:30,130 --> 01:12:31,927
l hate you, Kumar.

1313
01:12:33,435 --> 01:12:35,130
Tilt forward.

1314
01:12:35,203 --> 01:12:36,192
- Roldy.
- What?

1315
01:12:36,272 --> 01:12:38,035
- Don't worry. Everything's gonna be fine.
- All right.

1316
01:12:41,778 --> 01:12:43,405
- Good job, Rold. Keep running.
- Thank you.

1317
01:12:43,481 --> 01:12:46,609
Hey, Roldy, there's something
l forgot to tell you.

1318
01:12:46,685 --> 01:12:48,744
- l've never hang-glided before.
- What?!

1319
01:12:48,821 --> 01:12:50,049
Jump!

1320
01:12:58,500 --> 01:12:59,489
Oh, my God!

1321
01:12:59,568 --> 01:13:01,433
- Dude, it's working!
- Oh, my God!

1322
01:13:01,504 --> 01:13:03,472
Yeah!

1323
01:13:04,108 --> 01:13:05,166
Good news.

1324
01:13:05,242 --> 01:13:07,574
l just found enough dope in the car

1325
01:13:07,646 --> 01:13:11,047
to put these skateboard punks
in jail for the next couple of years.

1326
01:13:13,386 --> 01:13:16,823
- Dude, we're so high right now.
- We're not low.

1327
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,960
All right, l'm bringing her in.
Right, left, left.

1328
01:13:28,039 --> 01:13:29,472
Perfect!

1329
01:13:29,540 --> 01:13:31,735
- Shit!
- Shit!

1330
01:13:43,525 --> 01:13:45,083
God!

1331
01:13:45,161 --> 01:13:46,526
l'm gonna kill you!

1332
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:49,464
Look!

1333
01:13:59,913 --> 01:14:01,346
We made it, dude.

1334
01:14:19,338 --> 01:14:21,272
Looks like you guys
had some night, huh?

1335
01:14:21,340 --> 01:14:24,605
l want 30 Slyders, 5 French fries,
and 4 large Cherry Cokes.

1336
01:14:24,678 --> 01:14:28,615
l want the same, except
make mine Diet Cokes, Chuck.

1337
01:14:28,684 --> 01:14:32,587
Wow. Well, that comes
to $46.75.

1338
01:14:34,824 --> 01:14:37,816
- Dude, where's my money?
- You don't have money?

1339
01:14:37,895 --> 01:14:39,192
- Dude, are you kidding me?
- No.

1340
01:14:39,264 --> 01:14:41,289
l gave mine
to that asshole at Princeton.

1341
01:14:41,366 --> 01:14:44,494
Fuck! Fuck that hippie fuck!
No! Dude, this isn't happening!

1342
01:14:44,570 --> 01:14:46,231
We didn't make it here,
and now we're broke!

1343
01:14:46,306 --> 01:14:47,568
No, no, no, no!

1344
01:14:47,641 --> 01:14:50,872
Guys, let me pay for it.
lt's the least l can do.

1345
01:14:50,945 --> 01:14:52,310
The hell are you doing here?

1346
01:14:52,381 --> 01:14:54,611
You guys kept talking about
White Castle last night so much,

1347
01:14:54,683 --> 01:14:55,980
it made me start to crave it, too.

1348
01:14:56,052 --> 01:14:58,418
- Dude, where's my car?
- Where's his car, dude?

1349
01:14:58,488 --> 01:15:01,981
Yeah, sorry about that.
l told you last night l was tripping balls.

1350
01:15:02,059 --> 01:15:03,583
l don't know what came over me.

1351
01:15:03,662 --> 01:15:06,062
Your car's in the parking lot.
Here are your keys.

1352
01:15:06,132 --> 01:15:08,600
Do you realize what the hell we had to
go through after you took the car?

1353
01:15:08,668 --> 01:15:11,466
Yeah. lt was a dick move
on my part.

1354
01:15:11,539 --> 01:15:15,101
That's why l'm paying
for your meal. Prick.

1355
01:15:15,177 --> 01:15:16,576
Thanks, l guess.

1356
01:15:16,646 --> 01:15:21,710
Here's 50 bucks for the burgers
and 200 for the car.

1357
01:15:22,886 --> 01:15:24,183
What happened to my car?

1358
01:15:24,255 --> 01:15:27,452
l made some love stains
in the back seat.

1359
01:15:27,526 --> 01:15:29,255
You'll see.

1360
01:15:31,965 --> 01:15:34,092
Anyway, nice meeting you guys.
l'll catch you later.

1361
01:15:34,635 --> 01:15:35,897
Where are you going?

1362
01:15:37,339 --> 01:15:39,068
Wherever God takes me.

1363
01:15:56,697 --> 01:15:58,562
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

1364
01:15:58,633 --> 01:15:59,657
Let's do this together.

1365
01:16:36,916 --> 01:16:38,508
Damn, that hit the spot.

1366
01:16:38,585 --> 01:16:41,554
- That was the best meal of my life.
- Mine, too.

1367
01:16:41,622 --> 01:16:43,180
You know what, dude?

1368
01:16:43,257 --> 01:16:45,555
l think l may actually go
to my interview today.

1369
01:16:45,627 --> 01:16:46,719
Are you serious?

1370
01:16:46,795 --> 01:16:48,285
You know, my whole life
l've just been scared

1371
01:16:48,364 --> 01:16:50,491
of being one of those nerdy
lndian guys turned doctor,

1372
01:16:50,566 --> 01:16:52,124
but tonight got me thinking.

1373
01:16:52,202 --> 01:16:54,432
There are far worse things
in this world than being tapped

1374
01:16:54,505 --> 01:16:56,666
for having a natural
ability in medicine.

1375
01:16:56,741 --> 01:16:59,369
Chick magret. chick magret

1376
01:16:59,445 --> 01:17:02,471
Plus, how cool was that,
saving that dude's life last night?

1377
01:17:02,549 --> 01:17:06,452
lt was somewhere between that,
getting yelled at by my dad,

1378
01:17:06,521 --> 01:17:07,510
and seeing Neil Patrick Harris

1379
01:17:07,588 --> 01:17:09,055
that l realized that l've
always wanted to be a doctor

1380
01:17:09,124 --> 01:17:11,149
but l've just been too scared
to admit it to myself.

1381
01:17:11,226 --> 01:17:13,524
- Billy, you paying for this?
- Yeah, l'll be there--

1382
01:17:13,596 --> 01:17:15,154
Good, 'cause if he wasn't,
you would.

1383
01:17:15,231 --> 01:17:18,064
Are you listening to me, Roldy?
l'm having a major epiphany here.

1384
01:17:18,135 --> 01:17:19,796
l'll be right back.

1385
01:17:19,871 --> 01:17:21,600
You're unlike any other woman
l've ever met.

1386
01:17:21,673 --> 01:17:24,164
What the fuck is going on here?

1387
01:17:25,044 --> 01:17:28,013
Harold?
What happened to you, man?

1388
01:17:28,082 --> 01:17:30,243
Never mind me.
What the fuck are you doing here?

1389
01:17:30,318 --> 01:17:32,479
l thought you and J.D.
were busy all night with clients.

1390
01:17:32,555 --> 01:17:33,920
lsn't that why
l had to do your work?

1391
01:17:33,990 --> 01:17:36,220
- Henry, what the hell's going on?
- Back off, cock boy.

1392
01:17:36,293 --> 01:17:38,090
What l said to him
goes double for you.

1393
01:17:38,161 --> 01:17:40,061
- Did you just call me cock boy?
- Yeah, you know l did.

1394
01:17:40,131 --> 01:17:41,120
You're just stalling

1395
01:17:41,199 --> 01:17:43,133
because you're not quick
enough to think of a comeback.

1396
01:17:43,202 --> 01:17:45,136
You think l'm not quick enough.
Guy thinks l'm not quick enough.

1397
01:17:45,204 --> 01:17:47,968
Well, l've got news for you.
l am quick enough...

1398
01:17:51,379 --> 01:17:52,744
...cock boy!

1399
01:17:55,150 --> 01:17:56,708
Listen, Harold, l'm really sorry.

1400
01:17:56,786 --> 01:17:59,152
Don't bother with him. We'll take it up
with Berenson tomorrow.

1401
01:17:59,222 --> 01:18:00,985
What are you
gonna tell Berenson?

1402
01:18:01,058 --> 01:18:03,117
That l'm your workhorse?

1403
01:18:03,194 --> 01:18:05,924
That you guys think
you can party all weekend,

1404
01:18:05,997 --> 01:18:08,056
leave the work to
the quiet Asian guy in the office?

1405
01:18:08,134 --> 01:18:11,365
- No, you don't understand.
- No, you don't understand.

1406
01:18:11,438 --> 01:18:14,771
l'm not doing
your work for you anymore.

1407
01:18:14,842 --> 01:18:17,037
And if either one
of you douche bags

1408
01:18:17,112 --> 01:18:19,137
ever tries to pull
this shit again,

1409
01:18:19,214 --> 01:18:20,647
l'll go to Berenson myself.

1410
01:18:20,717 --> 01:18:22,685
l'll tell him what's really going on.

1411
01:18:22,752 --> 01:18:24,413
And l'll tell the whole office

1412
01:18:24,488 --> 01:18:27,947
how you both caught gonorrhea
from that prostitute in Atlantic City.

1413
01:18:29,227 --> 01:18:31,889
lf you'll excuse me, boys,
l gotta get going. Kumar.

1414
01:18:33,433 --> 01:18:35,663
See you boys
at the office on Monday.

1415
01:18:35,736 --> 01:18:37,067
Excuse me.

1416
01:18:43,947 --> 01:18:46,916
Dude, that was awesome!
Where the hell did that come from?

1417
01:18:46,983 --> 01:18:47,972
l don't know.

1418
01:18:48,052 --> 01:18:51,078
Eating those delicious burgers
made me feel like a new man.

1419
01:18:51,156 --> 01:18:52,180
You know what?

1420
01:18:52,257 --> 01:18:54,054
Now l'm actually looking forward
to going to work this week.

1421
01:18:54,126 --> 01:18:57,585
No shit. You know,
you might be worthwhile after all.

1422
01:18:57,665 --> 01:18:59,132
l'm not worthless.

1423
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:02,567
Hey, so those dudes
really have gonorrhea?

1424
01:19:02,637 --> 01:19:03,899
Beats me.

1425
01:19:05,908 --> 01:19:07,239
Hey.

1426
01:19:08,145 --> 01:19:10,204
- Let's get going.
- What's the rush, dude?

1427
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:11,941
l don't have my interview
for a couple of hours.

1428
01:19:12,016 --> 01:19:14,280
l got some unfinished business
to take care of.

1429
01:19:14,352 --> 01:19:16,149
l thought those guys
were gonna do the work.

1430
01:19:16,222 --> 01:19:18,656
No, unfinished business.

1431
01:19:18,725 --> 01:19:20,920
- Maria.
- Still not following you.

1432
01:19:20,994 --> 01:19:21,983
Get in!

1433
01:19:28,638 --> 01:19:30,071
So you don't even have a plan.

1434
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:33,268
Dude, l got love
on my side, man.

1435
01:19:33,344 --> 01:19:34,504
Trust me.

1436
01:19:34,578 --> 01:19:38,538
When l see Maria, l'm gonna
know exactly what to say.

1437
01:19:43,590 --> 01:19:45,023
- Hey.
- Hey.

1438
01:19:45,092 --> 01:19:47,959
lt looks like you guys
have had some night.

1439
01:19:51,934 --> 01:19:55,564
Shit. You know what?
l left my lighter in your car.

1440
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:57,505
Do me a favor and run down
and get it for me, please?

1441
01:19:57,575 --> 01:19:59,236
l gotta urinate.

1442
01:20:19,804 --> 01:20:22,204
You sure got a lot of baggage.

1443
01:20:33,956 --> 01:20:35,389
Maria, wait.

1444
01:20:35,457 --> 01:20:37,584
l know this is gonna seem
completely out of the blue,

1445
01:20:37,660 --> 01:20:40,720
and l know you don't know me
very well--or, um, at all.

1446
01:20:40,798 --> 01:20:42,663
But let me tell you
the best part of my day is.

1447
01:20:42,733 --> 01:20:45,224
l come home from work
and l walk through this lobby,

1448
01:20:45,303 --> 01:20:47,362
and on days that l'm lucky enough,

1449
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:50,705
l spend ten seconds
in this elevator with you.

1450
01:20:50,777 --> 01:20:52,870
l had the craziest night
of my life tonight,

1451
01:20:52,946 --> 01:20:56,109
and l guess l learned that
if you want something or someone,

1452
01:20:56,184 --> 01:20:57,412
you have to go for it.

1453
01:20:59,588 --> 01:21:01,988
And if Liane can
marry a guy like Freakshow

1454
01:21:02,058 --> 01:21:04,788
and l can hang-glide
and l can ride a cheetah,

1455
01:21:04,862 --> 01:21:06,420
then l guess...

1456
01:21:07,432 --> 01:21:08,421
Oh, fuck it.

1457
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:12,494
Girl, l'm spendin' my dimes

1458
01:21:12,572 --> 01:21:14,904
Give me a minute.
This is crazy.

1459
01:21:14,975 --> 01:21:17,034
- That was...l'm sorry.
- l don't even know you.

1460
01:21:17,111 --> 01:21:19,602
l had White Castle,
so l'm a little dizzy.

1461
01:21:19,681 --> 01:21:22,309
- We don't ever speak.
- We don't talk, so that was inappropriate.

1462
01:21:22,385 --> 01:21:23,647
Oh, fuck it.

1463
01:21:23,719 --> 01:21:26,517
h warra get rext to you

1464
01:21:29,961 --> 01:21:34,296
h warra get rext to you

1465
01:21:37,304 --> 01:21:38,293
Okay.

1466
01:21:40,041 --> 01:21:42,009
Now you just have to work
on your timing.

1467
01:21:42,077 --> 01:21:44,011
- Where are you going?
- Amsterdam.

1468
01:21:44,079 --> 01:21:47,242
l'll be back in ten days.
But l'll see you when l get back?

1469
01:21:47,317 --> 01:21:49,512
Yeah, let's do that.

1470
01:21:56,162 --> 01:21:57,652
Bye, Harold.

1471
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:02,065
Bye. Bye.
l'll see you later.

1472
01:22:03,404 --> 01:22:05,338
- She touch your penis?
- What?

1473
01:22:05,407 --> 01:22:07,034
What happened?

1474
01:22:07,109 --> 01:22:11,547
Nothing much, really.
Just a little kiss action.

1475
01:22:11,614 --> 01:22:13,241
Nice. Nice!

1476
01:22:13,317 --> 01:22:15,877
Yeah. She's going to Amsterdam.
She'll be back in ten days.

1477
01:22:15,954 --> 01:22:17,785
We gotta go.

1478
01:22:17,856 --> 01:22:19,414
- Where?
- Amsterdam, man.

1479
01:22:19,492 --> 01:22:20,891
- We gotta get our bags packed...
- Amsterdam?

1480
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:22,985
...and frickin' take the next flight out.

1481
01:22:23,063 --> 01:22:25,156
Are you freaking out of your mind?
What about your interview?

1482
01:22:25,232 --> 01:22:27,223
Dude, whatever.
l'll tell my dad to reschedule it.

1483
01:22:27,302 --> 01:22:30,135
He won't have a problem as long as
l take it seriously for a change.

1484
01:22:30,206 --> 01:22:33,073
We gotta freakin' go to Europe
and find Maria.

1485
01:22:33,143 --> 01:22:35,202
Dude, she's coming back
in ten days.

1486
01:22:35,278 --> 01:22:36,939
lt's not like l'm never
gonna see her again.

1487
01:22:37,014 --> 01:22:38,242
Listen, for a hot chick,

1488
01:22:38,316 --> 01:22:40,284
ten days in Europe
can be the kiss of death, okay?

1489
01:22:40,352 --> 01:22:43,446
She's gonna have all these suave,
sophisticated guys all over her.

1490
01:22:43,523 --> 01:22:45,491
When she gets back,
she may not be available.

1491
01:22:45,558 --> 01:22:48,026
Forget it. l'll see her
when she comes back.

1492
01:22:48,095 --> 01:22:49,289
Hey, Roldy.

1493
01:22:50,832 --> 01:22:53,892
You do realize what's legal
in Amsterdam, don't you?

1494
01:22:56,473 --> 01:22:57,667
Oh, yeah.

1495
01:23:04,817 --> 01:23:07,581
ln today's headlines,
Rutgers professor Tarik Jackson

1496
01:23:07,654 --> 01:23:10,487
and attorney Nathaniel Banks are
suing the state of New Jersey

1497
01:23:10,558 --> 01:23:13,083
for racial discrimination
and police brutality.

1498
01:23:13,162 --> 01:23:15,596
My family and l are outraged

1499
01:23:15,664 --> 01:23:18,098
and will settle for
nothing less than justice.

1500
01:23:18,168 --> 01:23:22,105
l still trust and love
all white people, all of them.

1501
01:23:22,907 --> 01:23:24,932
And Asians.
And Asians.

1502
01:23:25,010 --> 01:23:26,739
And a few Mexicans as well.

1503
01:23:26,813 --> 01:23:29,281
Several of the officers
suspected of brutality

1504
01:23:29,348 --> 01:23:31,646
were taken into custody
earlier this morning.

1505
01:23:31,718 --> 01:23:33,811
Run away, you mother...

1506
01:23:33,888 --> 01:23:37,723
No black mother...gonna get away
with this, so...all y'all.

1507
01:23:37,793 --> 01:23:39,385
You can suck my...

1508
01:23:39,462 --> 01:23:41,054
Police in Cherry Hill, New Jersey,

1509
01:23:41,131 --> 01:23:43,122
have just arrested
a gang of hooligans

1510
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:46,067
who are suspected of terrorizing
numerous strip malls

1511
01:23:46,137 --> 01:23:47,297
and convenience stores.

1512
01:23:47,372 --> 01:23:49,738
Officer Thurmond Brucks
found their abandoned car,

1513
01:23:49,808 --> 01:23:52,641
which contained a large bag
of marijuana.

1514
01:23:52,712 --> 01:23:55,010
And in other news,
the Muckleburg Police Department

1515
01:23:55,082 --> 01:23:56,879
are still looking for a fugitive

1516
01:23:56,951 --> 01:23:58,851
who escaped
from the police station last night

1517
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:01,616
with a companion
believed to be his accomplice.

1518
01:24:01,691 --> 01:24:03,886
Police have released
sketches of the two fugitives

1519
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:07,054
which they believe
to be extremely accurate.

1520
01:24:10,936 --> 01:24:12,130
Nice!
