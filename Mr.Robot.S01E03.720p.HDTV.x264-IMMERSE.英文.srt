24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,380
I will be the youngest executive this company has ever seen.

25
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:04,510
All right, you know, I'll take it,

26
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:05,400
if you leave us alone.

27
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:05,920
- Thank you. - All right.

28
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:06,960
Check track two out.

29
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,900
- Track two. - All right, man.

30
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:13,140
Why didn't you tell me about the dat file?

31
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:14,880
Worked at Evil Corp his whole life.

32
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,350
And out of the blue, he got fired.

33
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,520
No one knew why.

34
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,650
He had leukemia.

35
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:20,450
Made me swear to never tell anyone,

36
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:22,980
Finally, I got so worried told my mom.

37
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,690
When he found out, he got pissed.

38
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:25,930
You ever think you deserved it?

39
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:27,290
I was eight years ol--

40
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:31,350
You didn't commit to the sacred pact you'd formed.

41
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:48,520
My approach within our business units

42
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,680
is to first invest in new technologies

43
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,980
and develop prototypes

44
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,350
in order to understand the technology potential,

45
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:56,440
because despite the recent success

46
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,520
of our cyber security team,

47
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,800
our company currently still has

48
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,610
72 potential hacker vulnerabilities

49
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:05,560
in our primary and secon-- 

50
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,930
oh, wait. It's 73, you stupid piece of shit.

51
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:09,980
Again.

52
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:12,250
Our company currently still has

53
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:15,310
73 potential hacker vulnerabilities

54
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:17,900
in our primary and secondary data centers.

55
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,030
Now is not the time to be encumbered

56
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:22,550
by the company's tragic and shameful loss

57
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:24,020
of our chief te--

58
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:26,360
Too formal, God damn it.

59
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,380
Warm it up. Don't be a cold robot.

60
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,170
Again.

61
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,550
Now is not the time to be encumbered

62
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,050
by the company's tragic and shameful loss

63
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:36,120
of our chief technology officer.

64
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,380
We have to be swift in naming the replacement CTO,

65
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,050
and, sir, I would like to suggest it be me.

66
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:49,400
For the sake of our company,

67
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:51,890
that we make our decision today,

68
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,000
my promotion--

69
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:01,450
My internal promotion shows not only our confidence as a company,

70
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:04,290
but strength in our boldness to the public.

71
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,500
Thank you for your time.

72
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,620
You will be the next CTO of this company.

73
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,170
You will be the next CTO of this company.

74
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:18,140
You will be the next CTO of this company.

75
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,410
Sure you don't want anything?

76
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:22,150
Pellegrino, tea?

77
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,520
Sir, thank you again for seeing me.

78
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:35,170
Tyrell, I'm gonna have to reschedule this.

79
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:37,280
- Anwar, set up another time. - Sir, it's just that I think--

80
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,460
I get it, I get it.

81
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,800
We'll get another meeting on the books right away.

82
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,480
We've got a really good CTO candidate

83
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,950
the board is very excited about.

84
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,070
They're not ready to discuss it yet.

85
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,550
We'll loop you in.

86
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,450
Just give us a couple of weeks, hmm?

87
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,910
Uh, put Wellick back on the books.

88
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:56,990
Two weeks.

89
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,620
Oh, nice tie.

90
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,590
Let me guess.

91
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,120
Brioni?

92
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,550
Great taste, as always.

93
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:05,620
Be well.

94
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,240
I'll email your assistant the details.

95
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,020
If you could,

96
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:18,720
just email it to me directly.

97
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,720
This is too important for me to miss.

98
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,610
Mr. Wellick, we're here.

99
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,420
You think I could have 300 this time?

100
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:06,790
Spoken like a true capitalist.

101
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,620
Bad day at the office?

102
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,240
No ki--

103
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:03,380
Please, enough. No more.

104
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,090
Most coders think debugging software

105
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:58,110
is about fixing a mistake,

106
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,880
but that's bullshit.

107
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,310
Debugging's actually all about finding the bug,

108
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:07,000
about understanding why the bug was there to begin with,

109
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:10,870
about knowing that its existence was no accident.

110
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:13,830
It came to you to deliver a message,

111
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,280
like an unconscious bubble floating to the surface,

112
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:21,190
popping with a revelation you've secretly known all along.

113
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:24,120
I don't know why I'm saying all of this.

114
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,690
Maybe it's because I'm pumped up on whatever---

115
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:30,390
legal drug dealers like Eli Lilly make money off nowadays.

116
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:33,520
But usually it's because there's a sense it's coming.

117
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,250
A bug buzzing its way towards me

118
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,590
to gum up the works until it forces me to make a call.

119
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:42,320
Kill me or embrace me.

120
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:45,120
Or maybe I'm just freaking out because I never thought

121
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,380
I'd wake up to find these two women staring back at me.

122
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,730
Are you awake?

123
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,100
I don't know.

124
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:04,680
What are you doing here?

125
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:09,790
We talked maybe a few hours ago when I first got here.

126
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,330
You don't remember?

127
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:14,090
They said I was your emergency contact.

128
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:22,180
Right. Um, you told them to call your psychiatrist.

129
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,610
You can't leave until you talk to one.

130
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,250
So I'm gonna wait outside.

131
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,120
Do you remember requesting me from the staff?

132
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:44,050
You requested me because the police said that--

133
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:46,790
I got jumped by a bunch of kids.

134
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,660
It's not the end of the world.

135
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,740
They wanted to do a full drug panel, and you refused.

136
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,120
May I ask why?

137
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:00,470
Elliot, if we can't have a conversation about this...

138
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,660
I've been taking morphine.

139
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,020
Why?

140
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:17,020
I don't have a good enough reason to give you.

141
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,730
I wish I did, but I don't.

142
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,640
Maybe we should consider rehab.

143
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,910
I'm not a junkie.

144
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,280
Then you'll need to prove it to me.

145
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,030
Submit to a bimonthly drug test voluntarily.

146
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:32,500
That's the only way that I'll recommend your release.

147
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:34,250
Hospitals.

148
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:35,820
A heavily networked one like this

149
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,920
are almost too easy to hack.

150
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,990
This is William Highsmith.

151
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:43,230
He's not only the head of the IT department here,

152
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:45,830
he is the IT department.

153
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,730
He's also an idiot,

154
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:50,120
not that I blame him because the people that hired him

155
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,800
are also idiots.

156
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,810
The poor guy only gets a budget of about 7,000 bucks a year,

157
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,640
and he's supposed to protect their network

158
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,180
from people like me?

159
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,240
He never stood a chance.

160
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,860
He uses useless virus scans, dated servers,

161
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:07,110
and security software that runs on Windows 98.

162
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,080
It's one of the reasons why I made this place

163
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,260
my primary care facility.

165
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:13,040
I can make my health records

166
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,140
look like every other obedient zombie out there.

168
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:19,320
Okay.

169
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:21,330
You don't have to worry.

170
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:23,540
I'm not gonna do morphine again.

171
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,450
Hey, you got some matches?

172
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,250
Thank you.

174
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:46,520
That's a nice breakfast.

175
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,690
Sorry. Credit card system is down.

177
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:53,380
Like I said,

178
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,090
the most difficult thing about debugging

179
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:56,860
isn't fixing the bug.

181
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,090
It's all about finding the bug.

182
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,320
For Evil Corp,

183
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,760
Mr. Robot found their bug in me.

184
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:06,300
I was the mistake that led to all of this.

185
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,310
I have to ask you one thing.

186
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:11,940
Did you have something to do with Vera getting busted?

187
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,340
Shit, Elliot.

188
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,500
You said you weren't gonna do anything.

189
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:20,320
He's on murder charges, do you know that?

190
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,030
His whole crew bounced.

191
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:24,950
I mean, I don't know what I'm gonna do for money now.

192
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:27,590
Just tell me, Elliot,

193
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,180
and don't lie.

194
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,290
Did you do something?

195
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,410
No.

196
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,590
Are you okay?

197
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,020
I mean, with everything that happened--

198
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,160
I'm fine.

199
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:52,900
What happened to your door?

200
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,420
You're not supposed to be here, okay?

201
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,250
I changed the locks for a reason.

202
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:04,330
Interesting toy,

203
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:06,810
but you may want to spend a little more scratch

204
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:09,090
if you actually want it to, you know,

205
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,300
work.

206
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,140
Check it.

208
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:15,750
Jessica Alba says she wants to join fsociety.

209
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:20,060
Jesus, what happened to your face?

210
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,890
What's going on?

211
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:28,530
Well, I am not the princess of social graces,

212
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:30,410
but typically it goes something like,

213
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:32,590
- "Hi, this is Darlene." - Stop.

214
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,780
You need to leave.

215
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:38,290
Babe, seriously, we have a lot of shit to discuss,

216
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:39,200
so if you wouldn't mind...

217
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,120
Get out.

218
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,700
I suggest you get a grip.

219
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,860
What was she talking about?

220
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:03,200
I got to get to work.

221
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,930
Work? Are you serious?

222
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:07,510
You can't go to work. You have to call in sick.

223
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:08,800
I have to go.

225
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:13,650
A bug is never just a mistake.

226
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,990
It represents something bigger.

227
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,040
An error of thinking.

228
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:28,540
- Sir! Sir! Sir! - That makes you who you are.

229
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,140
Sir! You dropped your wallet.

230
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,540
- Thanks. - Stop!

231
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,920
Stop! He stole my purse.

232
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:37,900
That was your wallet?

233
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,070
Yes, that was my wallet you just gave him.

234
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:42,310
Stop!

236
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:45,720
He got into my system, 

237
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,140
and he wants me to put the CD on one of the computers at work.

239
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:51,320
- Why does he want to do that? - I don't know, Stella.

240
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,760
He didn't give me a full explanation.

241
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,300
So he's got naked pics of me?

242
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,960
Is that the only thing you're seriously taking away

243
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,230
from this conversation?

244
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:00,840
Hey, babe.

245
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,310
How was your run?

246
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:04,910
Strange.

247
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,580
Someone dropped their wallet,

248
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:09,560
and I picked it up to give it to them, but then this--

249
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,480
Nothing strange about that-- 

250
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,480
just shows how good of a person you are.

251
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:13,720
Always have been.

252
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,270
Almost to a fault.

253
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:18,970
What does that mean?

254
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,170
Just that you--

255
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:25,760
you're too good for the world.

256
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,560
That's probably why I love you.

257
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,500
I'm gonna hop in the shower.

258
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,440
I told you I can't talk.

259
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,740
You have 100 hours precisely.

260
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,320
After that, everything we own will be released.

262
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:17,520
It's not enough just to focus your attention on the logs.

263
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,410
We should also monitor social media traffic

264
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:21,430
as well as IRC, Pastebin.

265
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:24,130
And set up scripts to keep going 24/7.

266
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,150
I mean, we might get lucky.

267
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,830
They might get sloppy, make a mistake, you know...

268
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,530
This is the world we live in.

269
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:33,140
People relying on each other's mistakes

270
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:36,350
to manipulate one another and use one another,

271
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,480
even relate to one another.

272
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:41,360
A warm, messy circle of humanity.

273
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,350
Elliot.

274
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:46,780
I'm inviting you guys to dinner tonight.

275
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,530
Morton's notwithstanding, I cook a mean steak.

276
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:56,890
What? Can't a boss invite his favorite employees to dinner?

277
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:59,980
No, that's cool, but I got plans.

278
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:06,320
Can you guys give us a minute?

279
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:09,400
Yeah.

280
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,420
You want to tell me what's going on?

281
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:17,550
Not really. 

282
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,590
You're missing work, you come in looking like that,

283
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:21,600
and you expect me not to ask questions?

284
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,480
Look, I don't know how much you want me asking

285
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,810
about your personal life, but--

286
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:27,900
Not at all, actually.

287
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,230
I mean, I don't mean to be rude.

288
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:35,470
I was-- I'm just being honest.

289
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:44,020
Mr. Robot may have found Evil Corp's bug,

290
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,680
but he didn't find mine.

291
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:48,660
That's the only way to protect myself.

292
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,330
Never show them my source code.

293
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:53,010
Close myself off.

294
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,960
Create my cold, perfect maze

295
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,830
where no one can ever find me.

296
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,410
Elliot, I cannot believe you work here.

297
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,150
This place is a shithole.

298
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,230
Look, I thought I'd swing by, take you to lunch.

299
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:06,830
Oh, that's nice.

300
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,870
I think she likes you, bud.

301
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:12,850
All right, fine, I'll take her,

302
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:15,430
but let the record show I was trying to be a good wingman.

303
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:17,930
Oh, calm down. Shit.

304
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,690
I'm not that into redheads anyway.

305
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:22,000
The whole nation of Ireland makes my dick soft.

306
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,320
Leave.

307
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,770
Darlene said we need to talk.

308
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:26,320
Leave now.

309
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,620
You're right. Probably shouldn't talk here.

310
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,210
Let's go to that bar next door.

311
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,850
I'm not going anywhere with you.

312
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,400
I'm not going anywhere until you do,

313
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,520
so I can hang out here and create a scene,

314
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:36,350
or you can give me five minutes at the bar next door.

315
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:37,860
Either way, I'm gonna have fun.

316
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,210
Dealer's choice.

317
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:48,470
What? It's an appletini.

318
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,060
I should kick your ass.

319
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:56,030
If that'll make us square, you have my blessing.

320
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,770
Nah, man, I want nothing to do with you.

321
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:59,350
You're a maniac.

322
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:02,860
What can I get for you?

323
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,370
Uh, nothing.

324
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,110
You should probably order something.

325
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:08,100
- I'd recommend this... - Fine.

326
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:13,100
I'll--I'll have an appletini.

327
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,350
You should take it as a compliment, guy.

328
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:18,300
These things are goddamn delicious.

329
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,720
I get it. Compliments make me uncomfortable too.

330
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,850
I find that hard to believe.

331
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:28,490
Yeah, who am I kidding? I love compliments.

332
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,410
$12.

333
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,150
I really don't think you enjoyed that.

334
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:53,390
- I suggest sipping-- - Last chance.

335
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,700
What do you want?

336
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,170
I'm sorry for what I did.

337
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,460
I don't buy it.

338
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,540
More importantly, I don't give a shit.

339
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,270
I never wanted to hurt you.

340
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,920
People who get violent get that way

341
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,900
because they can't communicate.

342
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:16,980
Your dad,

343
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:21,650
I bet he felt shitty for doing what he did.

344
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,430
I'm sure he wanted to apologize too.

345
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,690
Sometimes pushing your kid away is just easier.

346
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:31,220
Don't stay mad at him too long, kiddo.

347
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:35,250
You're leaving?

348
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:39,680
That's what you want, isn't it?

349
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,610
What about your plan?

350
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,430
Plan?

351
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,710
You're the key to the whole thing.

352
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,130
Without you, there is no plan.

353
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:58,330
That's it?

354
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:00,710
It's over?

355
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,290
Expect me to believe that?

356
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,180
See you in another life.

357
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:19,940
Did you hear that?

358
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,100
I can't believe it.

359
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,070
Is it really happening?

360
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,580
Fsociety finally over.

361
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:29,550
The recent glitch in the otherwise neat reality

362
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:31,520
I created over the years.

363
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:34,020
I'll never slip up like that again.

364
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:35,840
I'm gonna be more normal now.

365
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,430
Maybe Shayla could even be my girlfriend.

366
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:41,590
I'll go see those stupid Marvel movies with her.

367
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,200
I'll join a gym.

368
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,150
I'll heart things on Instagram.

369
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,610
I'll drink vanilla lattes.

370
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,570
I'm gonna lead a bug-free life from now on.

371
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:55,320
Anything to protect my perfect maze.

372
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:02,920
Hey, Gideon.

373
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:07,140
Is that dinner still on for tonight?

374
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:09,650
Um, yeah. Sure.

375
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,500
Uh, you want to come?

376
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:13,920
Yeah.

377
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:16,870
Great.

378
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,530
Can I bring my girlfriend?

379
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,270
You have a girlfriend?

380
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:28,580
Well, I, uh, haven't asked her yet,

381
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:29,780
but I will.

382
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:32,550
Hopefully she'll say yes.

383
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,230
Uh, yeah. Sure.

384
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:37,800
Perfect.

385
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:41,190
Thanks.

386
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:53,770
Was he drinking Starbucks?

387
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:11,170
Are you still trying to rip that CD?

388
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:13,550
Yeah, it's all-- it's all scratched up.

389
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:17,090
Let's get out of here.

404
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:31,080
My boss invited me to a dinner party at his place tonight.

405
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,630
I thought you could come as my girlfriend.

406
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:35,770
What?

407
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:39,670
Are you actually asking me to be your girlfriend right now?

408
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:41,910
Yeah.

409
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,410
Anyway, I need you.

410
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:47,200
I'm not good in social situations like that.

411
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,510
There is something seriously wrong with you.

412
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:55,290
I'm not gonna be used anymore.

413
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,420
Why don't you ask the girl from this morning, okay?

414
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,530
She seems like she might want to go to some stupid,

415
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,990
stuffy dinner party.

416
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,360
You don't actually know me.

417
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,070
All you know is that I'm the girl...

418
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,770
Of course I know Shayla.

420
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,980
I hacked her email as soon as she moved in next door.

423
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,650
With a simple phishing scam,

424
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:14,170
I owned her password pretty easily.

425
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:16,210
I'm not talking about the stuff you can find online.

426
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:17,860
I'm talking about the real me.

427
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:21,700
Tell me, then.

428
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:25,700
No. Forget it.

429
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,800
I want to know.

430
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:53,400
What is this?

431
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,370
I just put all the elements...

432
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:59,270
- It's beautiful. - Together.

433
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,730
I've never seen this before.

434
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,550
- She must-- - Never posted online.

435
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:04,330
Um, I mean, a lot of them's not--

436
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:05,460
they're not done.

437
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:08,710
She's got her own private maze too.

438
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:10,450
Took a lot of different pieces,

439
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,330
um, from different things,

440
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:16,310
like from my photographs or drawings and--

441
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:18,810
Like, there's this one.

442
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:23,630
Um, it's really f---ing corny,

443
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:26,770
but, like, it has everything-- the kids and the...

444
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:29,370
Shayla's bug was always elusive to me.

445
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:30,920
Maybe this was it.

446
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:34,310
Wanting normalcy but stuck in the outer fringes,

447
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,500
not knowing how to participate.

448
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:38,160
Just like me.

449
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,210
Can I kiss you?

450
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:55,100
Next time, don't ask.

451
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:56,890
It's lame.

452
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,980
Bugs usually get a bad rap.

453
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:03,110
But sometimes...

454
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,690
Don't let me down, okay?

455
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,370
When a bug finally makes itself known,

456
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,660
it can be exhilarating,

457
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,120
like you just unlocked something.

458
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,990
A grand opportunity

459
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,080
waiting to be taken advantage of.

460
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,250
Mr. Wellick?

461
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,960
What was your name again?

462
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:36,450
Anwar.

463
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:38,730
I didn't know you came to places like this.

464
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,140
I don't.

465
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,870
What do you mean? You're here now.

466
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,010
I'm here because you are.

467
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:48,930
What? Sorry, I don't get it.

468
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:52,430
I think you're beautiful. I want to take you home.

469
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,430
Wait, I thought you were married.

470
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:00,940
Because, after all, a bug's only purpose,

471
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:03,440
its only reason for existence

472
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:06,520
is to be a mistake that needs fixing,

473
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,880
to help you right a wrong.

474
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,590
And what feels better than that?

475
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:21,600
So, Elliot,

476
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:25,000
do you think you should introduce us?

477
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:30,000
Oh, um, Shayla, this is Angela and Ollie.

478
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:35,400
You, uh, you look lovely this evening.

479
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,030
What up, guys?

480
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:42,430
You just get here?

481
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:44,270
Nice suit.

482
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,590
Thanks, dude.

483
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:54,140
- Shit. - What is up with you?

484
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:55,690
You've been fidgeting all night.

485
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,510
Maybe we should try the doorbell again.

486
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,630
Hey, guys.

487
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,540
How long have you been standing out here?

488
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,800
The doorbell is broken. I should have warned you.

489
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,710
Come in. I'm Harry, by the way.

490
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:14,940
- Angela. Nice to meet you. - Good to meet you.

491
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,200
Always nice to put a face... 

492
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,340
with an employee badge number, right?

493
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:20,850
Ollie, how long have you guys been together?

494
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,090
- 2 1/2 years. - 2 years.

495
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,070
Okay.

496
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,660
Elliot, how long have you and Shayla been together?

497
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,320
Well, uh, um,

498
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:36,460
j-just today.

499
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:48,570
Okay, enough grilling of the guests.

500
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:50,640
Let's check on the real grill, shall we?

501
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,870
Elliot, I could use your help.

502
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,110
So I have a confession.

503
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:59,540
I had the sys admins at the data center in Dulles

504
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,820
check that server again.

505
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:03,870
Gideon, what did you do?

506
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:05,520
Of course there was nothing.

507
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,930
I have no idea what there was to even be suspicious about.

508
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:11,700
I mean, what possible motivation would you have

509
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:13,880
to do anything? I guess I was just being--

510
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,510
Gideon has to let this go.

511
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,170
If he comes near this hornet's nest,

512
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:19,150
I'm not sure I can save him from it.

513
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:21,370
I have to kill any suspicion left.

514
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:23,940
You've been nothing but a hard worker for Allsafe,

515
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:27,870
so I apologize.

516
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,170
After the conversation on the plane,

517
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:36,910
I knew what was at stake-- the whole company.

518
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:40,940
I was worried that the dat file I found wasn't the right one.

519
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,590
I just didn't

520
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,840
want to get your hopes up in case I was wrong.

521
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:49,820
That's why I didn't tell you before the meeting.

522
00:28:58,430 --> 00:28:59,690
Shit.

523
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:02,100
I'm gonna have to let him hug me, aren't I?

524
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:11,720
You're such a brilliant engineer, Elliot,

525
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:13,900
and you should never doubt your skills

526
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,760
no matter how much pressure I put on you.

527
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:18,150
And you certainly don't have to keep anything from me.

528
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:20,200
I care about you.

529
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:41,640
From the Mixed-up Files of Basil E. Frankweiler.

530
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,350
That's where I got the idea, remember?

531
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:48,610
I wanted to be Claudia Kincaid so bad.

532
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:52,200
Even her name was cool.

533
00:29:56,870 --> 00:30:01,640
Remember we thought we were going to the Met,

534
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,730
somehow we ended up at the Queens Museum instead?

535
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:10,290
No Google Maps back then.

536
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:14,880
I loved running away with you.

537
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,990
Somehow when you're eight,

538
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:22,750
running away can be fun.

539
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,870
The normal life.

540
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,750
Smiles, dinner parties,

541
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:32,000
childhood stories.

542
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,110
I could get used to this,

543
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,900
maybe even like it.

544
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:51,650
What's wrong?

545
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,720
Corp's hacking scandal continues

546
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,850
with the release of these latest emails.

548
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:03,560
Information stemming from the latest dump reveals

549
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,780
that Terry Colby was one of three high-level executives

550
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:09,810
involved in the cover-up of the widely publicized

551
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:12,410
Washington Township toxic waste scandal.

553
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:13,600
If these reports are true,

554
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,130
Colby may be facing more indictments.

555
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:17,620
In the ensuing 24 months

556
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:21,070
after the alleged toxic waste leak in 1993,

557
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:25,240
26 employees died from similar types of leukemia.

558
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:28,380
Evil Corp, however, managed to get the class-action lawsuit

559
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:31,880
filed against it by the surviving victims dismissed,

560
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,130
claiming there was no direct evidence linking

561
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:36,570
their factories to the diagnoses.

562
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:39,510
Now these emails indicate that Colby was in fact 

563
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:42,280
aware of the dangerous levels of toxicity

564
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,940
and kept it a secret as it

565
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:47,770
"Would not be cost-effective to retool the current systems

566
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:52,110
in place even if there are potential lawsuits."

567
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,840
Mr. Colby was unavailable for comment, but his lawyer...

568
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,600
My perfect maze

569
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,500
crumbling before my eyes.

570
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,880
Data dump are further proof Colby was set up,

571
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,390
but they didn't indicate by whom.

572
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,280
There's nothing to hide behind.

573
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,340
I didn't think it existed, but there it was.

574
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,220
Is.

575
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:13,470
Mr. Robot finally found my bug.

576
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:16,090
Linking the waste levels in Washington Township

577
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:18,160
to the victims' illnesses.

578
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,870
Legal analysts support the claim

579
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:21,460
that there is not enough evidence...

580
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:22,410
What's going on?

581
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:26,720
That's how my mom, um, and Elliot's dad--

582
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:28,260
- I have to go. - Wait, wait.

583
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,740
- Let me come with you. - No, I'd rather you didn't.

584
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,810
Evidence in the Washington Township scandal.

585
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:34,720
Terry Colby remains under investigation

586
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,100
for his alleged involvement with the...

587
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:40,020
Dismissed because there was no evidence

588
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:42,050
linking the waste levels in Washington Township...

589
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:43,260
Evil Corp...

590
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,460
Don't look so sad.

591
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:48,230
He did this to himself.

592
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,150
He gave in. He was a coward.

593
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:53,280
He was weak and pathetic.

594
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,260
And in the end, that's what killed your father.

595
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,290
Why are you crying?

596
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,880
Don't ask so many questions.

597
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:05,180
I miss him.

598
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,290
There's no point to that.

599
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,470
But I do.

600
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:11,720
Then you're just as weak as him.

601
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:13,870
You're not sad?

602
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,260
Why should I be?

603
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:19,410
It's a beautiful night.

604
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:22,510
The weather is nice,

605
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:24,730
and I'm enjoying my cigarette.

606
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:33,040
The bug forces the software to adapt,

607
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,680
evolve into something new because of it.

608
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:38,190
Work around it or work through it.

609
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:41,670
No matter what, it changes.

610
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:44,370
It becomes something new.

611
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,140
The next version.

612
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,210
The inevitable upgrade.

613
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,450
You're a strange creature.

614
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:36,130
I'm just a businessman.

615
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:44,470
And that's about as clean as I'm gonna get it.

616
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,000
You have to do the rest in the shower.

617
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:49,400
I don't mind being a little dirty.

618
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:50,840
I do.

629
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,640
You should join me.

630
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:15,200
Yeah, I'll be there in a minute.

631
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,790
I'm sorry that I ran off like that.

632
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:37,620
Did you talk to him?

633
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,520
Nope. He wasn't home.

634
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,500
Well, I'm here.

635
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,560
I want to talk to you about everything,

636
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,120
just not tonight, okay?

637
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:48,310
So you talk to him but not your own boyfriend?

638
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,710
It's different, Ollie.

639
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:51,820
Both of our parents died because...

640
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,790
That's how we know each other.

641
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:00,350
I really don't want to talk about this right now.

642
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:02,610
What if I do?

643
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:05,590
What if you do what?

644
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,080
Want to talk.

645
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:10,980
About...

646
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:13,740
something.

647
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:20,120
What the hell are you talking about?

648
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:24,370
I have to tell you something.

649
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:28,510
I don't know why you're putting yourself through this.

650
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:30,890
You don't have to keep looking at it.

651
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:33,310
All right? It meant nothing.

652
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,340
Okay, I know I sound like a broken record,

654
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,240
but I love you, and I want to be with you.

655
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,580
Stop speaking.

656
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:48,150
Just tell me what you need

657
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:51,010
in order for me to fix this, and I'll do it.

658
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,910
We need to break up.

659
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,090
Angela, come on.

660
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:02,850
What choice did you give me, Ollie?

661
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:04,650
Look, I know I have a problem.

662
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:05,460
I'm not denying that.

663
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,660
Well, maybe my problem is

664
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:09,360
I can't be with a guy with your problem.

665
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,080
Where's the CD?

666
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,110
It's in my-- in my bag. Why?

667
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,250
He has my bank account, Ollie.

668
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:22,560
- And my dad's bank account. - How did they--

669
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,740
Our accounts are linked because of my student loans.

670
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:26,910
I used your laptop to access it.

671
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:28,510
He has my dad's social security,

672
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:30,760
his credit card numbers, everything.

673
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:32,650
Okay.

674
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:33,970
Okay, that is bad,

675
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:35,640
but I'm sure the cops will figure out a way--

676
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,920
If we don't do what this guy says

677
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,680
and we go to the cops, then he's just going to sell

678
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,970
our information to the highest bidder,

679
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:43,320
and me and my dad are completely screwed.

680
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:46,030
Do you have any idea how difficult it is

681
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,820
to come back from massive identity theft like this?

682
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:51,090
What are you saying?

683
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:59,590
Angela, are you crazy?

684
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:02,840
No, we cannot just infect Allsafe's network

685
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:04,230
because of this.

686
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,970
I'll lose my job.

687
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,300
And there it is.

688
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:18,040
You'll lose your job too,

689
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:19,760
if that matters.

690
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:25,160
Besides, even if we put the CD in,

691
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,770
who says this guy won't just do all this anyway?

692
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,840
Hey, hey, come here.

693
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,130
Look at me.

694
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,610
We are going to figure this out.

695
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,610
Okay?

696
00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:58,930
You're right. You're right.

697
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:00,890
I'm sorry.

698
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,460
I'm just scared.

699
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:05,430
I don't want to break up with you.

700
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:07,340
I'm sorry that I said that.

701
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:16,260
I love you so much.

705
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,670
This is admin, Dulles.

706
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:49,160
Yeah, hi, this is Gideon Goddard at Allsafe Security.

707
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:53,090
I need to talk to Sean Skyler about server CS30 again.

708
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:54,750
Hold please. I'll transfer you.

732
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,090
Here's the plan.
