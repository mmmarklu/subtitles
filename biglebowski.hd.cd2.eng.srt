1
00:00:00,083 --> 00:00:02,920
Probably a vagrant
slept in the car

2
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:05,088
or just used it as a toilet.

3
00:00:05,172 --> 00:00:07,508
Hey, man...

4
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:10,552
Are you gonna find
these guys, you know...

5
00:00:10,636 --> 00:00:13,889
I mean, you got any
promising, uh, leads or...

6
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:17,100
Leads? Yeah, sure.

7
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:21,230
I'll just check with the boys
down at the crime lab.

8
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:24,650
They got four more detectives
working on the case.

9
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:27,152
They got us working in shifts.

10
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,992
Leads?

11
00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:36,161
I hope the big Lebowski kills me

12
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:39,665
before the Germans
can cut my dick off.

13
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,544
That is just ridiculous, Dude.
No one'll cut your dick off.

14
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:46,547
- Thank you.
- Not if I have anything to say.

15
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:49,216
- That makes me feel secure.
- Dude.

16
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:52,135
- It makes me feel warm inside.
- Now, Dude.

17
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:54,471
This whole fuckin' thing.

18
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:59,017
I could be sitting here
with just pee stains on my rug.

19
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:02,062
- But, no, man, I gotta...
- Fucking Germans.

20
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:05,190
Nothing changes. Fucking Nazis.

21
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:07,609
They were Nazis, Dude?

22
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:10,821
Come on, Donny, they
were threatening castration.

23
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,948
- Are we gonna split hairs?
- No.

24
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:15,033
- Am I wrong?
- Well, he...

25
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:16,785
They were nihilists, man.

26
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:19,329
They kept saying
they believed in nothing.

27
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:22,082
Nihilists.

28
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,668
Fuck me.

29
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:29,214
Say what you want about the
tenets of national socialism,

30
00:01:29,298 --> 00:01:31,508
at least it's an ethos.

31
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:34,344
And also,
let's not forget, Dude,

32
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:37,890
that keeping wildlife,
an amphibious rodent

33
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:40,642
for, you know, domestic...

34
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:42,686
within the city...

35
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,730
That ain't legal either.

36
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:48,066
- Are you a fucking park ranger?
- No, I'm just...

37
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:51,195
Who gives a shit
about the fucking marmot?

38
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:54,531
- We are sympathising, Dude.
- Fuck sympathy.

39
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:58,660
I don't need your fucking
sympathy. I need my johnson.

40
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:02,122
- What do you need that for?
- You've got to buck up!

41
00:02:02,206 --> 00:02:05,667
You cannot drag this negative
energy into the tournament.

42
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:08,837
Fuck the tournament.
Fuck you, Walter.

43
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:11,882
Fuck the tournament?

44
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:15,844
OK, Dude. I can see you
don't want to be cheered up.

45
00:02:15,928 --> 00:02:19,264
Come on, Donny.
Let's go get us a lane.

46
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:26,188
- Another Caucasian, Gary.
- Right, Dude.

47
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,442
Friends like these,
huh, Gary?

48
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:32,611
That's right, Dude.

49
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:57,803
Do you have a good Sarsaparilla?

50
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,888
Sioux City Sarsaparilla?

51
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:02,474
Yeah. That's a good one.

52
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,520
How you doin' there, Dude?

53
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:09,523
Not too good, man.

54
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:13,443
- One of those days, huh?
- Yeah.

55
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,153
Well...

56
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:18,115
A wiser fella than myself
once said,

57
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:21,493
"Sometimes you eat
the bar and..."

58
00:03:21,577 --> 00:03:23,787
Much obliged.

59
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:26,415
"And sometimes the bar, well...

60
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:28,292
"he eats you."

61
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:31,712
That some kind of Eastern thing?

62
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,590
Far from it.

63
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:42,723
I like your style, Dude.

64
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:45,184
Hmm. Well...

65
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:47,603
I dig your style, too, man.

66
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:50,189
You got
a whole cowboy thing going.

67
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:55,402
Thankee.

68
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:59,364
- There's just one thing, Dude.
- What's that?

69
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:02,826
Do you have to use
so many cuss words?

70
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,247
What the fuck
are you talking about?

71
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:12,586
OK, Dude, have it your way.

72
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:16,340
Take her easy, Dude.

73
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,842
Yeah. Thanks, man.

74
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:26,266
Call for you, Dude.

75
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:30,979
Hello?

76
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:34,107
'Jeffrey, you have
not gone to the doctor.'

77
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:37,402
Uh, oh, yeah.
No... no, I haven't yet.

78
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:40,072
'I'd like to
see you immediately.'

79
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:41,782
Oh?

80
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:57,422
- So you're Lebowski.
- Yeah.

81
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,094
Maude has told me all about you.

82
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:05,347
She'll be back
in a minute. Sit down.

83
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,809
- Do you want a drink?
- Yeah, sure. White Russian.

84
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:11,436
The bar's over there.

85
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:19,945
- So what do you do, Lebowski?
- Who the fuck are you, man?

86
00:05:21,697 --> 00:05:23,574
Just a friend of Maudie's.

87
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:25,784
The friend
with the cleft asshole?

88
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:30,497
What do you do?

89
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:32,624
Oh, nothing much.

90
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,751
Hello, Jeffrey.

91
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:38,130
Yeah, how are you?
Listen, Maude,

92
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:40,799
I got to, uh...

93
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:44,261
tender my resignation
or whatever.

94
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:49,600
It looks like your mother
really was kidnapped after all.

95
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,476
She most certainly was not.

96
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,646
Hey, man,
why don't you fucking...

97
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,941
listen occasionally?
You might learn something.

98
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:00,903
- Now, I got...
- Don't call her my mother.

99
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,698
She's the perpetrator
and not the victim.

100
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:07,659
I got pretty
definitive evidence...

101
00:06:07,743 --> 00:06:10,704
- From who?
- From the main guy, Uli.

102
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,832
Uli Kunkel? Her co... star
in the beaver picture?

103
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:16,710
Beaver? You mean vagina...

104
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,129
I mean, you know the guy?

105
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:22,216
I might have introduced them
for all I know.

106
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:24,301
Do you remember Uli?

107
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,804
He's a musician.
Used to have a group, Autobahn.

108
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:31,183
They released
one album in the late 70s.

109
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:34,436
Their music is
sort of a... technopop.

110
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,939
So he's pretending
to be the abductor?

111
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:39,233
- Well, yeah.
- Look, Jeffrey,

112
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:41,985
you don't kidnap someone
you're acquainted with.

113
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:44,613
The idea is that the hostage
can't identify you

114
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:47,241
- after you've let them go.
- I know that.

115
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:54,957
What the fuck
is with this guy? Who is he?

116
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,585
Knox Harrington.
The video artist.

117
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:02,297
- So Uli has the money?
- Well...

118
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:04,842
No, not exactly...

119
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:07,719
This is a very
complicated case, Maude.

120
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:11,431
A lot of ins and outs
and what... have... yous...

121
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:14,601
A lot of strands
to keep in my head.

122
00:07:14,685 --> 00:07:17,062
A lot of strands
in old Duder's head.

123
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,605
Then who has the money?

124
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:21,567
It's Sandra, about the Biennale.

125
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:25,153
I have to take this. Do you
have that doctor's number?

126
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:28,699
- It's not bruised any more.
- Please, Jeffrey,

127
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:32,536
I don't want to be responsible
for any delayed after... effects.

128
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,373
After... effects?

129
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,906
Could you slide your shorts
down, Mr Lebowski, please?

130
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:11,825
No, man. She hit me right here.

131
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:13,660
I understand.

132
00:08:13,744 --> 00:08:17,414
Could you slide
your shorts down, please?

133
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,234
He lives in North Hollywood,

134
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:52,402
on Radford,
near the In 'n' Out Burger.

135
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:54,321
The In 'n' Out Burger's
on Camrose.

136
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:56,657
- Near it.
- Those are good burgers.

137
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,575
Shut the fuck up, Donny.

138
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:01,620
The kid's in ninth grade,
and his father...

139
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:05,791
Are you ready for this? His
father is Arthur Digby Sellers.

140
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:07,709
Who the fuck is that?

141
00:11:07,793 --> 00:11:10,337
Who the fuck is
Arthur Digby Sellers?

142
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,674
Ever heard of a show
called "Branded"?

143
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:17,052
"All but one man died
there at Bitter Creek"?

144
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:19,263
I know the fucking show.
So what?

145
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:23,225
Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers
wrote 156 episodes, Dude.

146
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:25,936
The bulk of the series.

147
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,564
- Not exactly a lightweight.
- No.

148
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:32,234
And yet his son
is a fucking dunce.

149
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:34,736
We'll go there
after the what... have... you,

150
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,697
we'll brace the kid.

151
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,782
We'll be near
the In 'n' Out Burger.

152
00:11:38,866 --> 00:11:41,326
Shut the fuck up, Donny!

153
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:45,247
We'll brace the kid.
He should be a pushover.

154
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,541
We'll get that fucking
$1 million back...

155
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:49,585
If he hasn't spent it already.

156
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:51,628
A million fucking clams.

157
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:55,048
- Yes, we'll be near the, uh...
- In 'n' Out.

158
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,845
Some burgers, some beers,
a few laughs.

159
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:05,058
Our fucking troubles
are over, Dude.

160
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:19,114
Oh, fuck me, man!

161
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:22,326
That kid's already spent
all the money, man!

162
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:24,912
New 'vette? Hardly, Dude.

163
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:28,624
I'd say he still has
960, $970,000 left,

164
00:12:28,707 --> 00:12:31,960
depending on the options.
Wait in the car, Donny.

165
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:37,883
- Yes?
- Pilar?

166
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:40,636
My name is Walter Sobchak.

167
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:43,764
This is my associate
Jeffrey Lebowski.

168
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:47,809
We came to talk about
little Larry. May we come in?

169
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:50,062
- Yes, yes.
- Thank you.

170
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,818
That's him, Dude.

171
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:06,787
And a good day to you, sir!

172
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,248
Sit down, please.

173
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,547
Larry, sweetie,
that man is here!

174
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:20,050
Is he... Does he still write?

175
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:23,220
Oh, no, no.
He has health problems.

176
00:13:25,848 --> 00:13:29,309
Sir, I just want to say

177
00:13:29,393 --> 00:13:32,855
that we're both,
on a personal level,

178
00:13:32,938 --> 00:13:34,940
really enormous fans.

179
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:38,068
"Branded", especially
the early episodes,

180
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,571
was truly a source
of inspiration...

181
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:43,240
Sweetie, sit down!
This is the police.

182
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:46,910
Oh, no, ma'am,
we are not exactly the police.

183
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:49,496
We hope it won't
be necessary to call the police.

184
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:52,249
But that's up
to little Larry here.

185
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:54,668
Isn't it, Larry?

186
00:14:04,595 --> 00:14:06,680
Is this your homework, Larry?

187
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:11,226
- Is this your homework?
- Look, man...

188
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:14,688
Dude, please.
Is this your homework, Larry?

189
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:16,565
Just ask him about the car.

190
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:19,735
- Is this your homework, Larry?
- Is that your car out front?

191
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:23,030
- Is this your homework, Larry?
- We know it's his homework!

192
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:24,698
Where's the fucking money?

193
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:26,825
Look, Larry...

194
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:28,577
Have you heard of Vietnam?

195
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,663
You're entering
a world of pain, son.

196
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:33,707
We know that you stole the car.

197
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,834
- And the fucking money!
- And the fucking money.

198
00:14:35,918 --> 00:14:38,045
We know that this
is your homework.

199
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:41,131
- We'll cut your dick off.
- You're killing your father.

200
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:46,553
All right. This is pointless.

201
00:14:46,637 --> 00:14:49,515
OK? It's time for plan B.

202
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:55,938
You might want to watch out
that front window, Larry.

203
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:57,856
Son, this is what happens

204
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,192
when you fuck a stranger
in the ass!

205
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:03,529
Little language problem here.

206
00:15:03,612 --> 00:15:06,990
The little prick's
stonewalling me.

207
00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:08,825
Walter!

208
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:10,911
What... what are you doing, man?

209
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,165
What are you doing?

210
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:20,295
Here you go, Larry.
You see what happens?

211
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:22,923
You see what happens, Larry?

212
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,135
This is what happens

213
00:15:27,219 --> 00:15:30,430
when you fuck a stranger
in the ass, Larry!

214
00:15:31,515 --> 00:15:33,392
This is what happens, Larry!

215
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:35,769
You see what happens, Larry,

216
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:38,355
when you fuck a stranger
in the ass?

217
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,023
This is what happens.

218
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:41,900
You see what happens, Larry?

219
00:15:43,277 --> 00:15:45,195
You see what happens, Larry?

220
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,947
Do you see what happens, Larry,

221
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:49,324
when you fuck a stranger
in the ass?

222
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:53,745
This is what happens, Larry!
This is what happens, Larry!

223
00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:56,081
- No!
- This is what happens, Larry!

224
00:15:56,165 --> 00:15:58,876
This is what happens
when you fuck a stranger...

225
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,211
What the fuck
are you doing? Stop it!

226
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:03,839
I just bought
that fucking car last week!

227
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:07,050
I'm gonna fuckin' kill you!

228
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:09,511
I just bought
the fucking car last week!

229
00:16:09,595 --> 00:16:12,181
I'll kill your
fucking car, man!

230
00:16:12,264 --> 00:16:13,974
No! That's not his... hey!

231
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:16,852
- God damn it!
- No! Oh, no!

232
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:19,897
Fuck you! You like that?

233
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:23,150
Fuck you!
I kill your fucking car!

234
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:26,570
I kill your fucking car!

235
00:16:46,632 --> 00:16:48,800
I accept your apology.

236
00:16:50,928 --> 00:16:54,806
No. I just... want to
handle it by myself from now on.

237
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:57,267
No, no, no.

238
00:16:57,351 --> 00:17:00,103
That has nothing to do with it.

239
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:02,731
Yes, the car made it home.

240
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:05,234
You're calling me at home.

241
00:17:05,317 --> 00:17:10,948
No, Walter, it did not look
like Larry was about to crack.

242
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:14,993
Well, that's your perception.

243
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:18,831
You know, Walter, you're right.

244
00:17:18,914 --> 00:17:21,917
There is an unspoken message
here. It's "Fuck you"!

245
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,127
Leave me the fuck alone!

246
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:28,715
Yeah, I'll be at practice.

247
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:49,778
Pin your diapers on. Jackie
Treehorn wants to see you.

248
00:17:49,862 --> 00:17:52,948
Jackie Treehorn knows
which Lebowski you are.

249
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:55,701
Jackie Treehorn wants to see
the deadbeat Lebowski.

250
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:57,661
You're not dealing with morons.

251
00:18:45,209 --> 00:18:48,378
Hello, Dude. Thanks for coming.

252
00:18:48,462 --> 00:18:50,547
I'm Jackie Treehorn.

253
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:55,969
This is quite a pad
you got here, man.

254
00:18:56,053 --> 00:18:58,472
Completely unspoiled.

255
00:18:58,555 --> 00:19:01,683
- What's your drink, Dude?
- White Russian. Thanks.

256
00:19:01,767 --> 00:19:03,685
White Russian.

257
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:06,271
How's the smut business, Jackie?

258
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:08,065
I wouldn't know, Dude.

259
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:10,901
I deal in publishing,

260
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:13,195
entertainment,
political advocacy.

261
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:16,907
- Oh. Which one's "Logjammin"'?
- Yes, regrettably, it's true.

262
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:20,077
Standards have fallen
in adult entertainment.

263
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,037
It's video, Dude.

264
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,665
Now that we're
competing with amateurs,

265
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:27,584
we can't afford to invest
in extras, like story,

266
00:19:27,668 --> 00:19:29,962
production value,

267
00:19:30,045 --> 00:19:32,130
feelings.

268
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:35,300
You know, people forget

269
00:19:35,384 --> 00:19:39,096
that the brain is
the biggest erogenous zone.

270
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,181
On you maybe.

271
00:19:41,265 --> 00:19:43,350
You have to take
the good with the bad.

272
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:46,353
New technology permits us
to do exciting things

273
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:50,691
in interactive erotic software.
Wave of the future, Dude.

274
00:19:50,774 --> 00:19:53,235
100% electronic.

275
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:57,030
Well...
I still jerk off manually.

276
00:19:58,407 --> 00:19:59,908
Of course you do.

277
00:19:59,992 --> 00:20:03,579
I can see you're anxious
for me to get to the point.

278
00:20:03,662 --> 00:20:05,455
Well, here it is, Dude.

279
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:07,499
Where's Bunny?

280
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:10,836
- I thought you might know that.
- Why would I?

281
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:14,882
She ran off to get away from
that sizeable debt to me.

282
00:20:14,965 --> 00:20:17,593
She didn't run off.
She's been...

283
00:20:17,676 --> 00:20:19,553
I've heard that story.

284
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:22,973
I know you're
mixed up in this, Dude.

285
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:26,643
I don't care what you're
trying to get from the husband.

286
00:20:26,727 --> 00:20:28,520
That's your business.

287
00:20:28,604 --> 00:20:30,606
All I'm saying is...

288
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:33,025
- I want mine.
- Yeah, right, man.

289
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:35,861
There are a lot of...
facets to this,

290
00:20:35,944 --> 00:20:38,822
a lot of interested parties.

291
00:20:38,906 --> 00:20:41,533
Excuse me.

292
00:20:46,747 --> 00:20:48,332
Yeah?

293
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:49,791
Oh, yeah.

294
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:51,460
Where's that?

295
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:56,298
All right.

296
00:20:59,885 --> 00:21:01,678
Excuse me.

297
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:40,217
- Forgive me.
- No problemo, man.

298
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,344
So, uh...

299
00:21:42,427 --> 00:21:45,514
If I, uh, can find your money...

300
00:21:45,597 --> 00:21:49,184
What's in it for the Dude?

301
00:21:49,268 --> 00:21:51,854
Of course, there's that
to discuss. Refill?

302
00:21:51,937 --> 00:21:53,772
The Pope shit in the woods?

303
00:21:53,856 --> 00:21:56,483
10% finder's fee.
That all right?

304
00:21:56,567 --> 00:21:59,236
OK. Done, Jackie.

305
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:01,697
I dig the way
you do business, man.

306
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:06,076
Your money is being held
by a kid named Larry Sellers.

307
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,204
He lives in North Hollywood,
on Radford, uh...

308
00:22:09,288 --> 00:22:12,082
by the In 'n' Out Burger.

309
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:14,418
A fuckin' brat,

310
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:16,420
but I'm sure
you can get it off him.

311
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:19,047
I mean, he's 15.

312
00:22:20,048 --> 00:22:22,509
Flunking social studies.

313
00:22:25,637 --> 00:22:27,973
So, if you could just, uh...

314
00:22:28,056 --> 00:22:32,978
write me a cheque
for my 10% of half a million...

315
00:22:33,061 --> 00:22:35,981
five grand...
I'll go out and mingle.

316
00:22:40,485 --> 00:22:43,989
You mix a hell
of a Caucasian, Jackie.

317
00:22:44,156 --> 00:22:46,366
A 15... year... old kid.

318
00:22:47,284 --> 00:22:50,037
Is this some sort of a joke?

319
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,122
No, no joke.

320
00:22:52,206 --> 00:22:55,876
No funny stuff, Jackie.
The kid's got it.

321
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:58,128
Hi, fellas.

322
00:22:59,588 --> 00:23:01,965
The kid just wanted a car.

323
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:08,764
All the Dude ever wanted
was his rug back.

324
00:23:08,847 --> 00:23:10,182
I'm not greedy.

325
00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:14,645
It really...

326
00:23:14,728 --> 00:23:16,438
tied the room together.

327
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:23,070
Darkness washed over the Dude.

328
00:23:23,153 --> 00:23:25,781
Darker than
a black steer's tookus

329
00:23:25,864 --> 00:23:29,034
on a moonless prairie night.

330
00:23:29,326 --> 00:23:30,953
There was no bottom.

331
00:27:23,685 --> 00:27:25,604
Branded!

332
00:27:39,368 --> 00:27:42,037
Is this your only I. D?

333
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,373
I know my rights, man.

334
00:27:46,875 --> 00:27:51,004
- You don't know shit, Lebowski.
- I want a fucking lawyer, man.

335
00:27:51,088 --> 00:27:55,133
I want... Bill Kunstler, man...

336
00:27:56,301 --> 00:27:58,011
or Ron Coobie.

337
00:27:58,095 --> 00:27:59,847
Mr Treehorn tells us

338
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:04,101
that he had to eject you
from his garden party,

339
00:28:04,184 --> 00:28:06,186
that you were drunk
and abusive.

340
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:11,525
Mr Treehorn treats objects
like women, man.

341
00:28:11,608 --> 00:28:14,820
Mr Treehorn draws
a lot of water in this town.

342
00:28:14,903 --> 00:28:17,239
You don't draw shit, Lebowski.

343
00:28:17,322 --> 00:28:20,659
We got a nice quiet
little beach community here,

344
00:28:20,742 --> 00:28:23,078
and I aim to keep it
nice and quiet.

345
00:28:23,162 --> 00:28:25,247
So let me make something plain.

346
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:27,875
I don't like you sucking around,

347
00:28:27,958 --> 00:28:29,960
bothering our citizens,
Lebowski.

348
00:28:30,043 --> 00:28:32,546
I don't like your jerk... off name,

349
00:28:32,629 --> 00:28:34,423
I don't like your jerk... off face,

350
00:28:34,506 --> 00:28:36,967
I don't like
your jerk... off behaviour,

351
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:40,179
and I don't like you... Jerk... off.

352
00:28:42,598 --> 00:28:44,683
Do I make myself clear?

353
00:28:47,603 --> 00:28:49,980
I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.

354
00:28:52,566 --> 00:28:54,610
Fucking fascist!

355
00:28:55,694 --> 00:28:58,530
Stay out of Malibu, Lebowski!

356
00:28:58,614 --> 00:29:00,991
Stay out of Malibu, deadbeat!

357
00:29:02,618 --> 00:29:06,788
Keep your ugly goldbricking ass
out of my beach community.

358
00:29:19,092 --> 00:29:22,721
Jesus... Man, could you
change the channel.

359
00:29:22,804 --> 00:29:26,308
If you don't like my music,
get your own fucking cab!

360
00:29:26,391 --> 00:29:28,894
I'll pull over
and kick your ass out.

361
00:29:28,977 --> 00:29:32,731
I had a rough night,
and I hate the fucking Eagles.

362
00:29:41,156 --> 00:29:43,659
Out of my fucking cab!
Out! Get...

363
00:29:43,742 --> 00:29:45,911
Hey... man!

364
00:29:45,994 --> 00:29:48,163
Man, hey!

365
00:30:29,997 --> 00:30:33,292
Oh... Jesus.

366
00:30:51,476 --> 00:30:53,437
Jeffrey.

367
00:30:54,479 --> 00:30:55,981
Maude?

368
00:30:56,064 --> 00:30:58,025
Love me.

369
00:30:59,443 --> 00:31:01,320
Uh, that's my robe.

370
00:31:02,488 --> 00:31:05,657
Tell me about yourself, Jeffrey.

371
00:31:05,741 --> 00:31:08,118
Well, not much to tell.

372
00:31:08,202 --> 00:31:13,165
I, um, I was one of the authors

373
00:31:13,248 --> 00:31:15,459
of the Port Huron statement.

374
00:31:15,542 --> 00:31:17,503
The original
Port Huron statement.

375
00:31:19,713 --> 00:31:23,592
Not the compromised
second draft.

376
00:31:24,051 --> 00:31:26,512
Uh, and then I, uh,

377
00:31:26,595 --> 00:31:28,722
you ever hear of the Seattle 7?

378
00:31:28,805 --> 00:31:32,267
That was me.

379
00:31:32,351 --> 00:31:37,147
And, um, the six other guys.

380
00:31:37,231 --> 00:31:41,276
Um... and then,
ah, music business briefly.

381
00:31:43,111 --> 00:31:45,823
- Yeah, a roadie for Metallica.
- Oh.

382
00:31:45,906 --> 00:31:49,701
- "Speed of Sound" tour.
- Mm... hmm.

383
00:31:49,785 --> 00:31:52,246
Bunch of assholes.

384
00:31:52,329 --> 00:31:54,998
Uh, and then, you know,

385
00:31:55,082 --> 00:31:57,209
a little of this,
a little of that.

386
00:31:57,292 --> 00:32:00,712
My career's slowed down
a little lately.

387
00:32:00,796 --> 00:32:05,050
What do you do for recreation?

388
00:32:05,133 --> 00:32:10,430
Oh, the usual.
Bowl, drive around.

389
00:32:10,514 --> 00:32:13,559
The occasional acid flashback.

390
00:32:19,147 --> 00:32:21,942
What happened to your house?

391
00:32:22,025 --> 00:32:24,111
Oh, Jackie Treehorn
trashed the place.

392
00:32:24,194 --> 00:32:26,947
He thought I had
your father's money.

393
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:29,867
He got me out of the way
while he looked for it.

394
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:32,536
- Cocktail?
- No, thanks.

395
00:32:32,619 --> 00:32:35,789
It's not my father's money.
It's the Foundation's.

396
00:32:35,873 --> 00:32:39,501
Why did he think you have it?
And who does?

397
00:32:39,585 --> 00:32:42,171
Larry Sellers,
this high school kid.

398
00:32:42,254 --> 00:32:43,839
Real fucking brat.

399
00:32:43,922 --> 00:32:48,093
You know, this is a very
complicated case, Maude.

400
00:32:48,177 --> 00:32:51,221
Lotta ins, lotta outs.
You know, fortunately,

401
00:32:51,305 --> 00:32:53,807
I'm adhering
to a pretty strict...

402
00:32:53,891 --> 00:32:57,060
drug regiment to keep
my mind, you know,

403
00:32:57,144 --> 00:32:58,937
uh, limber, you know.

404
00:32:59,021 --> 00:33:01,064
Very close
to your father's money.

405
00:33:01,148 --> 00:33:05,027
It's the Foundation's money.
Father doesn't have any.

406
00:33:06,904 --> 00:33:09,573
What are you talking about?
He's loaded.

407
00:33:09,656 --> 00:33:12,409
No, no, the wealth
was all mother's.

408
00:33:12,493 --> 00:33:14,703
No, he runs stuff, uh...

409
00:33:14,786 --> 00:33:18,207
We did let him run a company,
but he didn't do very well.

410
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:21,293
- No, he's...
- He administers the charities,

411
00:33:21,376 --> 00:33:24,421
and I give him
a reasonable allowance.

412
00:33:24,505 --> 00:33:26,423
He has no money of his own.

413
00:33:26,507 --> 00:33:29,968
I know how he presents himself.
Father's weakness is vanity.

414
00:33:30,052 --> 00:33:35,682
- Hence, the slut.
- Uh, do you think he, uh...

415
00:33:36,975 --> 00:33:39,061
What is that, yoga?

416
00:33:39,144 --> 00:33:41,647
It increases
the chances of conception.

417
00:33:43,273 --> 00:33:45,526
- Increases?
- Well, yes.

418
00:33:45,609 --> 00:33:48,779
What did you think this
was about? Fun and games?

419
00:33:48,862 --> 00:33:51,281
I want a child.

420
00:33:51,365 --> 00:33:53,659
OK, yeah, OK, but let me...

421
00:33:53,742 --> 00:33:57,120
Let me explain
something about the Dude.

422
00:33:57,204 --> 00:33:59,998
Look, Jeffrey,
I don't want a partner.

423
00:34:00,082 --> 00:34:04,002
I don't want the father
to be someone I have to see,

424
00:34:04,086 --> 00:34:08,090
or who has any interest
in raising the child himself.

425
00:34:08,173 --> 00:34:11,093
Oh, so that doctor...

426
00:34:11,176 --> 00:34:13,178
Exactly.

427
00:34:13,262 --> 00:34:15,430
Now, what happened to your face?

428
00:34:15,514 --> 00:34:18,267
Did Jackie Treehorn
do that as well?

429
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:22,229
No, uh, it was
the Chief of Police of Malibu.

430
00:34:22,312 --> 00:34:25,899
A real reactionary.
So, your father...

431
00:34:27,568 --> 00:34:30,779
- Yeah, I get it. Yeah, yeah.
- What?

432
00:34:30,863 --> 00:34:33,240
Oh, man, my thinking
about this case

433
00:34:33,323 --> 00:34:37,202
had become very uptight.
Yeah, your father.

434
00:34:39,037 --> 00:34:41,623
Jeffrey,
what are you talking about?

435
00:34:43,292 --> 00:34:44,835
Jeffrey!

436
00:34:44,918 --> 00:34:47,004
Walter, if you're there,

437
00:34:47,087 --> 00:34:49,464
pick up the fucking phone.
Come on.

438
00:34:49,548 --> 00:34:52,259
Pick it up, man,
this is an emergency.

439
00:34:52,342 --> 00:34:53,719
'Dude? '

440
00:34:53,802 --> 00:34:57,598
I'm at my place. I need you
to come and pick me up.

441
00:34:57,681 --> 00:35:00,184
'I can't drive, Dude,
it's Erev Shabbos.'

442
00:35:00,267 --> 00:35:02,019
- What?
- 'Erev Shabbos.'

443
00:35:02,102 --> 00:35:04,438
- 'I can't drive.'
- Man!

444
00:35:04,521 --> 00:35:07,191
'I'm not supposed
to pick up the phone

445
00:35:07,274 --> 00:35:10,027
- 'unless it's an emergency.'
- This is a fucking emergency!

446
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:12,571
'That's why
I picked up the phone.'

447
00:35:12,654 --> 00:35:15,782
Walter, you fuck,
we gotta go to Pasadena.

448
00:35:15,866 --> 00:35:18,035
Pick me up
or I'm off the bowling team.

449
00:35:34,426 --> 00:35:37,262
Get out of that
fucking car, man.

450
00:35:37,346 --> 00:35:40,057
Get out of that fucking car!

451
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,643
Get the fuck out
of the car, man.

452
00:35:44,102 --> 00:35:46,313
Get out of the fucking...

453
00:35:46,396 --> 00:35:48,440
Who the fuck are you, man?

454
00:35:48,524 --> 00:35:52,402
Easy, man. Relax, man.
No physical harm intended.

455
00:35:52,486 --> 00:35:55,531
Who the fuck are you?
Why are you following me around?

456
00:35:55,614 --> 00:35:56,865
Come on, fuckhead.

457
00:35:56,949 --> 00:35:59,159
Relax, man.
I'm a brother Seamus.

458
00:35:59,243 --> 00:36:01,537
Brother Seamus?

459
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:04,164
Like an Irish monk?

460
00:36:04,248 --> 00:36:06,917
What the fuck are you
talking about?

461
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,754
My name is Da Fino. I'm a
private snoop, like you, man.

462
00:36:10,838 --> 00:36:13,715
- What?
- A dick, man.

463
00:36:13,799 --> 00:36:17,177
Let me tell you something.
I dig your work.

464
00:36:17,261 --> 00:36:19,221
Playing one side
against the other.

465
00:36:19,304 --> 00:36:21,765
In bed with everybody.
Fabulous stuff.

466
00:36:21,849 --> 00:36:23,308
I'm not! Fuck it.

467
00:36:23,392 --> 00:36:26,144
Just stay away
from my lady friend.

468
00:36:26,228 --> 00:36:28,730
I'm not messing
with your special lady.

469
00:36:28,814 --> 00:36:30,691
She's not my special lady.

470
00:36:30,774 --> 00:36:32,860
I'm just helping her conceive.

471
00:36:32,943 --> 00:36:35,362
- I'm not...
- Who are you working for?

472
00:36:35,445 --> 00:36:38,866
Lebowski? Jackie Treehorn?

473
00:36:38,991 --> 00:36:40,742
The Knutsens.

474
00:36:40,826 --> 00:36:45,122
The... who the fuck
are the Knutsens?

475
00:36:45,205 --> 00:36:48,709
The Knutsens.
It's a wandering... daughter job.

476
00:36:49,668 --> 00:36:52,588
Bunny Lebowski, man.

477
00:36:52,671 --> 00:36:55,132
Her real name is Fawn Knutsen.

478
00:36:55,215 --> 00:36:58,468
Her parents want her back.

479
00:36:58,552 --> 00:37:00,971
Jesus fucking Christ.

480
00:37:01,054 --> 00:37:03,223
Crazy, huh? Ran away
about a year ago.

481
00:37:03,307 --> 00:37:07,102
The Knutsens told me to
show her this when I found her.

482
00:37:07,186 --> 00:37:11,231
It's the family farm
outside of Moorhead, Minnesota.

483
00:37:11,315 --> 00:37:14,276
They think it'll
make her homesick.

484
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:18,614
How are you gonna keep 'em down
once they've seen Karl Hungus?

485
00:37:18,697 --> 00:37:21,366
- She's been kidnapped, Da Fino.
- Oh, man.

486
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:23,368
Maybe not, but she's not around.

487
00:37:23,452 --> 00:37:28,081
Hey, maybe you and me
could pool our resources.

488
00:37:28,165 --> 00:37:32,252
Trade information.
Professional courtesy.

489
00:37:32,336 --> 00:37:34,463
Compeers, you know what I mean?

490
00:37:34,546 --> 00:37:36,715
Yeah, yeah, I get it.
Fuck off, Da Fino.

491
00:37:36,798 --> 00:37:39,051
And stay away from my special...

492
00:37:39,134 --> 00:37:41,970
from my fucking
lady friend, man.

493
00:37:43,972 --> 00:37:46,558
Ze lingonberry pancakes.

494
00:37:50,687 --> 00:37:52,773
Lingonberry pancakes.

495
00:37:56,443 --> 00:37:58,821
Sree pigs in blanket.

496
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:06,912
She has lingonberry pancakes.

497
00:38:14,795 --> 00:38:17,256
We totally fucked it up, man.

498
00:38:17,339 --> 00:38:21,009
We fucked up his payoff,
we pissed off the kidnappers,

499
00:38:21,093 --> 00:38:24,972
and Lebowski, he yelled at me
but he didn't do anything, huh?

500
00:38:25,055 --> 00:38:27,766
Well, sometimes
it's a cathartic...

501
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:29,935
If he knows I'm a fuck... up,

502
00:38:30,018 --> 00:38:32,938
why does he ask me
to get his wife back?

503
00:38:33,021 --> 00:38:35,566
Because he doesn't
want her back.

504
00:38:35,649 --> 00:38:38,819
He's had enough.
He no longer digs her.

505
00:38:38,902 --> 00:38:41,905
But then,
why doesn't he give a shit

506
00:38:41,989 --> 00:38:43,824
about his million bucks?

507
00:38:43,907 --> 00:38:46,910
I mean, he knows we never
handed off his briefcase,

508
00:38:46,994 --> 00:38:48,745
but he never asked for it back.

509
00:38:48,829 --> 00:38:52,124
The million bucks was
never in the briefcase.

510
00:38:52,207 --> 00:38:55,544
The briefcase was
fucking empty, man.

511
00:38:55,627 --> 00:38:58,755
The asshole was hoping
that they would kill her.

512
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:01,592
You threw out a ringer
for a ringer.

513
00:39:01,675 --> 00:39:03,969
How does
this add up to an emergency?

514
00:39:04,052 --> 00:39:05,554
Huh?

515
00:39:05,637 --> 00:39:08,223
I see what you're
getting at, Dude,

516
00:39:08,307 --> 00:39:11,143
he kept the money.
My point is...

517
00:39:11,226 --> 00:39:15,898
here we are, it's Shabbos,
which I'm allowed to break

518
00:39:15,981 --> 00:39:18,901
only if it's a matter
of life or death.

519
00:39:18,984 --> 00:39:21,320
Come off it.
You're not even fucking Jewish.

520
00:39:21,403 --> 00:39:23,864
What the fuck
are you talking about?

521
00:39:23,947 --> 00:39:25,949
You're fucking Polish... Catholic.

522
00:39:26,033 --> 00:39:28,452
I converted when I married
Cynthia. Come on.

523
00:39:28,535 --> 00:39:31,163
- Yeah, yeah.
- You know this.

524
00:39:31,246 --> 00:39:33,749
Five years ago,
you were divorced.

525
00:39:33,832 --> 00:39:36,418
So when you get divorced,
you return your library card?

526
00:39:36,502 --> 00:39:39,213
You get a new licence?
You stop being Jewish?

527
00:39:39,296 --> 00:39:43,175
- This is the driveway.
- I'm Jewish as fucking Tevyé.

528
00:39:43,258 --> 00:39:46,929
Man, it's all a part
of your sick Cynthia thing.

529
00:39:47,012 --> 00:39:50,891
Taking care of her fucking dog.
Going to her fucking synagogue.

530
00:39:50,974 --> 00:39:52,518
You're living in the past.

531
00:39:52,601 --> 00:39:54,520
3,000 years
of beautiful tradition

532
00:39:54,603 --> 00:39:56,480
from Moses to Sandy Koufax,

533
00:39:56,563 --> 00:40:01,443
damn right I'm living
in the fucking past! I... Jesus.

534
00:40:01,527 --> 00:40:04,029
What the hell happened?

535
00:40:23,924 --> 00:40:25,676
Where was she, man?

536
00:40:25,759 --> 00:40:27,761
Visiting friends
in Palm Springs.

537
00:40:27,845 --> 00:40:30,055
She just left.
Never bothered to tell us.

538
00:40:30,138 --> 00:40:32,891
I guess the nihilist
knew where she was.

539
00:40:32,975 --> 00:40:34,768
She never
even kidnapped herself.

540
00:40:34,852 --> 00:40:38,814
- Who is this gentleman, Dude?
- Who am I? A fucking veteran.

541
00:40:38,897 --> 00:40:41,650
You shouldn't go in, Dude.
He's very angry.

542
00:40:44,444 --> 00:40:46,488
So, man...

543
00:40:46,572 --> 00:40:50,117
So, she's back,
no thanks to you.

544
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,078
- Where's the fucking money?
- A million bucks

545
00:40:53,162 --> 00:40:57,082
from fucking needy little
urban achievers! You are scum!

546
00:40:57,166 --> 00:40:59,543
- Who the hell is he?
- Who am I?

547
00:40:59,626 --> 00:41:02,921
I'm the guy that's gonna kick
your goldbricking ass!

548
00:41:03,005 --> 00:41:06,717
The briefcase was empty.
You kept the money for yourself.

549
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,802
You have your story,
I have mine.

550
00:41:08,886 --> 00:41:11,638
I entrusted the money
to you, and you stole it.

551
00:41:11,722 --> 00:41:15,142
As if we would ever
take your bullshit money!

552
00:41:15,225 --> 00:41:18,896
You thought Bunny had been
kidnapped, and you were glad.

553
00:41:18,979 --> 00:41:21,231
You could make
some money disappear.

554
00:41:21,315 --> 00:41:23,984
You needed was a sap
to pin it on.

555
00:41:24,067 --> 00:41:27,946
You just met me.
You... human paraquat!

556
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:30,240
You figured,
"Oh, here's a loser."

557
00:41:30,324 --> 00:41:33,660
Somebody the square community
won't give a shit about.

558
00:41:33,744 --> 00:41:38,123
- Well, aren't you?
- Well, yeah, but...

559
00:41:39,416 --> 00:41:40,876
Get out, both of you.

560
00:41:40,959 --> 00:41:44,379
Look at that phony.
Pretending to be a millionaire.

561
00:41:44,463 --> 00:41:46,381
Out of this house now, you bums!

562
00:41:46,465 --> 00:41:48,175
Let me tell you something.

563
00:41:48,258 --> 00:41:50,636
I've seen
a lot of spinals, Dude,

564
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:54,223
and this guy's a fake.
A fucking goldbricker.

565
00:41:54,306 --> 00:41:57,601
- Stay away from me!
- This guy fucking walks.

566
00:41:57,684 --> 00:42:00,646
- I've never been more certain.
- Stay away!

567
00:42:00,729 --> 00:42:04,066
Walter, for Christ's sake,
man, he's a cripple.

568
00:42:04,149 --> 00:42:06,068
Get away from me!

569
00:42:07,903 --> 00:42:11,198
- Put him down, man!
- Yeah, I'll put him down!

570
00:42:11,281 --> 00:42:13,408
Rauss! Achtung, baby!

571
00:42:29,591 --> 00:42:32,845
Come on, help me
put him back in his chair.

572
00:42:52,906 --> 00:42:55,284
Sure, you'll see
some tank battles.

573
00:42:55,367 --> 00:42:58,078
Fighting in desert
is very different

574
00:42:58,162 --> 00:43:02,249
from fighting in jungle.
'Nam was a foot soldier's war,

575
00:43:02,332 --> 00:43:06,420
whereas this thing should,
you know, be a piece of cake.

576
00:43:06,503 --> 00:43:10,340
I mean, I had an M16 Jacko,
not an Abrams fucking tank.

577
00:43:10,424 --> 00:43:12,843
Me and Charlie,
eyeball to eyeball.

578
00:43:12,926 --> 00:43:15,679
- Yeah.
- That's fuckin' combat.

579
00:43:15,762 --> 00:43:18,432
The man in
the black pyjamas, Dude.

580
00:43:18,515 --> 00:43:20,934
Worthy fuckin' adversary.

581
00:43:21,018 --> 00:43:24,563
- Who's in pyjamas, Walter?
- Shut the fuck up, Donny.

582
00:43:24,646 --> 00:43:26,607
Whereas, what we have here...

583
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:29,151
Fig... eaters wearing
towels on their heads,

584
00:43:29,234 --> 00:43:31,528
trying to find reverse
on a Soviet tank.

585
00:43:31,612 --> 00:43:33,906
- This... this is not a worthy...
- Hey!

586
00:43:33,989 --> 00:43:36,325
What's this day... of... rest shit?

587
00:43:36,408 --> 00:43:39,369
What's this bullshit?!
I don't fuckin' care!

588
00:43:39,453 --> 00:43:43,123
It don't matter to Jesus.
But you not fooling me, man.

589
00:43:43,207 --> 00:43:45,417
You might fool
the league office,

590
00:43:45,501 --> 00:43:48,045
but you don't fool Jesus.

591
00:43:48,128 --> 00:43:50,756
It's bush league
psyche... out stuff.

592
00:43:50,839 --> 00:43:53,217
Laughable, man.

593
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:56,553
I would have fucked you
in the ass Saturday.

594
00:43:56,637 --> 00:44:00,641
I'll fuck you in the ass
next Wednesday instead.

595
00:44:00,724 --> 00:44:04,853
Whoo! You got a date
Wednesday, baby.

596
00:44:08,357 --> 00:44:10,526
He's cracking.

597
00:44:10,984 --> 00:44:12,528
The whole concept of Asia.

598
00:44:12,611 --> 00:44:14,863
Many learned men
have disputed this,

599
00:44:14,947 --> 00:44:18,200
but in the 14th Century,
the Rabahm, he...

600
00:44:26,959 --> 00:44:29,253
Well, they finally did it.

601
00:44:29,336 --> 00:44:31,547
They killed my fucking car.

602
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:35,425
We want ze money, Lebowski.

603
00:44:35,509 --> 00:44:37,761
Ja, otherwise, we kill ze girl.

604
00:44:37,845 --> 00:44:41,348
Ja, it seems you have
forgotten our little deal.

605
00:44:41,431 --> 00:44:44,268
You don't have
the fucking girl, dipshit.

606
00:44:44,351 --> 00:44:47,020
< We know you never did.

607
00:44:47,104 --> 00:44:48,772
Are these the Nazis?

608
00:44:48,856 --> 00:44:51,066
No, nihilists.
Nothing to be afraid of.

609
00:44:52,985 --> 00:44:56,572
Ve don't care. Ve still
want the money, Lebowski,

610
00:44:56,655 --> 00:44:58,824
or we'll fuck you up.

611
00:44:58,907 --> 00:45:01,618
Fuck you.
Fuck the three of yous.

612
00:45:01,702 --> 00:45:05,330
No, without a hostage,
there is no ransom.

613
00:45:05,414 --> 00:45:08,625
That's what ransom is.
Those are the fucking rules.

614
00:45:08,709 --> 00:45:10,961
His girlfriend gave up her toe.

615
00:45:11,044 --> 00:45:13,672
She zought
we'd be getting $1 million.

616
00:45:13,755 --> 00:45:15,007
It's not fair.

617
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:18,177
Fair? Who's the fucking
nihilist around here,

618
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:20,345
you bunch of fucking crybabies.

619
00:45:20,429 --> 00:45:24,516
Cool it, Walter. Hey, look, pal,
there never was any money.

620
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,935
The big Lebowski
gave me an empty briefcase,

621
00:45:27,019 --> 00:45:28,854
so take it up with him, man.

622
00:45:28,937 --> 00:45:31,356
I would like my undies back.

623
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,693
- Are these guys gonna hurt us?
- No, these men are cowards.

624
00:45:34,776 --> 00:45:38,113
OK, so we take
ze money you have on you

625
00:45:38,197 --> 00:45:40,157
and we calls it even.

626
00:45:40,949 --> 00:45:42,784
Fuck you.

627
00:45:42,868 --> 00:45:46,330
No, Walter, come on.
We're ending this cheap, man.

628
00:45:46,413 --> 00:45:49,291
- No, what's mine is mine.
- Come on, Walter.

629
00:45:49,374 --> 00:45:53,462
- No funny stuff.
- All right, I got...

630
00:45:53,545 --> 00:45:56,507
- uh, 4 bucks, almost 5.
- I got $18.

631
00:45:56,590 --> 00:45:58,592
What's mine is mine.

632
00:45:58,675 --> 00:46:01,303
We fuck you up, man.
We takes the money.

633
00:46:01,386 --> 00:46:03,805
Come and get it.

634
00:46:04,431 --> 00:46:06,725
We fuck you up.

635
00:46:06,808 --> 00:46:08,769
Show me what you got, nihilist.

636
00:46:08,852 --> 00:46:10,354
I fuck you.

637
00:46:10,437 --> 00:46:12,022
Come on, he's got a sword.

638
00:46:12,105 --> 00:46:13,941
Dipshit with a nine... toed woman.

639
00:46:14,024 --> 00:46:17,236
Fuck you! Fuck you!

640
00:46:17,319 --> 00:46:18,946
I fuck you, I!

641
00:46:24,284 --> 00:46:26,370
Take it easy, man.
Here's the $4.

642
00:46:32,751 --> 00:46:34,753
I got a fucking ball, man.

643
00:46:40,467 --> 00:46:42,594
Anti... Semite!

644
00:46:42,678 --> 00:46:44,847
I fuck you in ze ass.

645
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:48,433
I fuck you! I fuck you!

646
00:46:48,517 --> 00:46:50,143
I fuck you! I fuck you!

647
00:46:56,608 --> 00:46:58,735
We got a man down, Dude.

648
00:47:02,156 --> 00:47:04,366
God, they shot him, man.

649
00:47:04,449 --> 00:47:06,410
- No, Dude.
- They shot Donny?

650
00:47:06,493 --> 00:47:09,663
There weren't any shots fired.
It's a heart attack.

651
00:47:09,746 --> 00:47:12,124
Call the medics, Dude.

652
00:47:12,207 --> 00:47:15,752
I'd go myself, but I'm
pumping blood. Might pass out.

653
00:47:15,836 --> 00:47:19,464
Rest easy, good buddy,
you're doing fine.

654
00:47:19,548 --> 00:47:21,717
We got help choppering in.

655
00:47:48,452 --> 00:47:51,246
Hello, gentlemen.
You are the bereaved?

656
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:53,165
Yeah, man.

657
00:47:53,248 --> 00:47:55,292
Francis Donnelly.
Pleased to meet you.

658
00:47:55,375 --> 00:47:56,919
Jeff Lebowski.

659
00:47:57,002 --> 00:47:58,587
Walter Sobchak.

660
00:47:58,670 --> 00:48:01,340
The Dude, actually, is, uh...

661
00:48:01,423 --> 00:48:04,051
- Excuse me?
- Oh, nothing.

662
00:48:04,134 --> 00:48:09,848
Yes, I understand
you're taking away the remains.

663
00:48:09,932 --> 00:48:11,475
Yeah.

664
00:48:11,558 --> 00:48:14,061
We have the urn.

665
00:48:14,144 --> 00:48:17,481
I assume this is credit card.

666
00:48:18,607 --> 00:48:20,067
Yeah.

667
00:48:34,289 --> 00:48:36,583
What's this?

668
00:48:36,667 --> 00:48:38,544
That's for the urn.

669
00:48:38,627 --> 00:48:41,046
Don't need it.
We're scattering the ashes.

670
00:48:41,129 --> 00:48:43,173
Yes, so we were informed.

671
00:48:43,257 --> 00:48:45,634
However, we must, of course,

672
00:48:45,717 --> 00:48:48,929
transmit the remains
to you in a receptacle.

673
00:48:50,264 --> 00:48:52,266
This is $180.

674
00:48:52,349 --> 00:48:56,270
It is our most...
modestly priced receptacle.

675
00:48:56,353 --> 00:48:58,814
- Can we just, uh...
- $180?

676
00:48:58,897 --> 00:49:02,860
- They range up to 3,000.
- Uh, we're, uh, ahem...

677
00:49:02,943 --> 00:49:05,070
Can't we just
rent it from you?

678
00:49:05,154 --> 00:49:07,906
Sir, this is a mortuary,
not a rental house.

679
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:09,533
We're scattering the ashes!

680
00:49:09,616 --> 00:49:12,703
Just because we're bereaved,
doesn't make us saps!

681
00:49:12,786 --> 00:49:15,539
Sir, please, lower your voices.

682
00:49:15,622 --> 00:49:17,666
Man, don't you have, you know,

683
00:49:17,749 --> 00:49:21,503
something else we could
put him in, you know?

684
00:49:21,587 --> 00:49:24,173
That is our most...
modestly priced receptacle.

685
00:49:24,256 --> 00:49:25,799
Goddamn it!

686
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:29,761
Is there a Ralph's around here?

687
00:49:56,413 --> 00:50:00,125
Donny was a good bowler
and a good man.

688
00:50:00,209 --> 00:50:02,503
He was one of us.

689
00:50:02,586 --> 00:50:06,924
He was a man who loved
the outdoors... and bowling.

690
00:50:07,007 --> 00:50:09,259
As a surfer,
he explored the beaches

691
00:50:09,343 --> 00:50:11,220
of Southern California,

692
00:50:11,303 --> 00:50:16,517
from La Jolla to Leo Carrillo
and up to Pismo.

693
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:21,522
He died... he died as so
many men of his generation,

694
00:50:21,605 --> 00:50:23,398
before his time.

695
00:50:23,482 --> 00:50:26,610
In your wisdom, Lord,
you took him.

696
00:50:26,693 --> 00:50:30,197
As you took so many bright,
flowering young men

697
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:35,702
at Khe Sanh, at Lan Doc,
and Hill 364.

698
00:50:35,786 --> 00:50:38,163
These young men
gave their lives.

699
00:50:38,247 --> 00:50:40,457
So did Donny.

700
00:50:42,209 --> 00:50:45,212
Donny who loved bowling.

701
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:49,466
And so...

702
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:52,427
Theodore Donald Karabotsos,

703
00:50:52,511 --> 00:50:57,224
in accordance
with what we think

704
00:50:57,307 --> 00:50:59,643
your dying wishes
might well have been,

705
00:50:59,726 --> 00:51:03,605
we commit your final,
mortal remains

706
00:51:03,689 --> 00:51:07,568
to the bosom
of the Pacific Ocean,

707
00:51:07,651 --> 00:51:10,529
which you loved so well.

708
00:51:12,322 --> 00:51:14,283
Goodnight, sweet prince.

709
00:51:28,547 --> 00:51:30,757
Shit.

710
00:51:32,551 --> 00:51:35,512
Oh, shit, Dude, I'm sorry.

711
00:51:36,221 --> 00:51:39,766
- Goddamn wind.
- Goddamn it, Walter.

712
00:51:39,850 --> 00:51:42,269
- You fucking asshole!
- Dude, I'm sorry.

713
00:51:42,352 --> 00:51:44,813
Everything's
a fucking travesty with you.

714
00:51:44,897 --> 00:51:46,607
Sorry. It was an accident.

715
00:51:46,690 --> 00:51:48,442
What was that shit
about Vietnam?

716
00:51:48,525 --> 00:51:51,904
What does anything
have to do with Vietnam?

717
00:51:51,987 --> 00:51:53,822
What the fuck
were you talking about?

718
00:51:53,906 --> 00:51:55,866
Dude, I'm sorry.

719
00:51:57,743 --> 00:51:59,995
Fuckin'...

720
00:52:05,626 --> 00:52:07,878
Fuck, Walter.

721
00:52:08,504 --> 00:52:13,383
Come on, Dude.
Hey, fuck it, man.

722
00:52:17,095 --> 00:52:19,640
Let's go bowling.

723
00:53:13,152 --> 00:53:15,112
Two oat sodas, Gary.

724
00:53:15,195 --> 00:53:17,656
- Good luck tomorrow.
- Yeah, thanks, man.

725
00:53:17,739 --> 00:53:19,992
I'm sorry to hear about Donny.

726
00:53:20,075 --> 00:53:23,453
Oh, well, yeah, you know,

727
00:53:23,537 --> 00:53:26,999
sometimes you eat the bar
and sometimes, you know...

728
00:53:27,082 --> 00:53:29,001
Hey, man!

729
00:53:29,084 --> 00:53:31,044
Howdy doo, Dude.

730
00:53:31,128 --> 00:53:33,589
I wondered if I'd see you again.

731
00:53:33,672 --> 00:53:37,092
I wouldn't miss the semis.
How have things been going?

732
00:53:37,176 --> 00:53:40,095
Strikes and gutters,
ups and downs.

733
00:53:40,179 --> 00:53:43,599
- Sure. I gotcha.
- Yeah.

734
00:53:43,682 --> 00:53:45,601
Thanks, Gary.

735
00:53:45,684 --> 00:53:48,353
Well, take care, man.
Gotta get back.

736
00:53:48,437 --> 00:53:51,064
- Sure. Take it easy, Dude.
- Oh, yeah.

737
00:53:51,148 --> 00:53:53,233
I know that you will.

738
00:53:53,317 --> 00:53:57,321
Yeah, well, the Dude abides.

739
00:54:03,035 --> 00:54:06,163
The Dude abides.

740
00:54:08,957 --> 00:54:13,629
I don't know about you,
but I take comfort in that.

741
00:54:13,712 --> 00:54:17,716
It's good knowing
he's out there, the Dude.

742
00:54:17,799 --> 00:54:20,886
Takin' her easy
for all us sinners.

743
00:54:20,969 --> 00:54:23,138
Shoosh.

744
00:54:23,222 --> 00:54:26,517
I sure hope he makes the finals.

745
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:31,355
Well, that about does her.
Wraps her all up.

746
00:54:31,438 --> 00:54:36,276
Things seem to have worked out
good for the Dude and Walter.

747
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:40,072
It was a pretty good story,
don't you think?

748
00:54:40,155 --> 00:54:43,242
Made me laugh to beat the band.

749
00:54:43,325 --> 00:54:45,619
Parts, anyway.

750
00:54:45,702 --> 00:54:49,122
I didn't like seeing Donny go.

751
00:54:49,206 --> 00:54:51,875
But then I happen to know

752
00:54:51,959 --> 00:54:55,462
that there's
a little Lebowski on the way.

753
00:54:55,546 --> 00:54:59,383
I guess that's how
the whole darn human comedy

754
00:54:59,466 --> 00:55:02,553
keeps perpetuating itself

755
00:55:02,636 --> 00:55:05,430
down through the generations.

756
00:55:05,514 --> 00:55:07,516
Westward the wagons,

757
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:10,686
across the sands
of time until we...

758
00:55:10,769 --> 00:55:12,813
Oh, look at me.

759
00:55:12,896 --> 00:55:15,607
I'm ramblin' again.

760
00:55:15,691 --> 00:55:18,360
Well, I hope you folks
enjoyed yourselves.

761
00:55:18,443 --> 00:55:21,446
Catch ya later on
down the trail.

762
00:55:21,530 --> 00:55:25,868
Say, friend, you got any more
of that good Sarsaparilla?

763
01:00:03,437 --> 01:00:08,859
