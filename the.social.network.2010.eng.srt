<i>Did you know there are more people</i>
<i>with genius IQs living in China</i>

2
00:00:19,086 --> 00:00:21,145
<i>than there are people of any kind</i>
<i>living in the United States?</i>

3
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:23,018
<i>- That can't possibly be true.</i>
<i>- It is.</i>

4
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:24,148
<i>What would account for that?</i>

5
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:27,216
Well, first, an awful lot of people
live in China, but here's my question.

6
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:29,420
How do you distinguish yourself
in a population of people

7
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,361
who all got 1600 on their SATs?

8
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:33,228
- I didn't know they take SATs in China.
- They don't.

9
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,426
I wasn't talking about China anymore,
I was talking about me.

10
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:37,003
You got a 1600?

11
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,901
Yes. I could sing in an a cappella group,
but I can't sing.

12
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:40,200
Does that mean you actually
got nothing wrong?

13
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:42,572
I could row crew or invent a $25 PC.

14
00:00:42,676 --> 00:00:43,904
Or you could get into a final club.

15
00:00:44,011 --> 00:00:45,342
Or I get into a final club.

16
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:46,840
You know, from a woman's perspective,

17
00:00:46,914 --> 00:00:48,779
sometimes not singing in
an a cappella group is a good thing.

18
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:49,906
This is serious.

19
00:00:50,017 --> 00:00:51,450
On the other hand,
I do like guys who row crew.

20
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:53,417
Well, I can't do that.

21
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,085
I was kidding.

22
00:00:55,188 --> 00:00:56,348
And, yes, I got nothing wrong on the test.

23
00:00:56,423 --> 00:00:58,220
- Have you ever tried?
- I'm trying right now.

24
00:00:58,292 --> 00:01:00,123
- To row crew?
- To get into a final club.

25
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:02,457
To row crew? No.
Are you, like, whatever, delusional?

26
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:04,531
Maybe it's just sometimes
you say two things at once.

27
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:06,122
I'm not sure which one
I'm supposed to be aiming at.

28
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:08,133
But you've seen guys who row crew, right?

29
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:09,259
No.

30
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:11,428
Okay, well, they're bigger than me.
They're world-class athletes.

31
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:12,971
And a second ago,
you said you like guys who row crew

32
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,097
so I assumed you had met one.

33
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:18,200
I guess I just meant I like the idea of it.
You know, the way a girl likes cowboys.

34
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:19,769
Okay.

35
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:21,305
Should we get something to eat?

36
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:23,212
Would you like to talk
about something else?

37
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:26,714
No. It's just since the beginning of
the conversation about finals club,

38
00:01:26,787 --> 00:01:28,652
I think I may have missed a birthday.

39
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:32,619
There are realy more people in China with
genius IQs than the entire population...

40
00:01:32,726 --> 00:01:36,059
The Phoenix is the most diverse.
The Fly Club... Roosevelt punched the Porc.

41
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:37,221
Which one?

42
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:38,787
The Porcellian, the Porc.
It's the best of the best.

43
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:40,628
- Which Roosevelt?
- Theodore.

44
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:44,060
Is it true that they send a bus around
to pick up girls

45
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:45,604
who want to party with
the next Fed chairman?

46
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:48,402
So you can see why
it's so important to get in.

47
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:49,999
Okay, well, which is the easiest to get into?

48
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:55,413
- Why would you ask me that?
- I was just asking.

49
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:57,643
None of them. That's the point.

50
00:01:57,751 --> 00:02:00,652
My friend Eduardo made $300,000
betting oil futures one summer

51
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:02,085
and Eduardo won't come close to getting in.

52
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:04,123
The ability to make money doesn't
impress anybody around here.

53
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:07,456
Must be nice.
He made $300,000 in a summer?

54
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:09,859
- He likes meteorology.
- You said it was oil futures.

55
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,158
You can read the weather,
you can predict the price of heating oil.

56
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:13,323
I think you asked me that

57
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:15,196
because you think
the final club that's easiest to get into

58
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:16,530
is the one where I'll have the best chance.

59
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,969
I...What?

60
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,597
You asked me which one was
the easiest to get into

61
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:23,165
because you think that that's the one
where I'll have the best chance.

62
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:25,767
The one that's the easiest to get into
would be the one

63
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:27,006
where anybody has the best chance.

64
00:02:27,114 --> 00:02:28,672
You didn't ask me which one
was the best one,

65
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:30,215
you asked me which one
was the easiest one.

66
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:33,885
I was honestly just asking, okay?
I was just asking to ask.

67
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,353
- Mark, I'm not speaking in code.
- Erica.

68
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,790
You're obsessed with finals clubs.

69
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:41,225
You have finals clubs OCD
and you need to see someone about it

70
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:42,989
who will prescribe you
some sort of medication.

71
00:02:43,063 --> 00:02:45,554
You don't care if the side effects
may include blindness.

72
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:48,361
Final clubs. Not "finals clubs."

73
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,161
And there's a difference between
being obsessed and being motivated.

74
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,072
Yes. There is.

75
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,836
Well, you do.
That was cryptic, so you do speak in code.

76
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,172
I didn't mean to be cryptic.

77
00:02:58,245 --> 00:03:00,008
I'm just saying I need to do
something substantial

78
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,911
in orderto get the attention of the clubs.

79
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,744
- Why?
- Because they're exclusive.

80
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:06,247
And fun, and they lead to a better life.

81
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:07,910
Teddy Roosevelt didn't get elected president

82
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,921
because he was a member
of the Phoenix Club.

83
00:03:10,057 --> 00:03:12,252
He was a memberof the Porcellian,
and yes, he did.

84
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:15,725
Well, why don't you just concentrate
on being the best you you can be?

85
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:17,352
Did you really just say that?

86
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:18,921
I was kidding.

87
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,693
Just because something's trite
doesn't make it less true.

88
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:21,859
I wanna try to be straightforward with you

89
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:24,199
and tell you I think you might
want to be a little more supportive.

90
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:27,866
If I get in, I will be taking you
to the events and the gatherings,

91
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:31,104
and you'll be meeting a lot of people
you wouldn't normally get to meet.

92
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:33,712
You would do that for me?

93
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:35,746
We're dating.

94
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:37,211
Okay.

95
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:40,443
Well, I wanna try and be
straightforward with you

96
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:42,384
and let you know that we're not anymore.

97
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:44,947
- What do you mean?
- We're not dating anymore. I'm sorry.

98
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:47,117
- Is this a joke?
- No, it's not.

99
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,216
You're breaking up with me?

100
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:49,557
You're gonna introduce me to people

101
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:51,290
I wouldn't normally
have the chance to meet?

102
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:53,228
What the... What is that supposed to mean?

103
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,562
- Wait, settle down.
- What is it supposed to mean?

104
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:56,465
Erica, the reason we're able to sit here
and drink right now

105
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:58,298
is 'cause you used to sleep
with the door guy.

106
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:03,069
"The door guy'? His name is Bobby.
I have not slept with the door guy.

107
00:04:03,143 --> 00:04:07,580
The door guy is a friend of mine,
and he's a perfectly good class of people.

108
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:10,138
And what part of Long Island
are you from, Wimbledon?

109
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:12,478
- Wait. Wait, wait.
- I'm going back to my dorm.

110
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:13,916
- Is this real?
- Yes.

111
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:15,978
- Then wait, I apologize, okay?
- I have to go study.

112
00:04:16,123 --> 00:04:17,420
- Erica?
- Yes?

113
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:19,755
- I'm sorry, I mean it.
- I appreciate that, but I have to go study.

114
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:22,090
Come on, you don't have to study.
Let's just talk.

115
00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:23,424
- I can't.
- Why?

116
00:04:23,497 --> 00:04:26,432
Because it is exhausting.
Dating you is like dating a StairMaster.

117
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,661
All I meant is that you're not likely to...
Currently...

118
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:29,928
I wasn't making a comment
on your appearance.

119
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:32,164
I was saying that you go to BU.
I was stating a fact, that's all,

120
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:33,329
and if it seemed rude, then I apologize.

121
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,771
- I have to go study.
- You don't have to study.

122
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:36,172
Why do you keep saying
I don't have to study?

123
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,107
'Cause you go to BU.

124
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,647
Do you want to get some food?

125
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:45,182
I am sorry you are not sufficiently
impressed with my education.

126
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:47,176
And I'm sorry I don't have a rowboat,
so we're even.

127
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,016
- I think we should just be friends.
- I don't want friends.

128
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:51,181
I was just being polite.

129
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,451
I have no intention
of being friends with you.

130
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:54,619
I'm under some pressure right now
from my OS class

131
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:57,288
and if we could just order some food,
I think we should...

132
00:04:57,664 --> 00:05:02,033
Okay, you are probably going to be
a very successful computer person.

133
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:05,127
But you're gonna go through life
thinking that girls don't like you

134
00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:06,866
because you're a nerd.

135
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:10,542
And I want you to know from the bottom
of my heart that that won't be true.

136
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:14,673
lt'll be because you're an asshole.

<i>Erica Albright's a bitch.</i>

<i>Do you think that's because her family</i>

147
00:08:57,337 --> 00:08:59,237
<i>So what if it's not even 10:00 p.m.</i>
<i>and it's a Tuesday night?</i>

148
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:00,363
Billy.

149
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,203
<i>The Kirkland facebook</i>
<i>is open on my desktop,</i>

150
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:04,937
<i>and some of these people have</i>
<i>pretty horrendous facebook pics</i>.

151
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:08,607
<i>Billy Olson's sitting here and had</i>
<i>the idea of putting some of the pictures</i>

152
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:11,945
<i>next to pictures of farm animals</i>
<i>and have people vote on who's hotter</i>.

153
00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:13,609
<i>Good call, Mr. Olson</i>.

154
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:23,021
<i>Yeah, it's on.</i>
<i>I'm not gonna do the farm animals,</i>

155
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:24,927
<i>but I like the idea of comparing</i>
<i>two people together</i>.

156
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:26,521
<i>It gives the whole thing a very "Turing" feel</i>

157
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:28,567
<i>since people's ratings of the pictures</i>
<i>will be more implicit</i>

158
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:31,195
<i>than, say, choosing a number to</i>
<i>represent each person's hotness,</i>

159
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:32,965
<i>like they do on hotornot.com.</i>

160
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:35,597
<i>The first thing we're going to need</i>
<i>is a lot of pictures</i>.

161
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,903
<i>Unfortunately, Harvard doesn't keep</i>
<i>a public centralized facebook,</i>

162
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:39,035
<i>so I'm going to have to get all the images</i>

163
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:40,772
<i>from the individual houses</i>
<i>that people are in</i>.

164
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:43,612
<i>Let the hacking begin.</i>

165
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:00,655
<i>First up is Kirkland.</i>

166
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,769
<i>They keep everything open and allow</i>
<i>indexes in their Apache configuration</i>.

167
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:08,399
<i>So a little Wget magic is all that's necessary</i>
<i>to download the entire Kirkland facebook.</i>

168
00:10:08,508 --> 00:10:09,497
<i>Kids' stuff.</i>

169
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:28,015
<i>Next is Eliot.</i>

170
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:30,254
<i>They're also open,</i>
<i>but with no indexes on Apache</i>.

171
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:31,352
<i>I can run an empty search</i>

172
00:10:31,498 --> 00:10:33,830
<i>and it returns all of the images</i>
<i>in the database in a single page</i>.

173
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:37,198
<i>And I can save the page and Mozilla</i>
<i>will save all the images for me</i>.

174
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:38,929
<i>Excellent. Moving right along.</i>

175
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:41,465
Excuse me! Everybody!

176
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:44,977
You are at one of the oldest,
one of the most exclusive clubs,

177
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:47,842
not just at Harvard, but in the world.

178
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:49,203
And I want to welcome you all

179
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:52,716
to Phoenix Club's first party
of the fall semester!

180
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:02,521
<i>Lowell has some security.</i>
<i>They require a user name/password combo,</i>

181
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:05,792
<i>and I'm gonna go ahead and say they don't</i>
<i>have access to the main FAS user database,</i>

182
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:07,059
<i>so they have no way</i>
<i>of detecting an intrusion</i>.

183
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:12,000
<i>Adams has no security, but limits</i>
<i>the number of results to 20 a page</i>.

184
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:15,165
<i>All I need to do is break out the same script</i>
<i>I used on Lowell and we're set.</i>

185
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:18,734
<i>Quincy has no online facebook.</i>
<i>What a sham.</i>

186
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:20,136
<i>Nothing I can do about that.</i>

187
00:11:21,581 --> 00:11:22,639
<i>Dunster is intense.</i>

188
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:25,411
<i>Not only is there no public directory,</i>
<i>but there's no directory at all</i>.

189
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,542
<i>You have to do searches,</i>

190
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:29,213
<i>and if your search returns more</i>
<i>than 20 matches, nothing gets returned</i>.

191
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:31,552
<i>And once you do get results</i>,
<i>they don't link directly to the images</i>.

192
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:34,218
<i>They link to a PHP that redirects</i>
<i>or something. Weird</i>.

193
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:35,760
<i>This may be difficult. I'll come back later.</i>

194
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:37,659
- Hey, <i>Shark Week's</i> on.
- What?

195
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:40,391
- Great white, beautiful fish.
- Nice.

196
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,161
<i>Leverett is a little better.</i>
<i>They still make you search,</i>

197
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:45,362
<i>but you can do an empty search and get</i>
<i>links to pages with every student's picture</i>.

198
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:48,100
<i>It's slightly obnoxious that they</i>
<i>only let you view one picture at a time,</i>

199
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:51,075
<i>and there's no way I'm going to go</i>
<i>to 500 pages to download pics one at a time</i>.

200
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:54,544
<i>So it's definitely necessary to break out</i>
<i>Emacs and modify that Perl script.</i>

201
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:06,692
Here you go.

202
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:12,956
<i>Done.</i>

203
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:15,129
Hey, what's going on?

204
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:18,898
<i>Perfect timing. Eduardo's here</i>
<i>and he's going to have the key ingredient</i>.

205
00:12:18,972 --> 00:12:20,599
- Hey, Mark.
- Wardo.

206
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:22,698
You and Erica split up.

207
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:23,867
How did you know that?

208
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:25,467
It's on your blog.

209
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:28,106
- Yeah.
- Are you all right?

210
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:30,546
- I need you.
- I'm here for you.

211
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,650
No, I need the algorithm you use
to rank chess players.

212
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,982
- Are you okay?
- We're ranking girls.

213
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,381
- You mean other students.
- Yeah.

214
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:41,153
You think this is such a good idea?

215
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:42,759
- I need the algorithm.
- Mark...

216
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:44,660
I need the algorithm.

217
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:48,331
Give each girl a base rating of 1400.

218
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:52,894
At any given time Girl A has a rating R-a
and Girl B has a rating R-b.

219
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:55,736
When any two girls are matched up,
there's an expectation of which will win

220
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:56,934
based on their current rating, right?

221
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:00,502
Yeah. And those expectations
are expressed this way.

222
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,011
Let's write it.

223
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:18,624
One on the left.

224
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:20,429
The right.

225
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:21,932
Yeah, still the right.

226
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:23,832
- It works.
- Who should we send it to first?

227
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:24,960
- Dwyer.
- Neal.

228
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:28,132
- Who are you gonna send it to?
- Just a couple of people.

229
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:29,366
The question is,

230
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:32,042
who are they gonna send it to?

231
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:02,473
Hey, guys, check this out.

232
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:06,642
Someone go to the left. Dude, do left.

233
00:14:06,746 --> 00:14:09,237
Look at these girls. Right or left?

234
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,579
- Left is hot.
- Left? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

235
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,376
Right or left?

236
00:14:14,487 --> 00:14:16,250
That's my roommate.

237
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:18,256
- Oh, my God.
- The girl on the left.

238
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:21,351
This is pathetic.

239
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:22,485
Right.

240
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:23,755
Left.

241
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:25,422
- Left.
- Left?

242
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:27,863
Oh, shit.

243
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,032
Albright.

244
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,498
He blogged about you.

245
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:34,867
You don't wanna read it.

246
00:14:38,845 --> 00:14:40,005
Left.

247
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:41,572
Latina.

248
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:42,875
Erica.

249
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:45,207
Is this yours?

250
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:46,751
I stole it from a tranny.

251
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:48,878
Get the hell out of here!

252
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,546
- Left.
- One on the right.

253
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:53,114
Left.

254
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:02,293
Man, thats an awful lot of traffic.

255
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:06,728
You think maybe we shouldn't shut it down
before we get into trouble?

256
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:16,775
Hello?

257
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,916
Wait, wait, wait, wait. What?

258
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:22,879
At 4:00 in the morning?

259
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:26,083
Well, there's a very unusual amount
of traffic to the switch at Kirkland.

260
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:28,622
You're saying it's unusual
for 4:00 in the morning?

261
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:31,788
No, this'd be unusual
for halftime at the Super Bowl.

262
00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:33,830
All right.

263
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:38,127
I gotta go in.

264
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,265
What's going on?

265
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:42,967
Harvard's network is about to crash.

266
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:50,274
You don't think...

267
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:53,578
I do.

268
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,481
Go see if it's everybody's.

269
00:16:02,028 --> 00:16:03,427
I can't connect.

270
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:06,360
The network's down.

271
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:09,129
Unless it's a coincidence, I think this is us.

272
00:16:09,202 --> 00:16:10,669
It's not a coincidence.

273
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:12,627
Holy shit.

274
00:16:16,943 --> 00:16:18,467
So you were called in front of the Ad Board.

275
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:20,205
That's not what happened.

276
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:21,940
You weren't called in front
of the Administrative Board?

277
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:25,780
No, back. I mean back at the bar
with Erica Albright. She said all that?

278
00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:27,479
- Mark...
- That I said that stuff to her?

279
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:29,214
I was reading from the transcript
of her deposition.

280
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:30,983
Yeah, why would you even need
to depose her?

281
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:32,718
That's really for us to decide.

282
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:36,352
You think if I know she can make me
look like a jerk, I'll be more likely to settle.

283
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:37,861
Why don't we stretch our legs for a minute?

284
00:16:37,964 --> 00:16:39,693
Can we do that?
It's been almost three hours.

285
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:43,462
And frankly, you did spend an awful lot
of time embarrassing Mr. Zuckerberg

286
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:45,367
with the girl's testmony from the bar.

287
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:47,063
I'm not embarrassed,
she just made a lot of that up.

288
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,231
She was under oath.

289
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,707
Then I guess that would be the first time
somebody's lied under oath.

290
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:04,523
The site got 2,200 hits within two hours?

291
00:17:04,924 --> 00:17:05,982
Thousand.

292
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:07,218
What?

293
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,192
Twenty-two thousand.

294
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:13,590
Wow.

295
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:32,882
These guys are just freakin' fast.

296
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:41,022
Is there any way to make this a fair fight?

297
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:42,856
Jump out and swim.

298
00:17:43,296 --> 00:17:45,457
I think we'd have to jump out and drown.

299
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:48,591
Well, you could row forward
and I could row backward.

300
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:51,932
We're geneticaly identical.
Science says we'd stay in one place.

301
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:53,096
Just row the damn boat.

302
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:02,944
- You guys hear about this?
- What?

303
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:06,644
Two nights ago, a sophomore choked
the network from a aptop at Kirkland.

304
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,242
- Really?
- At 4:00 a.m.

305
00:18:08,788 --> 00:18:09,812
How?

306
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,948
He set up a website where you vote
on the hotness of female undergrads.

307
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:14,892
What were we doing
that none of us heard about this?

308
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:15,985
I don't know.

309
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,620
A three-hour low-rate
technical row before breakfast.

310
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:20,164
Full course load. Studying.

311
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:22,564
Another three hours in the tank
and then studying.

312
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:23,829
I'm not sure how we missed it.

313
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,563
How much activity was there on this thing?

314
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:27,434
Twenty-two thousand page requests.

315
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:29,331
Twenty-two thousand?

316
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,910
Cam, this guy hacked
the facebook of seven houses.

317
00:18:31,978 --> 00:18:34,640
He set up the whole website in one night,
and he did it while he was drunk.

318
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:35,907
Twenty-two thousand?

319
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:39,417
- Well, how do you know he was drunk?
- He was blogging simutaneously.

320
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:43,148
- You know what I think?
- Way ahead of you.

321
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:44,916
This is our guy.

322
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:46,922
Cameron Winklevoss.

323
00:18:46,993 --> 00:18:50,190
W-I-N-K-L-E-V-O-S-S.

324
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:51,593
"Cameron" spelled the usual way.

325
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:53,256
Tyler Winklevoss.

326
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:56,665
Tyler spelled the usual way, and my
last name is the same as my brother's.

327
00:18:56,836 --> 00:19:00,465
Mr. Zuckerberg, this is
an Administrative Board hearing.

328
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:03,774
You're being accused
of intentionally breaching security,

329
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:05,276
violating copyrights,

330
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:10,646
violating individual privacy
by creating the website www.facemash.com.

331
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,508
You're also charged with
being in violation of university policy,

332
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:15,814
on distribution of digitized images.

333
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:18,948
Before we begin with our questioning,
you're allowed to make a statement.

334
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:20,219
Would you like to do so?

335
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,286
I...

336
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:27,992
You know, I've already apologized
in <i>The Crimson </i>to the ABHW,

337
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:29,659
to Fuerza Latina,

338
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:32,067
and to any women at Harvard
who may have been insulted,

339
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,401
as I take it that they were.

340
00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:37,371
As for any charges stemming
from the breach of security,

341
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:40,343
I believe I deserve
some recognition from this board.

342
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:44,476
- I'm sorry?
- Yes.

343
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:46,545
I don't understand.

344
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:47,676
Which part?

345
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,848
You deserve recognition?

346
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:53,051
I believe I've pointed out
some pretty gaping holes in your system.

347
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:55,150
- Excuse me, may I?
- Yes.

348
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:57,661
Mr. Zuckerberg,

349
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,927
I'm in charge of security
for all computers on the Harvard network,

350
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,433
and I can assure you of its sophistication.

351
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:07,097
In fact, it was that level of sophistication
that led us to you in less than four hours.

352
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,837
- Four hours?
- Yes, sir.

353
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:09,932
That would be impressive,

354
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,373
except if you had known
what you were looking for,

355
00:20:11,444 --> 00:20:13,241
you would have seen it
written on my dorm room window.

356
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:20,009
So?

357
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:22,418
Six months academic probation.

358
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:24,748
Wow. Well, they had to make
an example out of you.

359
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:26,415
They had my blog.

360
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:28,288
I shouldn't have written
that thing about the farm animals.

361
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:29,691
That was stupid.

362
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:32,856
But I was kidding, for God's sakes.
Doesn't anybody have a sense of humor?

363
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:35,366
- I tried to stop you.
- I know.

364
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:38,961
How do you do this thing where
you manage to get all girls to hate us?

365
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,971
- And why do I let you?
- I know.

366
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,564
- You can't do that.
- Wardo, I said I know.

367
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:45,735
Okay, let's look at a sample problem.

368
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:49,212
Suppose we're given a computer
with a 16-bit virtual address

369
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:51,579
and a page size of 256 bytes.

370
00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:56,888
The system uses one-level page tables
that start at address hex 400.

371
00:20:57,423 --> 00:21:00,586
Maybe you want DMA on your 16-bit system.
Who knows?

372
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:04,323
The frst few pages are reserved
for hardware flags, etc.

373
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:07,297
Assume page-table entries have
eight status bits.

374
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:10,233
The eight status bits would then be...

375
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:11,599
Anybody?

376
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:15,306
And I see we have our first surrender.

377
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:16,669
Don't worry, Mr. Zuckerberg.

378
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,971
Brghter men than you
have tried and failed this cass.

379
00:21:19,078 --> 00:21:23,845
One valid bit, one modified bit,
one reference bit and five permission bits.

380
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:27,182
That is correct.

381
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,148
Does everybody see how he got there?

382
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:36,987
Mark?

383
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:40,024
- You Mark Zuckerberg?
- Yeah.

384
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:42,332
- Cameron Winklevoss.
- Hi.

385
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:43,458
Tyler Winklevoss.

386
00:21:43,536 --> 00:21:44,935
Are you guys related?

387
00:21:45,004 --> 00:21:46,494
- That's good.
- Funny.

388
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:48,038
We never heard that before.

389
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,441
So, what can I do for you?
Did I insult your girlfriends?

390
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:52,602
No. You didn't. Actually, I don't know.

391
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:54,373
- Yeah, we never asked.
- We should do that.

392
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,504
No.

393
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:57,548
We have an idea
we want to talk to you about.

394
00:21:58,884 --> 00:21:59,942
You got a minute?

395
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:03,045
You guys look like
you spend some time at the gym.

396
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,679
- We have to.
- Why?

397
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,189
We row crew.

398
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,118
- Yeah I've got a minute.
- Great.

399
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:16,124
- So, you ever been inside the Porcellian?
- No.

400
00:22:16,202 --> 00:22:17,829
You understand we can't take you
past the bike room,

401
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:18,995
because you're not a member.

402
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:20,504
I've heard.

403
00:22:23,242 --> 00:22:26,234
- You want a sandwich or something?
- Okay.

404
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,006
- Mark, right?
- Yeah.

405
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,071
- Mark, this is Divya Narendra, our partner.
- Hi.

406
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:32,013
We were really impressed with Facemash.

407
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:34,678
When we checked you out,
you also built CourseMatch.

408
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:35,811
I don't know CourseMatch.

409
00:22:35,888 --> 00:22:38,322
You go online and see
what courses your friends are taking.

410
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,017
It's really smart, man.

411
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,252
- Mark.
- Yeah.

412
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,159
We were talking about CourseMatch.

413
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:48,197
It was kind of a no-brainer.

414
00:22:48,267 --> 00:22:50,235
But you invented something
in high school, too, right?

415
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:53,728
An app for an MP3 player
that recognizes your taste in music.

416
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:55,767
Anybody try to buy it?

417
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:57,432
Microsoft.

418
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,602
Wow. How much?

419
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:01,771
Didn't sell it. Uploaded it for free.

420
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:03,542
- For free?
- Yeah.

421
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:04,842
Why?

422
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:09,244
Okay, well, we have something
that we've been working on for a while

423
00:23:09,355 --> 00:23:10,413
and we think it's great.

424
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:11,750
It's called the Harvard Connection.

425
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:15,258
You create your own page.
Interests, bio, friends, pics.

426
00:23:15,361 --> 00:23:17,625
And then people can go online,
see your bio, request to be your...

427
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:20,130
Yeah, how is that different
from MySpace or Friendster?

428
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:25,130
Harvard.edu.

429
00:23:25,271 --> 00:23:27,637
Harvard.edu is the most prestigious
e-mail address in the country, man.

430
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:30,071
I mean, the whole site's kind of
based on the idea that girls...

431
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:32,076
Not to put anything indelicately, but...

432
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:33,907
Girls wanna go with guys
who go to Harvard.

433
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:36,277
Divya and my brother don't have trouble
putting things indelicately.

434
00:23:36,382 --> 00:23:39,874
The main difference between what we're
talking about and MySpace or Friendster,

435
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:41,384
or any of those other
social networking sites is...

436
00:23:41,487 --> 00:23:44,217
Is exclusivity. Right?

437
00:23:45,057 --> 00:23:46,081
- Right.
- Yeah.

438
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:47,625
We'd love for you to work with us, Mark.

439
00:23:47,726 --> 00:23:49,421
I mean, we need a gifted programmer
who's creative.

440
00:23:49,495 --> 00:23:51,122
And we know that
you've been taking it in the shins.

441
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:54,131
Women's groups are ready
to declare a fatwa.

442
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:56,667
But, you know, this could help
rehabilitate your image.

443
00:23:57,403 --> 00:23:59,667
Wow. You would do that for me?

444
00:24:02,341 --> 00:24:03,330
We'd like to work with you.

445
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:06,501
Our first programmer graduated
and went to work for Google.

446
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:09,170
Our second programmer
just got overwhelmed with schoolwork.

447
00:24:09,315 --> 00:24:12,478
We would need you to build the site and
write the code, and we'll provide all the...

448
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:13,846
I'm in.

449
00:24:15,354 --> 00:24:16,514
What?

450
00:24:17,523 --> 00:24:18,512
I'm in.

451
00:24:18,991 --> 00:24:19,958
Awesome.

452
00:24:20,526 --> 00:24:21,686
That's what you said?

453
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:25,088
It was three or four years ago.
I don't know what I said.

454
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:26,494
When did you come to Eduardo?

455
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:28,593
I don't understand that question.

456
00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:30,328
Do you remember answering
in the affirmative?

457
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:32,162
The affirmative?

458
00:24:32,271 --> 00:24:34,205
When did you come to Eduardo
with the idea for Facebook?

459
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,939
It was called The Facebook then.

460
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:38,532
This doesn't need to be that difficult.

461
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:41,137
I'm currently in the middle
of two different lawsuits.

462
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:42,612
Did you answer affirmatively

463
00:24:42,715 --> 00:24:45,149
when Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss
and Divya Narendra

464
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:46,809
asked you to build Harvard Connection?

465
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:48,546
Did you say yes?

466
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:51,450
I said I'd help.

467
00:24:51,557 --> 00:24:54,526
When did you approach Mr. Saverin
with the idea for The Facebook?

468
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:56,116
I wouldn't say I approached him.

469
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:58,355
- Sy.
- You can answer the question.

470
00:24:58,464 --> 00:25:00,864
At a party at Apha Epsilon Pi.

471
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:02,331
What's that?

472
00:25:02,401 --> 00:25:04,369
The Jewish fraternity.

473
00:25:05,738 --> 00:25:07,205
It was Caribbean Night.

474
00:25:24,423 --> 00:25:27,153
It's not that guys like me
are generally attracted to Asian girls.

475
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:30,160
It's that Asian girls are
generally attracted to guys like me.

476
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:32,253
I'm developing an algorithm
to define the connection

477
00:25:32,398 --> 00:25:34,263
between Jewish guys and Asian girls.

478
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,369
I don't think it's that complicated.
They're hot, they're smart,

479
00:25:37,436 --> 00:25:40,405
they're not Jewish, and they can't dance.

480
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:41,937
Hey, Mark's here.

481
00:25:42,074 --> 00:25:43,234
Mark!

482
00:25:46,412 --> 00:25:47,936
Be right back.

483
00:25:55,521 --> 00:25:56,545
I think I've come up with something.

484
00:25:56,622 --> 00:25:58,852
Hang on. I gotta tell you something
that you're not gonna believe.

485
00:25:58,957 --> 00:25:59,946
What?

486
00:26:00,092 --> 00:26:02,356
I got punched by the Phoenix.

487
00:26:03,629 --> 00:26:04,618
- Are you kidding?
- No.

488
00:26:04,763 --> 00:26:07,061
I mean, it's just the first
of a four-step process,

489
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:09,930
but they slid the invitation
under my door tonight.

490
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:11,900
I go to my first punch party tomorrow.

491
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,130
So...

492
00:26:13,639 --> 00:26:15,630
You got punched by the Phoenix.

493
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:18,436
Yeah, but, you know,
it was probably just a diversity thing.

494
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:21,036
It was just a diversity thing.
Just ride that horse until...

495
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:22,807
What did you wanna talk to me about?

496
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:24,381
- Mark?
- Yeah.

497
00:26:24,483 --> 00:26:25,472
You said you'd come up with something.

498
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:28,211
Yeah, I think I've come up with something.
Come outside and let's talk.

499
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,582
It's 20 degrees outside.

500
00:26:29,655 --> 00:26:31,816
I can't stare at that loop of Niagara Falls,

501
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:33,982
which has absolutely
nothing to do with the Caribbean.

502
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:47,135
People came to Facemash
in a stampede, right?

503
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:48,297
Yeah.

504
00:26:48,407 --> 00:26:49,965
But it wasn't because
they saw pictures of hot girls.

505
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:52,270
You can go anywhere on the Internet
and see pictures of hot girls.

506
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:53,402
Yeah.

507
00:26:53,512 --> 00:26:56,140
It was because they saw pictures
of girls that they knew.

508
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:58,582
People want to go on the Internet
and check out their friends,

509
00:26:58,684 --> 00:27:00,117
so why not build a website that offers that?

510
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:03,313
Friends, pictures, profiles,
whatever you can visit.

511
00:27:03,422 --> 00:27:05,185
Browse around.
Maybe it's someone you just met at a party.

512
00:27:05,324 --> 00:27:07,417
But I'm not talking about a dating site.

513
00:27:07,526 --> 00:27:12,930
I'm talking about taking the entire social
experience of college and puttng it online.

514
00:27:13,332 --> 00:27:15,596
- I can't feel my legs.
- I know.

515
00:27:15,701 --> 00:27:17,191
I'm totaly psyched about this, too.
But, Wardo?

516
00:27:17,336 --> 00:27:18,360
Yeah?

517
00:27:18,537 --> 00:27:20,528
"It wou d be exclusive."

518
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,633
You would have to know the people
on the site to get past your own page.

519
00:27:23,709 --> 00:27:25,609
Like getting punched.

520
00:27:26,545 --> 00:27:27,603
Now, that's good.

521
00:27:27,713 --> 00:27:29,840
Wardo, it's like a final club,
except we're the president.

522
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:33,112
I told him I thought it sounded great.

523
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:35,217
It was a great idea.

524
00:27:35,354 --> 00:27:36,343
There was nothing to hack.

525
00:27:36,455 --> 00:27:39,481
People were gonna provide
their own pictures, their own information.

526
00:27:39,558 --> 00:27:44,359
And people had the ability to invite,
or not invite, their friends to join.

527
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:48,488
See, in a world where
social structure was everything,

528
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:50,396
that was the thing.

529
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:52,300
It was a big project,

530
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:55,532
and he was going to have to write
tens of thousands of lines of code,

531
00:27:55,641 --> 00:27:58,235
so I wondered why he was
coming to me and not his roommates,

532
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:01,005
Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes.
They were programmers.

533
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:04,479
We're gonna need a little start-up cash
to rent the servers and get it online.

534
00:28:05,651 --> 00:28:06,675
So that was why.

535
00:28:06,752 --> 00:28:08,379
- Did he offer terms?
- Yes.

536
00:28:08,487 --> 00:28:10,421
We'll split it 70/30.

537
00:28:10,589 --> 00:28:13,057
70 for me, 30 for you
for putting up the $1,000

538
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:15,388
and for handling everything
on the business end. You're CFO.

539
00:28:15,494 --> 00:28:16,518
<i>And you said?</i>

540
00:28:16,595 --> 00:28:18,222
I said, "Let's do it."

541
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:20,195
Okay. Did he add anything else?

542
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:21,657
Yes.

543
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,930
It probably was a diversity thing.

544
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:30,334
But so what?

545
00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:31,771
Why do you think he said that?

546
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:34,072
Gretchen, excuse me for interrupting,
but whose discovery is this?

547
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:35,908
Sy, if you'll let me continue
with my line of questioning.

548
00:28:36,014 --> 00:28:37,072
What are you suggesting?

549
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:39,343
That I was jealous of Eduardo
for getting punched by the Phoenix

550
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:41,009
and began a plan
to screw him out of a company

551
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:42,780
- I hadn't even invented yet.
- Were you?

552
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:44,116
- Gretchen.
- Jealous of Eduardo?

553
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:45,451
Stop typing. We're off the record.

554
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:46,581
Ma'am, I know you've done your homework,

555
00:28:46,692 --> 00:28:48,250
and so you know that money
isn't a big part of my life.

556
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,351
But at the moment,
I could buy Mount Auburn Street,

557
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:53,625
take the Phoenix Club
and turn it into my ping-pong room.

558
00:28:57,869 --> 00:28:59,860
I'll let you know how the party is.

559
00:29:05,711 --> 00:29:08,976
<i>We recognize that you're a plaintiff</i>
<i>in one suit involving Facebook,</i>

560
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:10,478
and a witness in another.

561
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:11,640
Yes, sir.

562
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,742
At any time in the weeks
prior to Mark's telling you his idea,

563
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,311
did he mention Tyler Winklevoss,
Cameron Winklevoss,

564
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,720
Divya Narendra or Harvard Connection?

565
00:29:19,825 --> 00:29:22,453
Yes. He said they'd asked him
to work on their site,

566
00:29:22,561 --> 00:29:26,463
but that he looked at what they had
and decided it wasn't worth his time.

567
00:29:26,565 --> 00:29:28,123
He said even his most pathetic friends

568
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:32,101
knew more about getting people
interested in a website than these guys.

569
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:34,104
"These guys," meaning my clients.

570
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:38,131
Yes. He resented...
Mark resented that your clients thought

571
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:40,643
that he needed to rehabilitate
his image after Facemash.

572
00:29:40,746 --> 00:29:42,805
But Mark didn't want
to rehabilitate anything.

573
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:45,678
With Facemash, he'd hacked into
the Harvard computers,

574
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:48,412
he'd thumbed his nose at the Ad Board,
he'd gotten a lot of notoriety.

575
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,114
Facemash did exacty
what he wanted it to do.

576
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:53,657
Were you aware that while Mr. Zuckerberg
was building The Facebook,

577
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:55,522
he was also communicating
with the plaintiffs?

578
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,788
Not at the time, I wasn't. But...

579
00:29:59,698 --> 00:30:02,496
It really didn't have much to do
with the Winklevosses' dating site.

580
00:30:02,601 --> 00:30:03,625
How would you know?
You weren't even there.

581
00:30:03,702 --> 00:30:04,794
Ty.

582
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:08,197
Were you aware that while Mr. Zuckerberg
was building The Facebook,

583
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:11,765
he was leading the plaintiffs to believe
he was building Harvard Connection?

584
00:30:11,877 --> 00:30:13,310
You're offering a conclusion
not found in evidence.

585
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:16,040
We are about to find it in evidence.

Okay, anybody else feel like
there's something up with this guy?

600
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:00,181
Tell him okay,

601
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:03,022
but we do have to make sure that
we meet up before we all go off for break.

602

I know, I know. Yeah, watch out.

603
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:38,523
Hey, Mark.

604
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:41,531
I need a dedicated Linux box
running Apache with a MySQL back end.

605
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:43,100
It's gonna cost a lttle more money.

- How much more?
- About 200 more.

607
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:48,137
- Do we need it?
- Gotta handle the traffic.

608
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:53,376
- Do it
- I already did.

609
00:31:57,716 --> 00:31:58,808
Hey, guess what?

610
00:32:00,552 --> 00:32:02,144
I made the second cut.

611
00:32:02,888 --> 00:32:03,912
That's good.

612
00:32:03,989 --> 00:32:07,652
You should be proud of that right there.
Don't worry if you don't make it any further.

613
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:13,964
I'll get out of here.

614
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:16,397
<i>From Mark Zuckerberg</i>
<i>to Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss</i>

615
00:32:16,468 --> 00:32:17,492
and Divya Narendra.

616
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,763
December 15th, 2003.

617
00:32:19,838 --> 00:32:22,238
"I have a CS problem set
that I'm just gettng started with

618
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:25,970
"and t should be about 15 hours of coding,
so I'll be busy tomorrow night."

619
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:29,410
"I won't really be free to meet
until next Wednesday afternoon."

620
00:32:29,481 --> 00:32:31,608
"I have to cancel Wednesday afternoon.

621
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:34,846
"I've basically been in the lab
this whole time and also I..."

622
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:39,582
"...won't be able to do Saturday,
as I have to meet up with my parents."

623
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:48,132
As the plaque reads, this is John Harvard,
founder of Harvard University in 1638.

624
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,532
It's also called the Statue of Three Lies.

625
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:53,463
What are the three lies?

626
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:55,431
Mr Dowd.

627
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,633
The three lies. First...

628
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:58,833
Shit!

629
00:32:58,944 --> 00:33:00,775
- Take your pants off.
- I know.

630
00:33:01,947 --> 00:33:03,175
Mr. Saverin.

631
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:06,808
One, Harvard was founded in 1636, not 1638.

632
00:33:06,885 --> 00:33:09,217
Two, Harvard was not founded
by John Harvard.

633
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:10,845
And three, that is not John Harvard.

634
00:33:10,956 --> 00:33:12,287
Who is it?

635
00:33:12,858 --> 00:33:16,487
It's a friend of the sculptor, Daniel Chester.

636
00:33:17,395 --> 00:33:18,521
Keep your jacket on.

637
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:25,959
Thirty-nine days after Mr Zuckerberg's
initial meeting with my clients,

638
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:29,404
and he still hadn't completed work
on Harvard Connection.

639
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:32,305
<i>But on January 11th, 2004,</i>

640
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:36,241
<i>Mr. Zuckerberg registered</i>
<i>the domain name The Facebook</i>

641
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:39,146
<i>via Network Solutions</i>.

642
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:44,254
To the best of your knowledge, had he even
begun work on Harvard Connection?

643
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:47,482
Not to my knowledge. No.

644
00:33:51,763 --> 00:33:53,890
What in the world is this?

645
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:59,094
"Hey, Cameron, I'm still a little skeptical
that we have enough functionality in the site

646
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:01,764
"to really draw the attention
and gain the crtical mass necessary

647
00:34:02,007 --> 00:34:04,498
"to get a site like this to run"?

648
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,408
"We'll speak soon"?

649
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:11,341
This is the first time
he mentioned any problem?

650
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:12,507
Yes, it was.

651
00:34:12,584 --> 00:34:17,078
You sent 36 e-mails to Mr. Zuckerberg
and received 16 e-mails in return,

652
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:19,748
and this was the first time
he indicated he was not happy.

653
00:34:19,858 --> 00:34:20,882
That's correct.

654
00:34:20,959 --> 00:34:23,621
He had 42 days to study our system
and get out ahead.

655
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,787
- Do you see any of your code on Facebook?
- Sy, could you...

656
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,421
Did I use any of your code?

657
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:29,363
You stole our whole goddamn idea.

658
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:31,629
- Fellas.
- What? Match.com for Harvard guys?

659
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:32,862
Can I continue with my deposition?

660
00:34:32,938 --> 00:34:36,066
You know, you really don't need
a forensics team to get to the bottom of this.

661
00:34:36,141 --> 00:34:37,768
If you guys were the inventors of Facebook,

662
00:34:39,144 --> 00:34:41,135
you'd have invented Facebook.

663
00:34:41,947 --> 00:34:44,541
I can't wait to stand over your shoulder
and watch you write us a check.

664
00:34:44,616 --> 00:34:45,913
No shit.

665
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:48,983
Let's continue.

666
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:53,123
February 4, 2004.

667
00:34:56,728 --> 00:34:57,888
Mark.

668
00:34:58,630 --> 00:34:59,790
Mark.

669
00:34:59,898 --> 00:35:03,766
There is a girl in your art history class.
Her name is Stephanie Attis.

670
00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:05,735
Do you happen to know
if she has a boyfriend?

671
00:35:07,172 --> 00:35:09,402
Have you ever seen her with anyone?

672
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:14,670
And, if not, do you happen to know
if she's looking to go out with anyone?

673
00:35:14,813 --> 00:35:16,075
Dustin.

674
00:35:17,515 --> 00:35:21,281
People don't walk around with
a sign on them that says...

675
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:26,583
Mark?

676
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:55,448
We were supposed to meet at 9:00.

677
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,284
- Have you slept yet?
- I have to add something.

678
00:35:58,356 --> 00:35:59,516
What?

679
00:36:10,702 --> 00:36:12,670
Shit, that looks good.
That looks really good.

680
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:14,204
It's clean and simple.

681
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:17,001
No Disneyland, no "live nude girls."
But watch.

682
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:20,139
What'd you write?

683
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:23,176
"Relationship Status." "Interested In."

684
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:26,181
This is what drives life at college.
"Are you having sex or aren't you?"

685
00:36:26,251 --> 00:36:29,550
It's why people take certain classes
and sit where they sit and do what they do.

686
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:33,522
And at its center, you know, that's
what The Facebook is gonna be about.

687
00:36:33,591 --> 00:36:35,821
People are gonna log on because
after all the cake and watermelon,

688
00:36:35,894 --> 00:36:36,918
there's a chance they're actually gonna...

689
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:39,223
- Gonna get laid
- ...meet a girl. Yes.

690
00:36:39,831 --> 00:36:40,855
That is really good.

691
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:41,990
And that was it.

692
00:36:42,067 --> 00:36:43,728
- What do you mean?
- It's ready.

693
00:36:43,835 --> 00:36:45,928
- It's ready? Right now?
- Yeah. That was it.

694
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:48,028
And here's the masthead.

695
00:36:48,106 --> 00:36:49,573
- You made a masthead.
- Yeah.

696
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:53,041
- "Eduardo Saverin, co-founder and CFO."
- Yeah.

697
00:36:53,111 --> 00:36:55,170
You have no idea what
that's gonna mean to my father.

698
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:56,577
Sure I do.

699
00:36:59,084 --> 00:37:01,109
So when's it going live?

700
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,120
Right now. Get your laptop out.

701
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:06,882
What? Why do we need my laptop?

702
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:10,450
Because you got e-mails
for everybody at the Phoenix.

703
00:37:14,032 --> 00:37:18,059
Yeah, I'm not sure if it's gonna be cool
with them that I spam their e-mails.

704
00:37:18,136 --> 00:37:20,866
- This is not spam.
- No, I know it's not spam.

705
00:37:20,939 --> 00:37:23,271
If we send it to our friends,
it's just gonna bounce around Dworkin.

706
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:24,705
I haven't gotten in yet.

707
00:37:24,776 --> 00:37:27,802
These guys know people.
And I need their e-mails.

708
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:30,875
- Sure.
- Good.

709
00:37:32,117 --> 00:37:33,141
Give me the mailing list.

710
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,583
Jabberwock12.listserv@harvard.edu.

711
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:36,813
These guys.

712
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:37,945
Yeah, they're literary geniuses

713
00:37:38,056 --> 00:37:40,149
because the world's most obvious
Lewis Carroll reference is in...

714
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,782
- They're not so bad.
- I'm just saying.

715
00:37:41,893 --> 00:37:43,656
Yeah, you're right.

716
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:52,092
The site's live.

717
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:55,234
You know, let's go get a drink and celebrate.

718
00:37:56,741 --> 00:37:58,140
I'm buying.

719
00:37:59,577 --> 00:38:00,737
Mark.

720
00:38:03,515 --> 00:38:04,914
Mark, are you praying?

721
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:20,854
Whatever happened to Cole Porter
and Irving Berlin?

722
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:23,023
It's a Valentine's Day theme.
They're playing love songs.

723
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,158
Good point.

724
00:38:24,269 --> 00:38:27,170
'Cause Cole Porter and Irving Berin
never wrote any love songs.

725
00:38:30,942 --> 00:38:33,342
Honey, you should put your laptop away.

726
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:35,378
Seven different people
spammed me the same link.

727
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,038
- KC.
- What is it?

728
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,172
I don't know.

729
00:38:38,283 --> 00:38:40,012
But I'm really hoping
it's Cats That Look Like Hitler,

730
00:38:40,118 --> 00:38:41,813
'cause I can never get enough of that.

731
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,478
No, it's not.

732
00:38:49,027 --> 00:38:50,187
Div!

733
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:52,956
What?

734
00:38:58,670 --> 00:38:59,694
This isn't mine.

735
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:01,529
Okay, what is wrong?

736
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:06,976
It's fine. It's fine. It's fine.

737
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,318
Hey!

738
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:24,653
Hey!

739
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:25,889
Not now!

740
00:39:25,997 --> 00:39:27,055
We need 20 minutes!

741
00:39:27,165 --> 00:39:28,530
Okay.

742
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:32,864
I just wanted to let you know
that Zuckerberg stole our website.

743
00:39:34,439 --> 00:39:36,100
Mark Zuckerberg?

744
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:38,405
He stole our website.

745
00:39:39,244 --> 00:39:40,871
It's been live for more than 36 hours.

746
00:39:46,084 --> 00:39:48,575
Mr. Hotchkiss?
Ty, lawyer's on the phone with Dad.

747
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:51,211
Yes, sir, I'm here with my brother Tyler
and our business partner Divya.

748
00:39:51,289 --> 00:39:52,347
"Welcome to The Facebook.

749
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:54,357
"The Facebook is an online directory
that connects people

750
00:39:54,425 --> 00:39:55,892
"through different social networks.

751
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:59,123
"You must have a harvard.edu address
to register."

752
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,698
Yeah, I called earier.
I'm looking for Mark Zuckerberg.

753
00:40:01,766 --> 00:40:03,097
Yes, sir.
He's actually quoted a couple times.

754
00:40:03,201 --> 00:40:04,225
I can read it to you.

755
00:40:04,302 --> 00:40:07,533
"'Everyone's been talking a lot about a
universal facebook within Harvard,' he says."

756
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:08,629
"He" meaning Mark.

757
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,708
"'I think it's kind of silly
that it would take the university

758
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:11,901
"'a couple of years to get around to it.

759
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:14,536
"'I can do a classier job than they can
and I did it in a week."'

760
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:15,806
Tell him Divya Narendra called.

761
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:17,973
- I know, that's how he talks.
- Appreciate it.

762
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:20,141
"As of yesterday evening, Zuckerberg said,

763
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:23,982
"over 650 students had registered
to use thefacebook.com.

764
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:27,649
"He said he anticipated that 900 students
would have joined the site by this morning."

765
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:30,989
Yeah, Divya was just reading that 650
students signed up for it on the first day.

766
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:35,327
God, if I was a drug dealer I couldn't
give free drugs to 650 people in one day.

767
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:38,925
And this guy doesn't have three friends
to rub together to make a fourth.

768
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:40,493
All right.
Yes, that's what we'll do, Mr. Hotchkiss.

769
00:40:40,638 --> 00:40:42,503
We'll put all this together
and we'll e-mail it to you.

770
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,335
Well, you won't be able
to go on the website yourself.

771
00:40:45,343 --> 00:40:47,504
Because you don't have a Harvard...

772
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:49,943
You know what, it would just be easier
for us to e-mail it to you.

773
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:51,003
I'm sure you're right.

774
00:40:51,149 --> 00:40:54,016
He's a good guy and he's very bright
and I'm sure he didn't mean to do...

775
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:55,176
Wow.

776
00:40:55,653 --> 00:40:56,677
...what he did.

777
00:40:57,622 --> 00:40:59,021
All right, thank you very much. And, Dad...

778
00:40:59,657 --> 00:41:00,681
All right, love you, too.

779
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:03,522
- This is a good guy?
- We don't know that he's not a good guy.

780
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:04,617
We know he stole our idea.

781
00:41:04,696 --> 00:41:06,129
We know he lied to our faces
for a month and a half.

782
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:08,358
- No, he never lied to our faces.
- Okay, he never saw our faces.

783
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:11,867
Fine, he lied to our e-mail accounts
and he gave himself a 42-day head start,

784
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:13,961
because he knows
what apparently you don't,

785
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:15,801
which is that getting there first
is everything.

786
00:41:15,873 --> 00:41:16,862
I'm a competitive racer, Div.

787
00:41:17,008 --> 00:41:20,375
I don't think you need to school me in the
importance of getting there first. Thank you.

788
00:41:20,712 --> 00:41:22,805
- That was your father's lawyer?
- It was his in-house counsel.

789
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,814
He's gonna look at all this
and if he thinks it's appropriate

790
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:25,871
he'll send a cease-and-desist letter.

791
00:41:26,017 --> 00:41:27,041
What's that gonna do?

792
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,482
What, do you wanna hire an IP lawyer
and sue him?

793
00:41:28,553 --> 00:41:31,716
No, I wanna hire the Sopranos to beat
the shit out of him with a hammer.

794
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:32,881
- We don't even have to do that.
- That's right.

795
00:41:33,024 --> 00:41:36,323
We could do that ourselves.
I'm 6'5", 220, and there's two of me.

796
00:41:36,394 --> 00:41:37,383
- I'm with this guy.
- Well, whatever.

797
00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:39,894
I'm saying, let's calm down
until we know what we're talking about.

798
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:42,057
How much more information
are you waiting for?

799
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:44,999
We met with Mark three times,
we exchanged 52 e-mails,

800
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:46,661
we can prove that he looked at the code.

801
00:41:46,738 --> 00:41:49,832
- What is that on the bottom of the page?
- It says "A Mark Zuckerberg production."

802
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:52,171
- On the home page?
- On every page.

803
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:54,905
Shit, I need a second to let
the classiness waft over me.

804
00:41:55,046 --> 00:41:56,070
Okay, look, we don't know...

805
00:41:56,214 --> 00:41:58,079
Cam, they wrote, "Zuckerberg said
he hoped the privacy options

806
00:41:58,216 --> 00:42:00,081
"would help restore his reputation

807
00:42:00,218 --> 00:42:03,187
"following student outrage
over facemash.com."

808
00:42:03,254 --> 00:42:06,587
That's exactly what we said to him.
He's giving us the finger in <i>The Crimson</i>.

809
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:09,351
While we're waiting for Dad's lawyer
to look this stuff over,

810
00:42:09,427 --> 00:42:11,861
we can at least get something
going in the paper so people know...

811
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:13,419
- What?
- ...that this is in dispute.

812
00:42:13,564 --> 00:42:15,589
We're not starting a knife fight
in <i>The Crimson.</i>

813
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,099
And we're not suing anybody.

814
00:42:17,235 --> 00:42:18,532
Why not?

815
00:42:19,937 --> 00:42:22,428
I don't understand, I don't understand.
Why not?

816
00:42:23,608 --> 00:42:25,439
He's gonna say it's stupid.

817
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:26,532
What, who, me?

818
00:42:26,611 --> 00:42:28,101
Say it. Why not?

819
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,708
Because we're gentlemen of Harvard.

820
00:42:31,783 --> 00:42:36,117
This is Harvard, where you don't
plant stories and you don't sue people.

821
00:42:36,788 --> 00:42:39,723
You thought he was gonna be
the only one who thought that was stupid?

822
00:42:39,791 --> 00:42:42,453
Durng the time when you say
you had this idea,

823
00:42:43,127 --> 00:42:46,619
did you know Tyler and Cameron
came from a family of means?

824
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:48,797
"A family of means"?

825
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,424
Did you know their father was wealthy?

826
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:52,964
I'm not sure why you're asking me that.

827
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:55,301
It's not important you be sure
why I'm asking.

828
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,408
- It's not important to you.
- Sy.

829
00:42:58,476 --> 00:43:00,307
Did you know that they came from money?

830
00:43:00,445 --> 00:43:02,310
I had no idea whether
they came from money or not.

831
00:43:02,447 --> 00:43:04,415
In one of your e-mails to Mr Narendra,

832
00:43:04,482 --> 00:43:07,815
you referenced Howard Winklevoss'
consulting firm.

833
00:43:07,952 --> 00:43:09,146
If you say so.

834
00:43:09,287 --> 00:43:12,984
Howard Winklevoss founded a firm whose
assets are in the hundreds of millions.

835
00:43:13,124 --> 00:43:15,319
You also knew Tyler and Cameron
were members

836
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,758
of a Harvard final club called the Porcellian.

837
00:43:17,829 --> 00:43:19,091
They pointed that out.

838
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:21,154
- Excuse us for inviting you in.
- To the bike room.

839
00:43:21,299 --> 00:43:25,258
Please. So it's safe to say you were aware
that my clients had money.

840
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:27,927
Yes.

841
00:43:28,005 --> 00:43:29,438
Let me tell you why I'm asking.

842
00:43:29,507 --> 00:43:32,943
I'm wondering why, if you needed $1,000
for an Internet venture,

843
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:34,602
you didn't ask my clients for it.

844
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:37,170
They had demonstrated an interest to you
in that kind of thing.

845
00:43:37,315 --> 00:43:40,341
I went to my friend for the money because
that's who I wanted to be partners with.

846
00:43:40,485 --> 00:43:42,953
Eduardo was the president of
the Harvard Investors Association,

847
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:44,988
and he was also my best friend.

848
00:43:45,823 --> 00:43:49,452
Your best friend is suing you
for $600 million.

849
00:43:49,994 --> 00:43:52,360
I didn't know that. Tell me more.

850
00:43:52,497 --> 00:43:54,692
Eduardo, what happened
afterthe initial launch?

851
00:43:54,832 --> 00:43:57,027
I'm sorry, Sy, would you mind
addressing him as Mr. Saverin?

852
00:43:57,168 --> 00:43:58,795
- Gretchen, they're best friends.
- Not anymore.

853
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:00,861
Well, we already went through this on the...
Never mind.

854
00:44:01,005 --> 00:44:03,633
Mr. Saverin, what happened
after the initial launch?

855
00:44:03,708 --> 00:44:05,141
It exploded.

856
00:44:05,209 --> 00:44:07,040
Everybody on campus was using it.

857
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:10,706
"Facebook me" was a common expression
after two weeks.

858
00:44:11,182 --> 00:44:12,206
And Mark?

859
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:16,150
And Mark was the biggest thing on
a campus that included 19 Nobel laureates,

860
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:20,714
15 Pulitzer Prize winners,
two future Olympians, and a movie star.

861
00:44:20,892 --> 00:44:22,484
Who was the movie star?

862
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,152
Does it matter?

863
00:44:24,529 --> 00:44:25,553
No.

864
00:44:27,865 --> 00:44:31,631
...at Out of Town News and picked up
that copy of <i>Popular Electronics</i> magazine

865
00:44:31,736 --> 00:44:33,897
with the MITS Altair kit on the cover.

866
00:44:34,038 --> 00:44:36,529
It was a beautiful day
and I was in my Radcliffe dorm room.

867
00:44:36,641 --> 00:44:38,666
He brought that magazine up
and he showed it to me and he said,

868
00:44:38,743 --> 00:44:42,645
"Look, it's gonna happen without us.
We've gotta start now."

869
00:44:42,747 --> 00:44:45,875
And I said, "Okay
Let's get BASIC out there."

870
00:44:46,484 --> 00:44:49,351
Now, most of you think you know
the rest of the story, but you may not.

871
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:51,718
The beginnings of this industry
were very humble.

872
00:44:51,822 --> 00:44:56,054
That kit computer on the cover of
that magazine had an 8080 processor in it.

873
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:00,256
Unless you paid extra for
a 1K memory board, you got 256 bytes.

874
00:45:00,831 --> 00:45:04,767
So the challenge when I wrote BASIC
wasnt just to run at 4 k-bytes,

875
00:45:04,902 --> 00:45:09,771
but I also had to leave room for the users
to run their programs in 4 k-bytes.

876
00:45:10,942 --> 00:45:12,933
Your friend. Is that Mark Zuckerberg?

877
00:45:13,277 --> 00:45:14,335
Yeah.

878
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:16,606
- He made The Facebook.
- Yeah.

879
00:45:16,948 --> 00:45:19,280
I mean, it's both of ours. We're...

880
00:45:19,417 --> 00:45:21,248
Yeah, we... Yes.

881
00:45:21,352 --> 00:45:22,512
Cool.

882
00:45:22,787 --> 00:45:24,254
I'm Christy Ling. This is Alice.

883
00:45:24,355 --> 00:45:25,379
Hi.

884
00:45:25,456 --> 00:45:27,686
Well, very nice to meet you.

885
00:45:28,025 --> 00:45:29,515
Facebook me when you get home.

886
00:45:29,627 --> 00:45:31,117
You know, maybe we can all go out
and grab a drink.

887
00:45:31,963 --> 00:45:32,952
Certainly.

888
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:34,961
Absolutely do that.

889
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:44,935
She said, "Facebook me
and we can all go for a drink later,"

890
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:46,566
which is stunningly great for two reasons.

891
00:45:46,644 --> 00:45:49,374
One, she said "facebook me," right?
And then the other is, well, you know...

892
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:50,469
They wanna have drinks later.

893
00:45:50,615 --> 00:45:52,207
Yes, have you ever heard
so many different good things

894
00:45:52,316 --> 00:45:53,806
packed into one regular-sized sentence?

895
00:45:53,951 --> 00:45:55,612
Excuse me, Mark?

896
00:45:56,153 --> 00:45:57,245
Yeah?

897
00:45:57,321 --> 00:45:59,152
I'm Stuart Singer. I'm in your OS lab.

898
00:45:59,824 --> 00:46:00,882
Sure.

899
00:46:01,392 --> 00:46:03,223
- Awesome job with The Facebook.
- Awesome job.

900
00:46:03,327 --> 00:46:04,316
Thanks.

901
00:46:04,462 --> 00:46:06,259
- I'm Bob.
- How you doing?

902
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:07,763
You know, I could swear
he was looking at you

903
00:46:07,832 --> 00:46:11,063
when he said the next Bill Gates
could be right in this room.

904
00:46:11,168 --> 00:46:12,635
I doubt it.

905
00:46:12,737 --> 00:46:15,262
And I showed up late.
I don't even know who the speaker was.

906
00:46:16,674 --> 00:46:18,164
It was Bill Gates.

907
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:21,434
Shit, that makes sense.

908
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,339
All right. Thanks, guys.

909
00:46:26,851 --> 00:46:28,580
- Are you a moron?
- Are you medically stupid?

910
00:46:28,686 --> 00:46:30,347
You can't tell Bill Gates
is in front of you for an hour?

911
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:32,285
I wasn't wearing my contacts.

912
00:46:32,356 --> 00:46:34,756
Can I get a Glock and kill you?

913
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,952
It's time to monetize the thing.

914
00:46:38,029 --> 00:46:39,326
What were their names?

915
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:41,193
- Hear what I just said?
- When?

916
00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:43,358
I said it's time to monetize the site.

917
00:46:44,368 --> 00:46:45,357
What does that mean?

918
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:48,302
It means it's time for the website
to start generating revenue.

919
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:50,704
No, I know what the word means.
I'm asking how you wanna do it.

920
00:46:52,043 --> 00:46:53,704
- Advertising.
- No.

921
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:56,272
Well, we got 4,000 members.

922
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:57,506
'Cause The Facebook is cool,

923
00:46:57,615 --> 00:47:00,812
and if we start installing pop-ups
for Mountain Dew, it's not gonna be cool.

924
00:47:00,885 --> 00:47:02,512
Well, I wasn't thinking Mountain Dew,
but at some point,

925
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:05,054
and I'm talking as the business end
of the company, the site...

926
00:47:05,156 --> 00:47:08,353
We don't even know what it is yet.
We don't know what it is.

927
00:47:08,459 --> 00:47:10,893
We don't know what it can be.
We don't know what it will be.

928
00:47:10,995 --> 00:47:12,326
We know that it is cool.

929
00:47:12,396 --> 00:47:14,626
That is a priceless asset I'm not giving up.

930
00:47:14,732 --> 00:47:16,893
- So when will it be finished?
- It won't be finished.

931
00:47:17,001 --> 00:47:18,696
That's the point.
The way fashion's never finished.

932
00:47:18,803 --> 00:47:21,067
- What?
- Fashion. Fashion is never finished.

933
00:47:21,172 --> 00:47:22,639
You're talking about fashion? Really, you?

934
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:25,300
I'm talking about the idea of it
and I'm saying that it's never finished.

935
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:28,742
Okay. But they manage
to make money selling pants.

936
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:31,504
Mark, what is this?

937
00:47:31,582 --> 00:47:33,049
- What?
- This.

938
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:35,414
It's called a cease-and-desist letter.
What were their names?

939
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:36,543
- Who?
- The girls.

940
00:47:36,654 --> 00:47:37,814
When did you get this?

941
00:47:37,922 --> 00:47:40,015
About 10 days ago.
Right after we launched the site.

942
00:47:40,091 --> 00:47:41,922
- Jesus Christ.
- Hey, the girls. What were their names?

943
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:45,154
The Winklevoss twins are saying
that you stole their idea.

944
00:47:45,262 --> 00:47:47,594
I find that to be a little more
than mildly annoying.

945
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:50,929
Oh, well, they find it to be
intellectual property theft.

946
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:52,229
- Look...
- Why didn't you show this to me?

947
00:47:52,336 --> 00:47:53,826
It was addressed to me.

948
00:47:53,938 --> 00:47:57,032
They're saying that we stole The Facebook
from Divya Narendra and the Winklevosses.

949
00:47:57,108 --> 00:47:59,167
- I know what it says.
- Did we?

950
00:47:59,276 --> 00:48:00,265
Did we what?

951
00:48:00,378 --> 00:48:01,936
Don't screw around with me now.
Look at me.

952
00:48:02,613 --> 00:48:04,274
The letter says we could face legal action.

953
00:48:04,382 --> 00:48:06,043
No, it says I could face legal action.

954
00:48:06,117 --> 00:48:08,381
This is from a lawyer, Mark.
They must feel they have some grounds.

955
00:48:08,452 --> 00:48:11,580
- The lawyer is their father's house counsel.
- Do they have grounds?

956
00:48:11,689 --> 00:48:13,088
The grounds are
our thing is cool and popular,

957
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:14,589
and Harvard Connection is lame.

958
00:48:14,692 --> 00:48:16,922
Wardo, I didn't use any of their code,
I promise.

959
00:48:17,027 --> 00:48:18,051
I didn't use anything.

960
00:48:18,129 --> 00:48:19,960
Look, a guy who builds a nice chair
doesn't owe money

961
00:48:20,064 --> 00:48:21,691
to everyone who ever
has built a chair, okay?

962
00:48:21,799 --> 00:48:23,596
They came to me with an idea,
I had a better one.

963
00:48:23,701 --> 00:48:26,397
- Why didn't you show me this letter?
- I didn't think it was a big deal.

964
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:29,899
Okay.

965
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:36,805
So if there's something wrong, if there's
ever anything wrong, you can tell me.

966
00:48:37,081 --> 00:48:39,549
I'm the guy that wants to help.
This is our thing.

967
00:48:39,617 --> 00:48:43,075
Now, is there anything
that you need to tell me?

968
00:48:43,554 --> 00:48:44,612
No.

969
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:49,449
What are we doing about this?

970
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:52,961
I went to a 3L at Student Legal Services
and he told me to write them back.

971
00:48:53,063 --> 00:48:54,223
And what did you say?

972
00:48:54,298 --> 00:48:57,426
"When we met in January,
I expressed my doubts about the site.

973
00:48:57,501 --> 00:48:59,901
"Where it stood with graphics,
how much programing was left

974
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:01,403
"that I had not anticipated."

975
00:49:01,472 --> 00:49:03,736
"The lack of hardware
we had to deal with site use,

976
00:49:03,808 --> 00:49:07,073
"the lack of promotion that would go on
to successfully launch the website."

977
00:49:07,144 --> 00:49:10,739
This was the first time you raised
any of those concerns, right?

978
00:49:10,815 --> 00:49:12,442
I'd raised concerns before.

979
00:49:12,516 --> 00:49:13,778
- Bullshit.
- Not to us.

980
00:49:13,851 --> 00:49:17,912
Gentlemen, I'm talking about at the meeting
in January to which this letter is referring.

981
00:49:17,988 --> 00:49:19,012
Yeah.

982
00:49:19,123 --> 00:49:20,988
Let me rephrase this.

983
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:25,752
You sent my client 16 e-mails.
In the first 15 you didn't raise any concerns.

984
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:26,922
Is that a question?

985
00:49:26,997 --> 00:49:30,524
In the 16th e-mail you raised concerns
about the site's functionality.

986
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:33,364
- Were you leading them on for six weeks?
- No.

987
00:49:33,471 --> 00:49:36,531
Then why didn't you raise
any of these concerns before?

988
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,505
- It's raining.
- I'm sorry?

989
00:49:38,609 --> 00:49:39,837
It just started raining.

990
00:49:39,944 --> 00:49:43,004
Mr. Zuckerberg,
do I have your full attention?

991
00:49:43,848 --> 00:49:44,940
No.

992
00:49:46,016 --> 00:49:47,381
Do you think I deserve it?

993
00:49:47,685 --> 00:49:48,709
What?

994
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:51,788
Do you think I deserve your full attention?

995
00:49:52,323 --> 00:49:54,348
I had to swear an oath
before we began this deposition

996
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:57,552
and I don't wanna perjure myself,
so I have a legal obligation to say no.

997
00:49:57,661 --> 00:50:01,461
Okay. No.
You don't think I deserve your attention?

998
00:50:01,532 --> 00:50:04,558
I think if your clients wanna sit on
my shoulders and call themselves tall,

999
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:05,794
they have a right to give it a try,

1000
00:50:05,870 --> 00:50:09,203
but there's no requirement that I enjoy
sitting here listening to people lie.

1001
00:50:10,374 --> 00:50:12,706
You have part of my attention.
You have the minimum amount.

1002
00:50:13,544 --> 00:50:16,012
The rest of my attention is
back at the offices of Facebook,

1003
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:18,378
where my colleagues and I are doing things
that no one in this room,

1004
00:50:18,482 --> 00:50:20,040
including and especially your clients,

1005
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:23,483
are intellectually or creatively
capable of doing.

1006
00:50:24,355 --> 00:50:27,256
Did I adequately answer
your condescending question?

1007
00:50:34,365 --> 00:50:37,926
Well, I have 12:45.
Why don't we say that's lunch?

1008
00:50:39,737 --> 00:50:41,227
Back at 2:30.

1009
00:50:42,106 --> 00:50:44,199
So what were their names?

1010
00:50:45,776 --> 00:50:48,006
Their names were Christy and Alice,

1011
00:50:50,447 --> 00:50:53,075
and they wanna have drinks tonight.

1012
00:50:55,286 --> 00:50:58,585
You're not supposed to be in here.
This is a men's room.

1013
00:51:02,626 --> 00:51:03,786
Wow.

1014
00:51:17,808 --> 00:51:19,241
Oh, my God.

1015
00:51:20,144 --> 00:51:21,634
I don't care.

1016
00:51:43,634 --> 00:51:44,828
Hey, man, sorry.

1017
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:47,836
A couple girls are freshening up in there.

1018
00:51:49,006 --> 00:51:50,268
Sweet.

1019
00:51:54,678 --> 00:51:56,407
We have groupies.

1020
00:52:04,922 --> 00:52:06,184
I'll be right back.

1021
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:08,087
Mark, where you going? Mark.

1022
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:14,354
Erica?

1023
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:17,324
Hi.

1024
00:52:17,434 --> 00:52:20,028
I saw you from over there.
I didn't know you came to this club a lot.

1025
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:21,832
- First time.
- Mine, too.

1026
00:52:22,506 --> 00:52:23,803
Could I talk to you alone for a second?

1027
00:52:25,042 --> 00:52:26,270
I think I'm good right here.

1028
00:52:26,343 --> 00:52:30,370
I just... I'd love to talk to you alone
if we could just go someplace.

1029
00:52:30,481 --> 00:52:31,709
Right here is fine.

1030
00:52:32,483 --> 00:52:34,508
I don't know if you heard about
this new website I launched.

1031
00:52:34,618 --> 00:52:35,676
No.

1032
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:39,284
- The Facebook?
- You called me a bitch on the Internet, Mark.

1033
00:52:39,356 --> 00:52:41,187
That's why I wanted to talk to you.

1034
00:52:41,291 --> 00:52:43,282
- On the Internet.
- That's why I came over.

1035
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:44,987
Comparing women to farm animals.

1036
00:52:45,496 --> 00:52:46,963
I didn't end up doing that.

1037
00:52:47,031 --> 00:52:48,692
It didn't stop you from writing it.

1038
00:52:48,799 --> 00:52:51,359
As if every thought that tumbles
through your head was so clever

1039
00:52:51,468 --> 00:52:53,732
it would be a crime for it not to be shared.

1040
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:57,864
The Internet's not written in pencil, Mark,
it's written in ink,

1041
00:52:57,975 --> 00:53:00,876
and you published that Erica Albright
was a bitch,

1042
00:53:00,978 --> 00:53:05,347
right before you made some ignorant crack
about my family's name, my bra size,

1043
00:53:05,416 --> 00:53:07,247
and then rated women
based on their hotness.

1044
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:10,487
- Erica, is there a problem?
- No, there's no problem.

1045
00:53:11,655 --> 00:53:13,680
You write your snide bullshit
from a dark room

1046
00:53:13,757 --> 00:53:16,555
because that's what the angry do nowadays.

1047
00:53:17,528 --> 00:53:19,587
I was nice to you. Don't torture me for it.

1048
00:53:19,697 --> 00:53:21,665
If we could just go somewhere for a minute...

1049
00:53:21,732 --> 00:53:23,927
I don't wanna be rude to my friends.

1050
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:26,434
Okay.

1051
00:53:28,238 --> 00:53:30,604
Good luck with your video game.

1052
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:32,608
Hey, that was great.
That was the right thing to do.

1053
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:34,610
You apologized, right?

1054
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:38,608
We have to expand.

1055
00:53:38,716 --> 00:53:40,115
Sure. Mark?

1056
00:53:42,586 --> 00:53:44,053
Is he mad about something?

1057
00:53:45,122 --> 00:53:47,283
Okay, we are expanding
to Yale and Columbia.

1058
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:49,086
Dustin, I want you to share
the coding work with me.

1059
00:53:49,193 --> 00:53:50,956
Chris, you're gonna be in charge
of publicity and outreach,

1060
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:53,256
and you could start by getting a story
in the BU student newspaper.

1061
00:53:53,363 --> 00:53:54,387
It's <i>The Bridge.</i>

1062
00:53:54,465 --> 00:53:55,727
They hate doing stories about Harvard.

1063
00:53:55,799 --> 00:53:57,733
Somebody at the newspaper
will be a computer science major.

1064
00:53:57,801 --> 00:54:00,235
Tell them that Mark Zuckerberg
will do 10 hours of free programing.

1065
00:54:00,304 --> 00:54:02,033
Why do you want a story
in the BU newspaper?

1066
00:54:02,106 --> 00:54:03,300
Because I do. Now here's the arrangement.

1067
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:05,398
Eduardo is CFO
and owns 30% of the company.

1068
00:54:05,476 --> 00:54:07,034
Dustin is vice president
and head of programing,

1069
00:54:07,111 --> 00:54:09,705
and his 5% of the company
wil come from my end.

1070
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:11,077
Chris is director of publicity,

1071
00:54:11,148 --> 00:54:13,548
and his compensation will depend on
how much work he ends up doing.

1072
00:54:13,617 --> 00:54:14,641
Any questions?

1073
00:54:14,752 --> 00:54:18,313
- Who are the girls?
- Sorry. They're Christy and Alice.

1074
00:54:18,555 --> 00:54:19,715
- Hi.
- Hi.

1075
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:21,223
- Hello.
- Hi.

1076
00:54:21,725 --> 00:54:23,124
Is there anything we can do?

1077
00:54:23,227 --> 00:54:24,285
No, that's it.

1078
00:54:24,394 --> 00:54:26,726
- Yale and Columbia, let's go.
- And Stanford.

1079
00:54:27,431 --> 00:54:29,422
- What?
- Stanford.

1080
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:31,730
It's time for them to see this in Palo Alto.

1081
00:54:37,608 --> 00:54:38,939
You don't want any lunch?

1082
00:54:39,009 --> 00:54:40,101
No.

1083
00:54:40,511 --> 00:54:42,172
You're welcome to some salad.

1084
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:43,803
No, thank you.

1085
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,144
This must be hard.

1086
00:54:52,689 --> 00:54:53,747
Who are you?

1087
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:56,816
I'm Marylin Delpy.
I introduced myself when we first...

1088
00:54:56,927 --> 00:54:58,292
I mean, what do you do?

1089
00:54:58,362 --> 00:55:00,489
I'm a second-year associate at the firm.

1090
00:55:00,597 --> 00:55:03,157
My boss wanted me to sit in
on the deposition phase.

1091
00:55:04,802 --> 00:55:05,962
What are you doing?

1092
00:55:06,036 --> 00:55:09,028
Checking in to see how it's going in Bosnia.

1093
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:10,367
Bosnia.

1094
00:55:10,607 --> 00:55:13,667
They don't have roads,
but they have Facebook.

1095
00:55:18,615 --> 00:55:21,345
You must really hate the Winklevosses.

1096
00:55:22,186 --> 00:55:23,448
I don't hate anybody.

1097
00:55:24,688 --> 00:55:27,953
The Winklevi aren't suing me
for intellectual property theft.

1098
00:55:28,025 --> 00:55:30,550
They are suing me because
for the first time in their lives,

1099
00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:33,061
things didn't work out the way
they were supposed to for them.

1100
00:55:40,537 --> 00:55:42,198
He's expanding.

1101
00:55:42,372 --> 00:55:43,464
What?

1102
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:44,973
He's expanding
to Yale, Columbia and Stanford.

1103
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,199
It's gonna be in <i>The Crimson</i> tomorrow.

1104
00:55:46,310 --> 00:55:47,334
- Really?
- Yep.

1105
00:55:47,477 --> 00:55:50,674
Well, looks like that cease-and-desist letter
realy scared the shit out of him, huh?

1106
00:55:50,747 --> 00:55:54,046
I wanna hire a lawyer to file for injunctive
relief and get the site taken down now.

1107
00:55:54,151 --> 00:55:57,086
Every minute the site is up,
Harvard Connection becomes less valuable.

1108
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:59,985
I want an injunction. I want damages.
I want punitive relief.

1109
00:56:00,057 --> 00:56:01,081
And I want him dead.

1110
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:02,249
Yeah, I want those things, too.

1111
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:03,656
Then why aren't we doing anything about it?

1112
00:56:03,727 --> 00:56:05,024
Because we're gentlemen of Harvard?

1113
00:56:05,095 --> 00:56:06,824
No, it's because you're not thinking
how it's gonna look.

1114
00:56:06,897 --> 00:56:07,921
How's it gonna look?

1115
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:09,225
Like my brother and I
are in skeleton costumes

1116
00:56:09,333 --> 00:56:11,563
chasing the Karate Kid
around a high school gym.

1117
00:56:11,702 --> 00:56:15,263
Cam, he's violated Massachusetts state law.

1118
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:17,203
When he goes to Connecticut,
New York and California,

1119
00:56:17,274 --> 00:56:18,605
he'll have violated federal law.

1120
00:56:18,709 --> 00:56:20,506
And, by the way,
he's in violation of Harvard law.

1121
00:56:20,577 --> 00:56:22,511
There's no such thing as Harvard law.

1122
00:56:22,579 --> 00:56:25,070
Wait. Yeah, there is.

1123
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:31,519
Harvard Student Handbook.

1124
00:56:31,588 --> 00:56:34,386
Every freshman is issued one of these,
and somewhere in this book it says...

1125
00:56:34,458 --> 00:56:35,891
You can't steal from another student.

1126
00:56:37,861 --> 00:56:39,590
This is what we needed.
We're going to Summers.

1127
00:56:39,696 --> 00:56:41,561
Well, you can't get a meeting
with Larry Summers.

1128
00:56:41,932 --> 00:56:43,456
My brother and I,
we pay tuition at this school.

1129
00:56:43,567 --> 00:56:46,764
We carry a 3.9 GPA at this school.
We've won trophies for this school.

1130
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:49,304
And we'll be rowing in the Olympics
for this school.

1131
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:52,864
I want a meeting with
the goddamn president of this school.

1132
00:56:52,943 --> 00:56:54,433
Why Stanford?

1133
00:56:54,578 --> 00:56:56,307
Why do you think?

1134
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:01,949
I'm sorry.

1135
00:57:02,152 --> 00:57:03,619
I'm late for biochem.

1136
00:57:05,289 --> 00:57:06,313
Okay.

1137
00:57:09,126 --> 00:57:10,423
You don't know my name, do you?

1138
00:57:11,128 --> 00:57:12,254
Is it Stanford?

1139
00:57:12,829 --> 00:57:14,922
I should just kick your ass.

1140
00:57:14,998 --> 00:57:17,159
How do you go to a party
and you meet someone...

1141
00:57:17,301 --> 00:57:20,498
Amelia Ritter, but you prefer Amy.
You're from Orinda.

1142
00:57:20,604 --> 00:57:23,767
Your father's in commercial real estate
and your mother's 10 years sober.

1143
00:57:24,174 --> 00:57:25,436
What's my major?

1144
00:57:25,943 --> 00:57:27,501
- Trombone.
- Really?

1145
00:57:28,145 --> 00:57:30,010
I remember something about a trombone.

1146
00:57:33,817 --> 00:57:35,114
French.

1147
00:57:35,185 --> 00:57:36,277
Your major's French.

1148
00:57:36,353 --> 00:57:38,014
- And yours?
- Mine?

1149
00:57:38,155 --> 00:57:40,316
- I don't have one
- You haven't declared?

1150
00:57:41,525 --> 00:57:42,787
I don't go to school.

1151
00:57:42,859 --> 00:57:44,690
- You're kidding.
- No.

1152
00:57:45,028 --> 00:57:47,019
Well, where did you go to school?

1153
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:49,462
William Taft Elementary, for a little while.

1154
00:57:49,533 --> 00:57:50,625
Seriously?

1155
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:53,633
You're not like 15 years old or anything,
are you?

1156
00:57:54,204 --> 00:57:55,364
No.

1157
00:57:56,039 --> 00:57:57,131
Wait, you're not like 15, are you?

1158
00:57:57,207 --> 00:57:58,333
No.

1159
00:58:00,010 --> 00:58:01,534
So, what do you do?

1160
00:58:02,713 --> 00:58:04,305
I'm an entrepreneur.

1161
00:58:04,381 --> 00:58:06,872
- You're unemployed.
- I wouldn't say that.

1162
00:58:06,984 --> 00:58:08,042
What would you say?

1163
00:58:08,185 --> 00:58:09,311
That I'm an entrepreneur.

1164
00:58:09,386 --> 00:58:11,047
Well, then, what was your latest preneur?

1165
00:58:11,188 --> 00:58:15,818
Well, I founded an Internet company that
let folks download and share music for free.

1166
00:58:15,892 --> 00:58:17,223
Kind of like Napster?

1167
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:18,726
Exactly like Napster.

1168
00:58:18,862 --> 00:58:20,489
What do you mean?

1169
00:58:20,564 --> 00:58:21,895
I founded Napster.

1170
00:58:21,999 --> 00:58:23,990
Sean Parker founded Napster.

1171
00:58:24,067 --> 00:58:25,398
Nice to meet you.

1172
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:27,333
You're Sean Parker?

1173
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:29,233
You see, the shoe's on the other...

1174
00:58:29,373 --> 00:58:31,398
- Foot?
- Table, which has turned.

1175
00:58:32,709 --> 00:58:34,233
I just slept with Sean Parker?

1176
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:36,039
You just slept on Sean Parker.

1177
00:58:36,413 --> 00:58:38,677
- You're a zillionaire.
- Not technically.

1178
00:58:38,749 --> 00:58:40,239
What are you?

1179
00:58:40,917 --> 00:58:42,578
Broke. There's not
a lot of money in free music,

1180
00:58:42,686 --> 00:58:46,019
even less when you're being sued by
everyone who's ever been to the Grammys.

1181
00:58:46,089 --> 00:58:47,579
This is blowing my mind.

1182
00:58:47,691 --> 00:58:48,680
I appreciate that.

1183
00:58:48,759 --> 00:58:50,590
I gotta hop in the shower
and get ready for class.

1184
00:58:50,727 --> 00:58:54,094
Biochem, even though you're
a French major whose name is Amy.

1185
00:58:54,598 --> 00:58:55,860
You passed.

1186
00:58:56,233 --> 00:58:57,257
I'm a hard worker.

1187
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:02,600
There's juice or anything else you can find.
Help yourself.

1188
00:59:02,739 --> 00:59:03,763
You mind if I check my e-mail?

1189
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:05,932
Yeah, go ahead.

1190
00:59:15,952 --> 00:59:17,112
Amy!

1191
00:59:19,289 --> 00:59:20,449
Jesus.

1192
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:22,888
- Amy! Can you come out here?
- Yeah?

1193
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,250
Just a second.

1194
00:59:28,265 --> 00:59:29,732
There's a snake in here, Amy.

1195
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:30,892
What?

1196
00:59:33,303 --> 00:59:34,395
Where?

1197
00:59:34,471 --> 00:59:35,904
There isn't a snake,
but I need to ask you something.

1198
00:59:35,972 --> 00:59:37,963
Are you kidding me? I could've been killed.

1199
00:59:38,108 --> 00:59:39,234
How?

1200
00:59:39,309 --> 00:59:43,075
By running too fast
and getting twisted in the curtain.

1201
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,804
What do you need to ask me?

1202
00:59:44,948 --> 00:59:47,746
Yeah, I went to check my e-mail and
there's a website open on your computer.

1203
00:59:48,618 --> 00:59:52,076
Yeah, after you passed out last night
I went on The Facebook for a little bit.

1204
00:59:52,155 --> 00:59:54,316
- What's that?
- The Facebook?

1205
00:59:54,458 --> 00:59:57,427
Stanford's had it for, like, two weeks now.

1206
00:59:57,627 --> 01:00:00,755
It's really awesome,
except it's freakishly addictive.

1207
01:00:00,831 --> 01:00:03,163
Seriously, I'm on the thing
like five times a day.

1208
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:04,756
Mind if I send myself an e-mail?

1209
01:00:04,835 --> 01:00:06,325
Yeah, is everything okay?

1210
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:08,267
Everything's great.

1211
01:00:09,005 --> 01:00:13,271
I just need to find you, Mark Zuckerberg.

1212
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:18,772
I've never been in this building before.

1213
01:00:18,849 --> 01:00:23,183
This building's 100 years older
than the country it's in, so do be careful.

1214
01:00:24,521 --> 01:00:26,182
We're sitting in chairs.

1215
01:00:27,023 --> 01:00:28,149
Yes.

1216
01:00:29,025 --> 01:00:31,357
Very good. You can go in now.

1217
01:00:35,832 --> 01:00:38,630
That's their own stupidity.
I should've been there.

1218
01:00:38,702 --> 01:00:40,294
Well, darkness is the absence of light,

1219
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:43,203
and the stupidity in that instance
was the absence of me.

1220
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:45,205
Catherine I've got students
in my office now.

1221
01:00:45,342 --> 01:00:47,207
Students. Undergrads.

1222
01:00:47,811 --> 01:00:48,800
I don't know.

1223
01:00:48,879 --> 01:00:51,643
From the looks of it, they want
to sell me a Brooks Brothers franchise.

1224
01:00:51,715 --> 01:00:52,977
All right, bye-bye.

1225
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:54,874
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.

1226
01:00:54,985 --> 01:00:56,885
I'm Cameron Winklevoss
and this is my brother, Tyler.

1227
01:00:56,987 --> 01:00:59,046
And you're here because...

1228
01:01:00,524 --> 01:01:01,548
Either of you can answer.

1229
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:03,148
I'm sorry, sir,
I thought you were reading the letter.

1230
01:01:03,226 --> 01:01:04,318
I've read the letter.

1231
01:01:04,394 --> 01:01:07,659
Well, we came up wth an idea for
a website called Harvard Connection...

1232
01:01:07,731 --> 01:01:10,894
We've since changed the name to ConnectU.
And Mark Zuckerberg stole that idea...

1233
01:01:11,034 --> 01:01:12,399
I understand.

1234
01:01:12,536 --> 01:01:15,004
And I'm asking what you want me
to do about it.

1235
01:01:15,071 --> 01:01:19,007
Well, sir, in the Harvard Student Handbook,
which is distributed to each freshman,

1236
01:01:19,075 --> 01:01:21,407
under the heading "Standards of Conduct
in the Harvard Community,"

1237
01:01:21,878 --> 01:01:25,177
it says the college expects all students
to be honest and forthcoming

1238
01:01:25,248 --> 01:01:27,682
in their dealings with members
in this community.

1239
01:01:27,751 --> 01:01:30,242
Students are required to respect
public and private ownership,

1240
01:01:30,887 --> 01:01:32,752
and instances of theft, misappropriation or...

1241
01:01:32,889 --> 01:01:34,356
- Anne?
- Yes, sir?

1242
01:01:34,424 --> 01:01:36,255
Punch me in the face. Go ahead.

1243
01:01:39,229 --> 01:01:43,188
...or unauthorized use
will result in disciplinary action,

1244
01:01:43,266 --> 01:01:45,257
including the requirement
to withdraw from the college.

1245
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:47,427
And you memorized that
instead of doing what?

1246
01:01:47,571 --> 01:01:50,938
What my brother and I came here today
to ask of you, respectfully, of course...

1247
01:01:51,074 --> 01:01:54,202
Sir, it's against university rules to steal
from another student, plain and simple.

1248
01:01:54,277 --> 01:01:55,539
And you've spoken to your House Master?

1249
01:01:55,612 --> 01:01:57,944
Yes, sir. And the House Master made
a recommendation to the Ad Board,

1250
01:01:58,081 --> 01:01:59,605
but the Ad Board won't see us.

1251
01:01:59,749 --> 01:02:01,546
Have you tried dealing with
the other student directly?

1252
01:02:01,618 --> 01:02:04,451
Mr. Zuckerberg hasn't been responding
to any of our e-mails or phone calls

1253
01:02:04,588 --> 01:02:05,612
for the last two weeks.

1254
01:02:05,755 --> 01:02:07,552
He doesn't answer when
we knock on his door at Kirkland,

1255
01:02:07,624 --> 01:02:09,455
and the closest I've come
to dealing with him face-to-face

1256
01:02:09,593 --> 01:02:11,891
is when I saw him on the quad
and chased him through Harvard Square.

1257
01:02:11,962 --> 01:02:13,054
You chased him?

1258
01:02:13,129 --> 01:02:15,723
I saw him and I know he saw me.
I went after him and then he disappeared.

1259
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:19,899
- I don't see this as a university issue.
- Of course this is a university issue.

1260
01:02:19,970 --> 01:02:22,404
There's a code of ethics and an honor code
and he violated them both.

1261
01:02:22,472 --> 01:02:25,930
You enter into a code of ethics with
the university, not with each other.

1262
01:02:26,776 --> 01:02:29,973
I'm sorry, President Summers, but what
you just said makes no sense to me at all.

1263
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:31,240
I'm devastated by that.

1264
01:02:31,314 --> 01:02:33,976
What my brother means is, if
Mark Zuckerberg walked into our dorm room

1265
01:02:34,084 --> 01:02:36,245
and stole our computer,
that would be a university issue.

1266
01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:38,651
I really don't know.
This office doesn't handle petty larceny.

1267
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:40,086
This isnt petty larceny.

1268
01:02:40,156 --> 01:02:42,317
This idea is potentially worth
millions of dollars.

1269
01:02:42,459 --> 01:02:43,585
- Millions?
- Yes.

1270
01:02:43,660 --> 01:02:46,254
You might just be letting
your imaginations run away with you.

1271
01:02:46,329 --> 01:02:49,162
Sir, I honestly don't think you're
in any position to make that call.

1272
01:02:49,266 --> 01:02:53,498
I was the US Treasury Secretary.
I'm in some position to make that call.

1273
01:02:53,637 --> 01:02:54,934
Letting our imaginations run away with us

1274
01:02:55,005 --> 01:02:56,939
is exactly what we were told to do
in your freshman address.

1275
01:02:57,007 --> 01:02:59,999
Well, then I would suggest
that you let your imaginations

1276
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:01,441
run away with you on a new project.

1277
01:03:01,511 --> 01:03:02,671
You would?

1278
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:04,178
Yes. Everyone at Harvard's
inventing something.

1279
01:03:04,314 --> 01:03:08,944
Harvard undergraduates believe that
inventing a job is better than finding a job.

1280
01:03:09,319 --> 01:03:12,777
So I'll suggest again that the two of you
come up with a new new project.

1281
01:03:12,856 --> 01:03:15,950
- I'm sorry, sir, but that's not the point.
- Please, arrive at the point.

1282
01:03:16,026 --> 01:03:17,789
You don't have to be
an intellectual property expert

1283
01:03:17,861 --> 01:03:19,351
to understand the difference
between right and wrong.

1284
01:03:19,496 --> 01:03:21,293
And you're saying that I don't?

1285
01:03:21,364 --> 01:03:23,355
- Of course I'm not saying that, sir.
- I'm saying that.

1286
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:25,161
- Really?
- Sir.

1287
01:03:25,368 --> 01:03:27,302
Anne, how did they get this appointment?

1288
01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:29,304
Colleagues of their father.

1289
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:33,138
Let me tell you something,
Mr Winklevoss, Mr. Winklevoss,

1290
01:03:33,209 --> 01:03:35,643
since you're on the subject
of right and wrong.

1291
01:03:35,712 --> 01:03:39,978
This action, this meeting,
the two of you being here is wrong.

1292
01:03:40,216 --> 01:03:43,549
It's not worthy of Harvard.
It's not what Harvard saw in you.

1293
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:46,053
You don't get special treatment.

1294
01:03:46,222 --> 01:03:48,656
- We never asked...
- Just start another project?

1295
01:03:48,725 --> 01:03:50,556
Like we're making a diorama
for a science fair?

1296
01:03:50,694 --> 01:03:52,161
If you have a problem
with that, Mr. Winklevoss...

1297
01:03:52,228 --> 01:03:53,320
We never asked for special treatment.

1298
01:03:53,396 --> 01:03:57,059
...the courts are always at your disposal.
Is there anything else I can do for you?

1299
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:58,827
You can take the Harvard
Student Handbook and shove it...

1300
01:03:58,902 --> 01:03:59,994
Ty.

1301
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:02,865
Thank you very much for your time, sir.

1302
01:04:08,078 --> 01:04:09,375
Whoops.

1303
01:04:09,579 --> 01:04:12,070
Broke your 335-year-old doorknob.

1304
01:04:13,717 --> 01:04:16,845
Eduardo, spring break, you
and Mr. Zuckerberg took a trip to New York.

1305
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:19,514
- Yes.
- What was the purpose of the trip?

1306
01:04:19,589 --> 01:04:23,252
Well, as CFO, I had set up some meetings
with potential advertisers.

1307
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:25,084
Who paid for the trip?

1308
01:04:25,195 --> 01:04:28,255
It was paid for out of the $1,000 account
I had set up a few months earlier.

1309
01:04:28,398 --> 01:04:32,198
At this point, your $1,000 was the only
money that had been put into the company?

1310
01:04:32,268 --> 01:04:34,259
- Yes.
- How did you feel the meetings went?

1311
01:04:35,772 --> 01:04:37,865
- They went terribly.
- Why?

1312
01:04:38,074 --> 01:04:39,200
Mark was asleep.

1313
01:04:39,275 --> 01:04:40,708
I was not asleep.

1314
01:04:40,777 --> 01:04:42,108
Can I rephrase my answer?

1315
01:04:42,278 --> 01:04:44,269
I wish he'd been asleep.

1316
01:04:47,083 --> 01:04:50,575
So we're in 29 schools now,
with over 75,000 members.

1317
01:04:51,421 --> 01:04:52,547
People who go on The Facebook

1318
01:04:52,622 --> 01:04:55,056
tend to stay on longer
than almost any other website.

1319
01:04:55,125 --> 01:04:56,888
Now, here's the most impressive statstic.

1320
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:59,952
91% of people who try it once
will come back.

1321
01:05:00,063 --> 01:05:01,928
- Now, if you'll allow me...
- Excuse me one second.

1322
01:05:02,065 --> 01:05:04,397
What sound is he making? Is that like a tsk?

1323
01:05:07,404 --> 01:05:09,065
It wasn't a tsk.

1324
01:05:09,239 --> 01:05:10,570
It was...

1325
01:05:11,474 --> 01:05:13,305
Like a glottal stop.

1326
01:05:13,810 --> 01:05:15,641
Almost a gag reflex.

1327
01:05:17,247 --> 01:05:18,976
Guys, what is this?

1328
01:05:19,082 --> 01:05:21,744
There was one more meeting scheduled
for the New York trip.

1329
01:05:21,818 --> 01:05:23,149
Yes, it was a dinner.

1330
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:24,652
It was set up through
my girlfriend at the time.

1331
01:05:24,821 --> 01:05:27,813
Would you say that Mark was
excited about this meeting?

1332
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:30,154
Yes. Very.

1333
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:32,251
- Look, they're not gonna card us.
- They might.

1334
01:05:32,328 --> 01:05:34,159
- I mean, look around
- It'll be embarrassing.

1335
01:05:34,297 --> 01:05:37,095
- Tell him they're not gonna card us.
- They're not gonna card us.

1336
01:05:37,167 --> 01:05:39,101
- Mark...
- Are you gonna talk about ads again?

1337
01:05:39,169 --> 01:05:40,932
Unless you're the ballet theater of Hartford,

1338
01:05:41,004 --> 01:05:42,995
the purpose of a business
is to make a profit.

1339
01:05:43,106 --> 01:05:44,266
It isn't a business yet.

1340
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:48,140
That's tough for me, 'cause my...
Never mind.

1341
01:05:51,147 --> 01:05:52,512
He's 25 minutes late.

1342
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:55,345
He founded Napster when he was 19.
He can be late.

1343
01:05:55,485 --> 01:05:57,112
- He's not a god.
- Then what is he?

1344
01:05:57,187 --> 01:05:58,677
He's 25 minutes late.

1345
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:00,016
I think Wardo's jealous.

1346
01:06:00,190 --> 01:06:03,318
I honestly wasn't jealous. I was nervous.

1347
01:06:03,526 --> 01:06:04,515
Why?

1348
01:06:04,661 --> 01:06:08,119
Well, I didn't know him at all, but I had
done a search and I'd asked around.

1349
01:06:08,198 --> 01:06:11,497
And he struck me as kind of a...

1350
01:06:13,369 --> 01:06:14,836
A wild card.

1351
01:06:15,038 --> 01:06:16,027
Why?

1352
01:06:16,172 --> 01:06:19,471
He crashed out of two pretty big
Internet companies in spectacular fashion,

1353
01:06:19,542 --> 01:06:20,975
he's had a reputation with drugs...

1354
01:06:21,044 --> 01:06:22,306
He also founded the companies.

1355
01:06:22,378 --> 01:06:23,709
We don't need him.

1356
01:06:24,347 --> 01:06:25,371
He's here.

1357
01:06:28,551 --> 01:06:30,143
No, no, take your time.

1358
01:06:30,220 --> 01:06:32,984
- And he does own a watch.
- Stop it.

1359
01:06:34,858 --> 01:06:36,052
- I'm Sean Parker.
- How do you do?

1360
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:39,060
You must be Eduardo. And Christy.
And Mark.

1361
01:06:39,195 --> 01:06:41,163
- Great to meet you.
- Great to meet you.

1362
01:06:41,231 --> 01:06:42,721
You guys don't have anything
in front of you.

1363
01:06:42,866 --> 01:06:43,890
- No.
- Tori.

1364
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:44,989
We were waiting.

1365
01:06:45,068 --> 01:06:47,229
- Hey, baby boy.
- Can you bring out some things?

1366
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:50,168
The lacquered pork with that ginger confit.
Tuna tartare?

1367
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:52,071
And the lobster claws, that'll get us started.

1368
01:06:52,208 --> 01:06:54,073
Christy, what do you like to drink?

1369
01:06:55,712 --> 01:06:56,906
An appletini.

1370
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:59,038
Great. Four of those.

1371
01:06:59,749 --> 01:07:02,411
From that point on, it was a Seanathon.

1372
01:07:11,261 --> 01:07:13,923
The question was,
"What did you talk about?"

1373
01:07:25,408 --> 01:07:27,706
He took us through his episode
with Napster.

1374
01:07:27,777 --> 01:07:30,769
I didn't wanna spend my 20s
as a professional defendant.

1375
01:07:30,914 --> 01:07:33,940
Who knew? The music industry
doesn't have a sense of humor.

1376
01:07:34,083 --> 01:07:37,280
We tried to sell the company to pay the
35 million they said we owed in royalties,

1377
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:41,880
but I guess to them that was a little like
selling a stolen car to pay for the stolen gas.

1378
01:07:42,592 --> 01:07:45,060
So we said screw it, declared bankruptcy.

1379
01:07:45,128 --> 01:07:47,790
- But you made a name for yourself.
- And you are dry.

1380
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:49,626
- Tori!
- No, no, I'm good.

1381
01:07:49,732 --> 01:07:51,927
And then he went on to
his second business venture,

1382
01:07:52,468 --> 01:07:55,631
which was an online Rolodex that
he got thrown out of by Case Equity.

1383
01:07:55,972 --> 01:07:57,735
And I wanted to do it nice this time.

1384
01:07:58,141 --> 01:08:01,736
I put on a tie and I shined my shoes,
but nobody wants to take orders from a kid.

1385
01:08:01,811 --> 01:08:04,746
So let me tell you what happens to
a 20-year-old at the top of a hot dot-com.

1386
01:08:04,814 --> 01:08:07,977
- I'm not a psychiatrist, but...
- I'm glad we've got that on the record.

1387
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:10,314
You're not a psychiatrist, but what?

1388
01:08:10,453 --> 01:08:13,286
A psychiatrist would say
that he was paranoid.

1389
01:08:13,489 --> 01:08:15,923
They'll hire private detectives
who'll follow you day and night.

1390
01:08:15,992 --> 01:08:18,085
You're a target for high-priced escorts.

1391
01:08:18,161 --> 01:08:20,493
I can't prove it,
but I know they tap my phones.

1392
01:08:20,630 --> 01:08:23,155
Whatever it is that's gonna trip you up,
you've done already.

1393
01:08:23,299 --> 01:08:25,824
Private behavior is a relic
of a time gone by.

1394
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:28,768
And if somehow, someway, youve managed
to live your life like the Dalai Lama,

1395
01:08:28,838 --> 01:08:29,998
they'll make shit up.

1396
01:08:30,139 --> 01:08:32,664
Because they don't want you,
they want your idea.

1397
01:08:33,009 --> 01:08:34,499
And they want you
to say "thank you" while you...

1398
01:08:34,978 --> 01:08:36,002
Excuse me.

1399
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:37,511
...wipe your chin and walk away.

1400
01:08:37,647 --> 01:08:38,671
That's what happened to you?

1401
01:08:38,815 --> 01:08:40,339
And delusional.

1402
01:08:41,017 --> 01:08:44,111
Yes. But there'll be payback at Case.

1403
01:08:44,187 --> 01:08:45,779
I brought down the record companies
with Napster

1404
01:08:45,855 --> 01:08:47,186
and Case'll suffer for their sins, too.

1405
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:49,781
Sorry, you didnt bring down
the record companies.

1406
01:08:50,193 --> 01:08:51,182
They won.

1407
01:08:51,361 --> 01:08:53,022
- In court.
- Yeah.

1408
01:08:53,363 --> 01:08:55,957
You wanna buy a Tower Records, Eduardo?

1409
01:08:58,368 --> 01:09:01,804
And he told story after story
about life in Silicon Valley,

1410
01:09:01,871 --> 01:09:05,864
and parties at Stanford and down in LA,
and friends who'd become millionaires...

1411
01:09:06,009 --> 01:09:10,878
But mostly how Mark had to...
He had to come to California.

1412
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:14,146
And then he got around to The Facebook.

1413
01:09:14,217 --> 01:09:16,708
So, tell me about your progress.

1414
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:20,380
Well, we're in 29 schools now.
We got over 75,000 members.

1415
01:09:20,556 --> 01:09:22,217
- Tell me about the strategy you're using.
- Okay.

1416
01:09:22,392 --> 01:09:24,326
For instance, we wanted Baylor, in Texas,

1417
01:09:24,394 --> 01:09:26,225
but Baylor already had
a social network on campus.

1418
01:09:26,362 --> 01:09:27,886
So instead of going right after them,

1419
01:09:28,031 --> 01:09:30,056
we made a list of every school
wthin 100 miles...

1420
01:09:30,199 --> 01:09:31,223
You put The Facebook
on those campuses first.

1421
01:09:31,334 --> 01:09:34,167
Pretty soon all the Baylor kids saw
their friends on our site and we were in.

1422
01:09:34,237 --> 01:09:35,568
It's called the Little Bighorn.
That's smart, Mark.

1423
01:09:35,705 --> 01:09:37,070
- Thanks, that was mine.
- Easy.

1424
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:38,902
Hey, you know what?
Settle an argument for us.

1425
01:09:39,042 --> 01:09:40,907
I say it's time to start making money
from The Facebook,

1426
01:09:41,044 --> 01:09:42,909
but Mark doesn't want advertising.
Who's right?

1427
01:09:43,012 --> 01:09:44,240
Well...

1428
01:09:44,914 --> 01:09:46,176
Neither of you yet.

1429
01:09:46,249 --> 01:09:48,581
The Facebook is cool,
that's what it's got going for it.

1430
01:09:48,718 --> 01:09:49,742
Yeah.

1431
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:51,513
You don't wanna ruin it with ads
because ads aren't cool.

1432
01:09:51,587 --> 01:09:52,679
Exactly.

1433
01:09:52,755 --> 01:09:54,245
It's like you're throwing
the greatest party on campus

1434
01:09:54,357 --> 01:09:55,585
and someone's saying
it's gotta be over by 11:00.

1435
01:09:55,725 --> 01:09:56,749
That's exactly right.

1436
01:09:56,859 --> 01:09:59,020
- You don't even know what the thing is yet.
- Exactly.

1437
01:09:59,095 --> 01:10:02,826
How big it can get, how far it can go.
This is no time to take your chips down.

1438
01:10:02,899 --> 01:10:04,833
A million dollars isn't cool.
You know what's cool?

1439
01:10:04,901 --> 01:10:05,925
You?

1440
01:10:08,738 --> 01:10:10,069
"A billion dollars."

1441
01:10:13,710 --> 01:10:15,268
And that shut everybody up.

1442
01:10:15,378 --> 01:10:18,438
And that's where you're headed.
A billion-dollar valuation.

1443
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:21,877
Unless you take bad advice, in which case
you may as well have come up with

1444
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:23,782
a chain of very successful yogurt shops.

1445
01:10:24,353 --> 01:10:28,016
When you go fishing, you can catch
a lot of fish or you can catch a big fish.

1446
01:10:28,091 --> 01:10:31,390
You ever walk into a guy's den and see
a picture of him standing next to 14 trout?

1447
01:10:31,461 --> 01:10:33,292
- No, he's holding a 3,000-pound marlin.
- Yep.

1448
01:10:33,396 --> 01:10:34,454
- That's a good analogy.
- Okay.

1449
01:10:34,564 --> 01:10:36,930
But we all know marlins don't really
weigh 3,000 pounds, right?

1450
01:10:37,033 --> 01:10:38,057
Have you seen the big ones up close?

1451
01:10:38,134 --> 01:10:41,103
No, but I don't think the guy's holding
a marlin the size of a Range Rover.

1452
01:10:41,204 --> 01:10:43,798
That would be a realy big fish
and a very strong guy.

1453
01:10:43,906 --> 01:10:45,430
You think we might be getting away
from the point?

1454
01:10:45,541 --> 01:10:49,807
I don't have a dog in this fight.
I'm just a fan who came to say hi.

1455
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:51,743
He owned Mark after that dinner.

1456
01:10:52,648 --> 01:10:55,048
He picked up the check,
he told Mark they'd talk again soon,

1457
01:10:55,118 --> 01:10:56,210
and he was gone.

1458
01:10:56,285 --> 01:11:00,153
But not before he made his biggest
contribution to the company.

1459
01:11:02,558 --> 01:11:04,992
Drop the "The." Just "Facebook."

1460
01:11:05,595 --> 01:11:07,119
It's cleaner.

1461
01:11:10,066 --> 01:11:11,090
Shit.

1462
01:11:13,803 --> 01:11:14,827
Goodbye, sweetie.

1463
01:11:15,905 --> 01:11:17,099
Yeah.

1464
01:11:20,977 --> 01:11:23,912
That's gotta be some kind of
land speed record for talking.

1465
01:11:23,980 --> 01:11:26,141
You wanna end the party at 11:00.

1466
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:30,347
- I'm trying to pay for the party.
- There won't be a party unless it's cool.

1467
01:11:31,587 --> 01:11:32,645
So, what do you think?

1468
01:11:32,755 --> 01:11:34,689
Yeah, sure, let's drop the "The."

1469
01:11:34,791 --> 01:11:37,919
I meant to catching the marlin
instead of the 14 trout.

1470
01:11:37,994 --> 01:11:39,291
Doesn't that sound good?

1471
01:11:39,362 --> 01:11:41,091
If you're a trout.

1472
01:11:41,264 --> 01:11:42,697
I'm going to enter this into the record.

1473
01:11:42,799 --> 01:11:46,701
Incorporation papers for Facebook,
an LLC registered in Florida.

1474
01:11:46,803 --> 01:11:48,862
- Why Florida?
- It's where my family lives.

1475
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:51,531
And ask the respondent to stipulate
that the articles of incorporation

1476
01:11:51,707 --> 01:11:55,370
state the ownership as follows:
65% for Mark Zuckerberg,

1477
01:11:55,478 --> 01:11:58,606
30% for Eduardo Saverin
and 5% for Dustin Moskovitz.

1478
01:11:58,681 --> 01:11:59,773
Yeah, we stipulate.

1479
01:11:59,849 --> 01:12:02,716
- And that was April 13th, 2004.
- You can mark it.

1480
01:12:02,819 --> 01:12:04,446
You have anything here?

1481
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:05,817
Yes. Thank you.

1482
01:12:05,888 --> 01:12:08,618
Mr Saverin, have you ever done anything

1483
01:12:08,691 --> 01:12:11,285
that might be considered
legitimate grounds fortermination?

1484
01:12:13,129 --> 01:12:14,153
No.

1485
01:12:14,230 --> 01:12:18,792
You never did anything to embarrass the
company or even seriously jeopardize it?

1486
01:12:19,402 --> 01:12:20,801
- No.
- No?

1487
01:12:24,373 --> 01:12:25,397
No.

1488
01:12:25,508 --> 01:12:27,669
You were acoused of animal cruelty.

1489
01:12:29,245 --> 01:12:31,713
- Wait.
- You weren't?

1490
01:12:31,814 --> 01:12:34,044
This is not happening.

1491
01:12:34,150 --> 01:12:36,482
I have here an article from <i>The Crimson</i>...

1492
01:12:36,552 --> 01:12:37,644
Jesus Christ.

1493
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:38,744
I can't have this, Wardo.

1494
01:12:38,855 --> 01:12:42,313
Come on, man. This is bullshit.
This is another club playing a prank.

1495
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:46,090
I'd gotten into the Phoenix.

1496
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:48,823
I'd been accepted,
and as part of my initiation I had to,

1497
01:12:48,898 --> 01:12:52,891
for one week, carry with me at all times
and take care of a chicken.

1498
01:12:53,002 --> 01:12:55,596
They identify you
as one of the founders of Facebook.

1499
01:12:55,705 --> 01:12:57,070
"Junior Eduardo Saverin..."

1500
01:12:57,173 --> 01:12:59,107
I'm not the expert, but being connected
to torturing animals

1501
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:00,539
is probably bad for business.

1502
01:13:00,610 --> 01:13:05,445
I did not torture the chicken.
I don't torture chickens. Are you crazy?

1503
01:13:05,548 --> 01:13:09,382
No, and settle down, please
I have here an article from <i>The Crimson...</i>

1504
01:13:09,452 --> 01:13:11,249
- This is scathing.
- 956.

1505
01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:14,184
I was having dinner in
the Kirkland dining hall with Mark,

1506
01:13:14,590 --> 01:13:15,955
and I had the chicken with me,

1507
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:18,049
because I had to have the chicken
with me at all times.

1508
01:13:18,127 --> 01:13:19,219
This was college.

1509
01:13:19,295 --> 01:13:21,388
- Somebody's gonna have to answer for this.
- 969.

1510
01:13:21,864 --> 01:13:24,025
And the dining hall
was serving chicken for dinner,

1511
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:26,534
and I had to feed my chicken, so I...

1512
01:13:26,602 --> 01:13:29,799
Well, I took little pieces of chicken
and I gave it to the chicken.

1513
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:32,067
Someone must have seen me,
because the next thing I knew

1514
01:13:32,141 --> 01:13:33,870
I was being accused of forced cannibalism.

1515
01:13:34,810 --> 01:13:37,301
I didnt know you couldn't do that.

1516
01:13:37,747 --> 01:13:39,738
I dealt wth the various animal rights groups,

1517
01:13:39,815 --> 01:13:42,045
I dealt with the assocate dean
of the college.

1518
01:13:42,318 --> 01:13:43,979
This was all resolved.

1519
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:45,110
988.

1520
01:13:45,221 --> 01:13:47,246
Someone from the Porc or the Fly
must have reported t.

1521
01:13:47,323 --> 01:13:49,154
For all I know, it was the Winklevosses.

1522
01:13:49,258 --> 01:13:50,953
All right, let's just forget about it.

1523
01:13:51,060 --> 01:13:53,995
This is absurd.
I'm being accused of animal cruelty.

1524
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:55,563
It's better to be accused of necrophilia.

1525
01:13:55,631 --> 01:13:57,258
It is betterto be accused of necrophilia.

1526
01:13:57,333 --> 01:14:00,734
Now I have to explain this to my father.
I'm gonna have to explain this to everybody.

1527
01:14:00,803 --> 01:14:02,236
What is happening on that?

1528
01:14:02,305 --> 01:14:04,398
I have my final coming up
for Postwar and Contemporary Art

1529
01:14:04,473 --> 01:14:05,735
and I haven't been to class.

1530
01:14:05,808 --> 01:14:07,070
I'm supposed to write about
these four paintings.

1531
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:08,774
That's a Facebook page?

1532
01:14:08,844 --> 01:14:09,902
Yeah. I opened it under an alias.

1533
01:14:09,979 --> 01:14:11,412
I posted the paintings
and asked people to comment.

1534
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:14,472
Every once in a while I hop on
and stir the pot to get a good debate going.

1535
01:14:14,583 --> 01:14:16,983
Mr. Zuckerberg was cheating
on his final exam?

1536
01:14:17,086 --> 01:14:19,850
- I'd rather not answer that, Gretchen.
- And why not?

1537
01:14:19,956 --> 01:14:22,686
Because I'm not suing him
for cheating on his final exam.

1538
01:14:22,792 --> 01:14:25,955
- That's not what friends do.
- Well, you just told us he was cheating.

1539
01:14:26,862 --> 01:14:27,920
Oops.

1540
01:14:30,266 --> 01:14:32,200
You told your lawyers
I was torturing animals?

1541
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:33,928
No, he didn't tell us about it at all.

1542
01:14:34,003 --> 01:14:36,767
Our litigators are capable
of finding a <i>Crimson</i> article.

1543
01:14:36,839 --> 01:14:39,535
In fact, when we raised the subject with him,
he defended you.

1544
01:14:42,011 --> 01:14:43,035
Oops.

1545
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:45,504
993. We are so close.

1546
01:14:46,148 --> 01:14:49,311
Yeah, that reminds me,
we're gonna need more money, Wardo.

1547
01:14:49,385 --> 01:14:51,444
Yeah, no, I agree. More servers, more help.

1548
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:53,283
I'm interviewing two interns
to come to Palo Alto

1549
01:14:53,356 --> 01:14:54,448
and we're gonna have
to pay them something.

1550
01:14:54,523 --> 01:14:56,491
- Sorry, what?
- I already found a house for rent

1551
01:14:56,559 --> 01:14:58,322
on a street
two blocks from the Stanford campus.

1552
01:14:58,394 --> 01:14:59,725
It is perfect and it's got a pool.

1553
01:14:59,829 --> 01:15:01,820
When did you decide to go to California
for the summer?

1554
01:15:01,897 --> 01:15:03,159
You mean when did I actually decide?

1555
01:15:03,232 --> 01:15:06,395
Was it somewhere in the middle
of the Sean Parker Variety Hour?

1556
01:15:06,836 --> 01:15:09,031
He was right,
California's the place we've gotta be.

1557
01:15:09,138 --> 01:15:10,537
What, you're Jed Clampett?

1558
01:15:10,639 --> 01:15:12,664
I didn't know you guys
got <i>The Beverly Hillbillies</i> in Brazil.

1559
01:15:12,742 --> 01:15:14,403
Yeah, got the show in Brazil, it was genius.

1560
01:15:14,877 --> 01:15:17,846
- What is your problem with Sean?
- He doesn't bring anything to the table.

1561
01:15:17,913 --> 01:15:19,972
He doesn't have money.
Dustin's a better programmer.

1562
01:15:20,049 --> 01:15:23,644
- He's got connections to VCs.
- We don't need VCs, we need advertisers.

1563
01:15:23,719 --> 01:15:25,653
- And I have connections to VCs.
- No real players.

1564
01:15:25,721 --> 01:15:28,315
And as somebody who's just really
embarrassed the company in a bad way...

1565
01:15:28,391 --> 01:15:30,586
- It was the Winklevosses, Mark.
- Hang on.

1566
01:15:30,693 --> 01:15:32,160
Hit "Refresh."

1567
01:15:32,862 --> 01:15:35,990
150,004.

1568
01:15:36,065 --> 01:15:38,431
150,000 members, Wardo.

1569
01:15:38,834 --> 01:15:40,165
- Congratulations, dude.
- Congratulations.

1570
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:44,704
You don't think it was strange that
he was followed by private detectives?

1571
01:15:44,774 --> 01:15:46,435
Who came up with nothing.

1572
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:48,510
Enough to get him out of the company.
The drugs, the girls.

1573
01:15:48,577 --> 01:15:50,704
- We don't know that any of that's true.
- You can read about it.

1574
01:15:50,780 --> 01:15:52,338
I can read about you torturing birds.
Since when...

1575
01:15:52,415 --> 01:15:56,078
Okay, don't fish eat other fish?
The marlins and the trout?

1576
01:15:58,587 --> 01:15:59,611
What's he talking about?

1577
01:15:59,722 --> 01:16:02,384
I'm interviewing interns at 10:00
tomorrow night in the CS lab.

1578
01:16:02,458 --> 01:16:03,618
Get on board with this, man.

1579
01:16:03,726 --> 01:16:06,251
You know, I don't really know
what else to say.

1580
01:16:29,618 --> 01:16:31,984
You can do one more! One more!

1581
01:16:36,725 --> 01:16:37,749
Wardo!

1582
01:16:37,827 --> 01:16:39,124
Yo! Mark!

1583
01:16:41,063 --> 01:16:42,087
What's going on?

1584
01:16:42,164 --> 01:16:44,564
They have 10 minutes to get root access
to a Python web server,

1585
01:16:44,633 --> 01:16:45,930
expose its SSL encryption,

1586
01:16:46,001 --> 01:16:47,628
and then intercept all traffic
over its secure port.

1587
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:48,794
They're hacking.

1588
01:16:48,938 --> 01:16:50,929
Yes, all behind a Px Firewall Emulator.
But here's the beauty.

1589
01:16:51,006 --> 01:16:52,837
You know I didn't understand
anything you just said, right?

1590
01:16:52,942 --> 01:16:54,068
- I do know that.
- So what's the beauty?

1591
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:56,077
Every tenth line of code written,
they have to drink a shot.

1592
01:16:56,145 --> 01:16:59,137
Hacking's supposed to be stealth,
so every time the server detects an intrusion,

1593
01:16:59,248 --> 01:17:01,079
the candidate responsible
has to drink a shot.

1594
01:17:01,150 --> 01:17:02,845
I also have a program running
that has a pop-up window

1595
01:17:02,952 --> 01:17:04,783
appear simultaneously on all five computers.

1596
01:17:04,854 --> 01:17:06,845
The last candidate to hit the window
has to drink a shot.

1597
01:17:06,956 --> 01:17:09,083
Plus, every three minutes
they all have to drink a shot.

1598
01:17:09,158 --> 01:17:11,626
- Three minutes!
- Drink one now!

1599
01:17:11,694 --> 01:17:15,323
Hey, can I ask, what part of the intern's job
will they need to be able to do drunk?

1600
01:17:15,431 --> 01:17:16,455
You're right.

1601
01:17:16,532 --> 01:17:19,831
A more relevant test might be seeing
if they can keep a chicken alive for a week.

1602
01:17:21,637 --> 01:17:23,537
- That was mean.
- Here.

1603
01:17:23,706 --> 01:17:24,764
What is this?

1604
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:27,934
I opened a new account
and put $18,000 in it.

1605
01:17:29,378 --> 01:17:31,278
Will that get you through the summer?

1606
01:17:31,347 --> 01:17:32,371
- Here!
- Mark?

1607
01:17:32,481 --> 01:17:33,880
Right here!

1608
01:17:39,054 --> 01:17:40,885
Welcome to Facebook.

1609
01:17:50,299 --> 01:17:51,994
- $18,000?
- Yes.

1610
01:17:52,067 --> 01:17:54,399
In addition to the $1,000
you'd already put up.

1611
01:17:54,503 --> 01:17:57,063
- Yes.
- A total of $19,000 now.

1612
01:17:57,173 --> 01:17:58,401
- Yes.
- Hang on.

1613
01:18:00,576 --> 01:18:02,043
I'm just checking your math on that.

1614
01:18:02,144 --> 01:18:04,476
Yes, I got the same thing.

1615
01:18:05,047 --> 01:18:06,139
May I continue?

1616
01:18:06,715 --> 01:18:09,650
After expressing misgivings
about Mr. Zuckerberg taking the company

1617
01:18:09,718 --> 01:18:11,743
and moving it to California forthe summer,

1618
01:18:11,854 --> 01:18:14,846
why did you put $18,000
in an account for his use?

1619
01:18:14,924 --> 01:18:18,690
I figured we were partners.
I wanted to be a team player.

1620
01:18:18,761 --> 01:18:21,855
I figured Mark Dustin and the new interns
could work on the site

1621
01:18:21,931 --> 01:18:24,399
while I was generating
advertiser interest in New York.

1622
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:29,028
But mosty I figured, how much could
possibly go wrong in three months?

1623
01:18:30,839 --> 01:18:32,602
Go, go, go, go, go.

1624
01:18:37,213 --> 01:18:38,840
- I didn't die.
- I know.

1625
01:18:38,914 --> 01:18:40,745
- I made it.
- You did.

1626
01:18:42,184 --> 01:18:43,515
Okay, ready?

1627
01:18:43,586 --> 01:18:45,850
- That was like an 8.
- That was like a 2.

1628
01:18:45,921 --> 01:18:48,287
- It was better than that.
- Yeah.

1629
01:18:56,966 --> 01:18:58,024
I'm okay.

1630
01:18:58,100 --> 01:18:59,362
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1631
01:18:59,969 --> 01:19:01,061
Yikes.

1632
01:19:02,438 --> 01:19:03,803
That's the doorbell.

1633
01:19:03,906 --> 01:19:05,100
I didn't know we had a doorbell.

1634
01:19:05,207 --> 01:19:07,903
- Andrew, get the door!
- No, he's wired in.

1635
01:19:07,977 --> 01:19:09,968
That's gonna cut into your security deposit.

1636
01:19:12,081 --> 01:19:13,139
- Andrew.
- Not now.

1637
01:19:13,249 --> 01:19:14,580
Good boy.

1638
01:19:18,721 --> 01:19:20,052
- Sean?
- Mark?

1639
01:19:20,122 --> 01:19:22,090
- Do you live here?
- Yeah.

1640
01:19:22,391 --> 01:19:23,415
Do you?

1641
01:19:23,492 --> 01:19:25,050
We were right across the street.
We saw the chimney...

1642
01:19:25,127 --> 01:19:27,721
- Is anybody hurt?
- No. You live across the street?

1643
01:19:29,131 --> 01:19:30,291
I'm Sharon.

1644
01:19:30,399 --> 01:19:32,731
This is my... Sharon.
She lives across the street.

1645
01:19:32,835 --> 01:19:34,132
I was helping her move out,
we saw the chimney...

1646
01:19:34,236 --> 01:19:36,170
We had a zip line to the pool.

1647
01:19:37,072 --> 01:19:39,506
You came to California.

1648
01:19:40,009 --> 01:19:40,998
Yeah.

1649
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:43,237
You made the right choice.

1650
01:19:49,184 --> 01:19:50,173
Here you go.

1651
01:19:54,857 --> 01:19:55,915
Sharon?

1652
01:19:58,360 --> 01:19:59,349
I'm so sorry.

1653
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:00,485
- No problem.
- I didn't know you were gonna...

1654
01:20:00,596 --> 01:20:02,621
- Here you go.
- No, no, no. Wait!

1655
01:20:04,033 --> 01:20:08,094
This house and this team are great.
It's exacty what it should be.

1656
01:20:08,871 --> 01:20:10,202
I'm Sean Parker.

1657
01:20:10,306 --> 01:20:11,432
Oh, he's wired in.

1658
01:20:11,974 --> 01:20:13,635
That's what I'm talking about.

1659
01:20:15,210 --> 01:20:16,336
Where's Eduardo?

1660
01:20:16,445 --> 01:20:18,936
He got an internship in New York.

1661
01:20:19,615 --> 01:20:20,980
Eduardo didn't come out?

1662
01:20:41,570 --> 01:20:44,300
I was crashing there for a little bit
while I'm taking care of some things,

1663
01:20:44,406 --> 01:20:47,842
but she's done for the summer
so she's back at her parents' place.

1664
01:20:47,910 --> 01:20:51,368
- The homeless rock star of Palo Alto.
- All right.

1665
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:53,914
What's your plan for the summer?

1666
01:20:55,084 --> 01:20:56,312
Mark?

1667
01:20:56,919 --> 01:20:59,080
I'm sorry. I was looking at the architecture.

1668
01:21:00,422 --> 01:21:01,753
I asked what your plan for the...

1669
01:21:01,857 --> 01:21:03,347
A hundred schools
by the end of the summer.

1670
01:21:03,425 --> 01:21:05,188
- We're gonna go to the restroom.
- Okay.

1671
01:21:05,327 --> 01:21:07,318
Yeah, I'll go with you.

1672
01:21:10,933 --> 01:21:12,423
Your date looks so familiar to me.

1673
01:21:12,534 --> 01:21:14,092
She looks familiar to a lot of people.

1674
01:21:14,203 --> 01:21:15,431
What do you mean?

1675
01:21:17,439 --> 01:21:20,840
A Stanford MBA named Roy Raymond
wants to buy his wife some lingerie,

1676
01:21:20,943 --> 01:21:23,741
but he's too embarrassed
to shop for it in a department store.

1677
01:21:23,846 --> 01:21:25,677
He comes up with an idea
for a high-end place

1678
01:21:25,781 --> 01:21:28,079
that doesn't make you feel like a pervert.

1679
01:21:28,183 --> 01:21:32,176
He gets a $40,000 bank loan,
borrows another 40,000 from his in-laws,

1680
01:21:32,287 --> 01:21:35,256
opens a store and calls it Victoria's Secret.

1681
01:21:35,357 --> 01:21:38,053
Makes a half million dollars his first year.

1682
01:21:38,127 --> 01:21:41,961
Starts a catalog, opens three more stores,
and after five years, he sells the company

1683
01:21:42,064 --> 01:21:45,295
to Leslie Wexner and The Limited
for $4 million.

1684
01:21:45,467 --> 01:21:46,627
Happy ending, right?

1685
01:21:47,202 --> 01:21:51,434
Except two years later,
the company's worth $500 million,

1686
01:21:51,540 --> 01:21:54,805
and Roy Raymond jumps off
the Golden Gate Bridge.

1687
01:21:57,045 --> 01:22:00,811
Poor guy just wanted to buy his wife
a pair of thigh-highs, you know?

1688
01:22:01,984 --> 01:22:03,417
Was that a parable?

1689
01:22:04,219 --> 01:22:08,417
My date's a Victoria's Secret model.
That's why she looks familiar to you.

1690
01:22:08,490 --> 01:22:09,957
- God.
- Don't be impressed by all this.

1691
01:22:10,058 --> 01:22:11,286
I read your blog.

1692
01:22:11,393 --> 01:22:13,418
You know, no, that was for web cretins.

1693
01:22:13,495 --> 01:22:15,156
You know why I started Napster?

1694
01:22:16,331 --> 01:22:21,132
The girl I loved in high school was with
the co-captain of the varsity lacrosse team,

1695
01:22:21,236 --> 01:22:23,261
and I wanted to take her from him.

1696
01:22:23,338 --> 01:22:25,272
So I decided to come up with
the next big thing.

1697
01:22:25,674 --> 01:22:28,234
- I didn t know that.
- Napster wasn't a failure.

1698
01:22:28,343 --> 01:22:31,779
I changed the music industry
for better and for always.

1699
01:22:31,847 --> 01:22:36,113
It may not have been good business,
but it pissed a lot of people off.

1700
01:22:36,185 --> 01:22:38,653
And isn't that what your Facemash
was about?

1701
01:22:38,754 --> 01:22:41,416
They're scared of me, pal,
and they're gonna be scared of you.

1702
01:22:41,523 --> 01:22:43,286
What the VCs want is to say,

1703
01:22:43,358 --> 01:22:46,191
"Good idea, kid,
the grown-ups will take it from here."

1704
01:22:46,295 --> 01:22:48,923
But not this time. This is our time.

1705
01:22:49,364 --> 01:22:52,822
This time, you're gonna hand them
a business card that says,

1706
01:22:52,935 --> 01:22:54,630
"I'm CEO, bitch."

1707
01:22:55,871 --> 01:22:57,702
That's what I want for you.

1708
01:22:58,440 --> 01:23:00,032
So where the hell is Eduardo?

1709
01:23:01,210 --> 01:23:03,678
- He's in New York.
- Sucking up to ad execs.

1710
01:23:03,779 --> 01:23:05,713
- He's got an...
- An internship.

1711
01:23:06,882 --> 01:23:10,374
The company's here.
A billion-dollar company's here.

1712
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:13,344
- Do you live and breathe Facebook?
- Yes.

1713
01:23:13,455 --> 01:23:14,547
I know you do.

1714
01:23:14,656 --> 01:23:17,716
Wardo wants to be a businessman
and for all I know he's gonna be a good one,

1715
01:23:17,826 --> 01:23:20,556
but he shouldn't be in New York
kissing Madison Avenue's ass.

1716
01:23:22,564 --> 01:23:25,727
This is a once-in-a-generation,
"holy shit" idea.

1717
01:23:26,068 --> 01:23:29,731
And the water under
the Golden Gate is freezing cold.

1718
01:23:31,473 --> 01:23:35,569
Look at my face and tell me
I don't know what I'm talking about.

1719
01:23:37,312 --> 01:23:38,836
Do you ever think about that girl?

1720
01:23:38,914 --> 01:23:39,972
What girl?

1721
01:23:40,082 --> 01:23:43,415
The girl from high school
with the lacrosse thing.

1722
01:23:44,753 --> 01:23:45,742
No.

1723
01:23:45,854 --> 01:23:49,381
If you guys are gonna talk about bandwidth,
we need shots.

1724
01:23:49,491 --> 01:23:50,981
A hundred schools
by the end of the summer?

1725
01:23:51,093 --> 01:23:52,082
Yeah.

1726
01:23:52,194 --> 01:23:53,559
Tell you what. Gesture of good faith.

1727
01:23:53,662 --> 01:23:58,099
While you're getting into 100 schools,
I'll put you on two continents.

1728
01:23:59,268 --> 01:24:00,360
Two...

1729
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:06,273
If you don't have a place to crash,

1730
01:24:06,375 --> 01:24:08,673
I think you should definitely
come and live with us.

1731
01:24:09,611 --> 01:24:11,545
Let's line up some shots.

1732
01:24:11,613 --> 01:24:13,740
- Excuse me!
- Yes, sir.

1733
01:24:13,849 --> 01:24:16,943
You can take this away
and bring back the 1942.

1734
01:24:17,052 --> 01:24:18,952
Absolutely, Mr. Parker.

1735
01:24:35,137 --> 01:24:38,129
Attention... Go!

1736
01:24:54,990 --> 01:24:59,484
<i>At the barrier, Hollandia is</i>
<i>leading Harvard University by one length</i>.

1737
01:25:09,338 --> 01:25:10,498
<i>Approaching the grandstands,</i>

1738
01:25:10,606 --> 01:25:13,734
<i>Hollandia maintains a lead</i>
<i>of three-quarters of a length</i>.

1739
01:25:26,955 --> 01:25:28,183
Come on!

1740
01:26:06,862 --> 01:26:08,193
Whatever.

1741
01:26:13,869 --> 01:26:14,893
- Mr. Winklevoss.
- Tyler.

1742
01:26:15,037 --> 01:26:16,868
- Tremendous race.
- Thank you.

1743
01:26:16,972 --> 01:26:19,202
- And this is my brother, Cameron.
- Excellent.

1744
01:26:19,307 --> 01:26:20,331
Sir?

1745
01:26:20,409 --> 01:26:22,138
His Royal Highness Prince Albert.

1746
01:26:22,244 --> 01:26:24,007
Your Highness, this is
Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.

1747
01:26:24,079 --> 01:26:27,412
Of course. Brilliant race.
I've never seen a race that close.

1748
01:26:27,549 --> 01:26:28,538
Yes, Your Highness.

1749
01:26:28,650 --> 01:26:31,676
My grandfather, Jack Kelly,
was one of the premier rowers of his day.

1750
01:26:31,753 --> 01:26:35,211
I've been coming to Henley for 30 years
and I'd never seen a race that close.

1751
01:26:35,590 --> 01:26:37,217
Have you? Have you seen a race that close?

1752
01:26:37,325 --> 01:26:38,383
No, Your Highness.

1753
01:26:38,493 --> 01:26:40,859
Mile-and-a-half races are more
commonly won by a boat length or two.

1754
01:26:40,929 --> 01:26:43,727
Yes, that's absolutely right. Brutally close.

1755
01:26:43,932 --> 01:26:44,990
May I introduce my teammates?

1756
01:26:45,100 --> 01:26:47,034
I'm sorry. You'll have to excuse us.

1757
01:26:47,102 --> 01:26:48,763
On to the Dutch.

1758
01:26:52,274 --> 01:26:53,673
Sorry you flew all the way out here
to see that.

1759
01:26:53,775 --> 01:26:55,902
Wouldn't have missed it, brother.
How was the royalty?

1760
01:26:56,011 --> 01:26:58,605
I just wanted him to tell me
a couple more times how close the race was.

1761
01:26:58,747 --> 01:27:02,239
Just brutal, brutally close.
Brutally excruciating. Jesus.

1762
01:27:02,350 --> 01:27:04,011
The guy is the prince of a country
the size of Nantucket.

1763
01:27:04,119 --> 01:27:05,108
Relax, it's fine.

1764
01:27:05,253 --> 01:27:06,413
- Boys. Divya.
- Dad.

1765
01:27:06,521 --> 01:27:08,546
- Mr. Winklevoss.
- That was a tough beat.

1766
01:27:08,623 --> 01:27:10,716
I'm sorry that you and Mom
had to fly out here to see that.

1767
01:27:10,792 --> 01:27:12,623
No, don't ever apologize to me
for losing a race like that.

1768
01:27:13,028 --> 01:27:15,622
Don't ever apologize to anyone
for losing a race like that.

1769
01:27:15,764 --> 01:27:17,595
- Boys.
- Mr. Kenwright.

1770
01:27:18,266 --> 01:27:20,928
Dad, this is Mr. Kenwright,
head of the host family for this week.

1771
01:27:21,036 --> 01:27:22,765
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

1772
01:27:22,871 --> 01:27:24,270
I've just had a phone chat with my daughter.

1773
01:27:24,372 --> 01:27:27,307
She told me that she and her friends
are already talking about the race.

1774
01:27:27,442 --> 01:27:29,706
which they've just seen via their computers.

1775
01:27:29,811 --> 01:27:33,645
A new website called Facebook.
Do you have this in America?

1776
01:27:34,983 --> 01:27:37,144
I'm gonna find your mother.

1777
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:39,744
Have I said something wrong?

1778
01:27:39,821 --> 01:27:41,721
Your daughter doesn't go
to school in the States?

1779
01:27:41,823 --> 01:27:43,120
No, no. Cambridge.

1780
01:27:43,225 --> 01:27:45,955
Majoring in French literature, though
I wasn't aware there was such a thing.

1781
01:27:46,061 --> 01:27:47,119
And they have Facebook at Cambridge?

1782
01:27:47,229 --> 01:27:49,288
And apparently Oxford and
the London School of Economics.

1783
01:27:49,397 --> 01:27:50,455
That's where her friends are.

1784
01:27:51,066 --> 01:27:52,556
That's awesome.

1785
01:27:53,001 --> 01:27:56,493
Good race, boys.
Take the bitter with the better, eh?

1786
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:00,239
I'm gonna go watch the race film.

1787
01:28:03,578 --> 01:28:05,842
If this is online, I wanna see it.

1788
01:28:05,981 --> 01:28:07,312
Stop it.

1789
01:28:07,849 --> 01:28:09,339
Stop it, Cam.

1790
01:28:09,751 --> 01:28:11,241
Knock it off.

1791
01:28:11,820 --> 01:28:14,345
I don't mind that we lost
to the Dutch today by less than a second.

1792
01:28:14,489 --> 01:28:16,650
That was a good race,
and that was a fair race.

1793
01:28:16,758 --> 01:28:18,191
And they'll see us again.

1794
01:28:18,326 --> 01:28:20,453
What I mind, and what you should mind,

1795
01:28:20,529 --> 01:28:23,692
is showing up on Monday
for a race that was run on Sunday.

1796
01:28:24,266 --> 01:28:26,166
We tried talking to him ourselves,
we tried writing a letter,

1797
01:28:26,268 --> 01:28:29,829
we tried the Ad Board, and we tried
talking to the president of the university.

1798
01:28:29,938 --> 01:28:32,429
Now, I am asking you for the last time,

1799
01:28:32,541 --> 01:28:37,706
let's take the considerable resources
at our disposal and sue him in federal court.

1800
01:28:38,180 --> 01:28:39,442
Come on.

1801
01:28:40,849 --> 01:28:42,680
I need a real drink.

1802
01:28:49,558 --> 01:28:50,547
Screw it.

1803
01:28:52,027 --> 01:28:54,222
Let's gut the friggin' nerd.

1804
01:28:57,065 --> 01:28:58,396
That's what I'm talking about!

1805
01:28:58,567 --> 01:29:00,398
No, no, no, no, no.

1806
01:29:00,569 --> 01:29:02,833
But check it out, I saw him today.

1807
01:29:02,904 --> 01:29:05,338
Manningham, Mitchell Manningham,
my Case Equity guy.

1808
01:29:05,407 --> 01:29:06,499
Hang on.

1809
01:29:06,575 --> 01:29:08,236
Are you guys using Spikes
or Ghost Missiles?

1810
01:29:08,343 --> 01:29:10,004
We don't know,
we're just shooting at each other.

1811
01:29:10,078 --> 01:29:11,511
Use Sweet Kamikazes.

1812
01:29:11,580 --> 01:29:13,707
Like we know what that is.

1813
01:29:14,216 --> 01:29:18,016
I saw him getting into his Turbo Carrera
and he saw me, too.

1814
01:29:18,086 --> 01:29:19,678
I know he did.

1815
01:29:22,090 --> 01:29:25,059
Don't. Don't sweat it. I'm on a landline.

1816
01:29:25,227 --> 01:29:26,558
Bong hit.

1817
01:29:27,262 --> 01:29:28,752
Does anybody hear that banging?

1818
01:29:28,864 --> 01:29:31,264
You don't hear anything.
You're writing code.

1819
01:29:31,366 --> 01:29:33,357
Dude, somebody's at the door.

1820
01:29:33,435 --> 01:29:38,031
It's not a dish best served cold.
It's best served immediately and relentlessly.

1821
01:29:41,743 --> 01:29:43,574
I'm gonna call you back.

1822
01:29:45,580 --> 01:29:48,071
What's up?

1823
01:29:49,784 --> 01:29:51,547
Mark was supposed to pick me up
at the airport an hour ago.

1824
01:29:51,620 --> 01:29:53,212
I've been calling his cell.

1825
01:29:53,288 --> 01:29:57,782
He was on a 36-hour coding tear,
so he took a nap for a couple of hours.

1826
01:30:04,065 --> 01:30:05,123
What happened here?

1827
01:30:05,267 --> 01:30:08,725
Not happened. Happening.
The next big thing.

1828
01:30:08,803 --> 01:30:09,963
Wardo.

1829
01:30:10,071 --> 01:30:11,060
Hey, man.

1830
01:30:11,139 --> 01:30:13,130
- Back to work.
- Okay.

1831
01:30:13,241 --> 01:30:16,142
The more bad I get at this,
the more wasted I get.

1832
01:30:16,278 --> 01:30:17,768
I mean the more wasted that I get...

1833
01:30:18,146 --> 01:30:19,579
We understand.

1834
01:30:21,950 --> 01:30:23,076
How old are they, Sean?

1835
01:30:23,652 --> 01:30:24,983
It's not polite to ask.

1836
01:30:25,086 --> 01:30:26,246
Sean, how old are they?

1837
01:30:27,489 --> 01:30:28,820
You think you know me, right?

1838
01:30:28,957 --> 01:30:30,151
I've read enough.

1839
01:30:30,292 --> 01:30:32,624
You know how much I've read about you?

1840
01:30:33,161 --> 01:30:34,492
Nothing.

1841
01:30:38,333 --> 01:30:40,096
- Wardo.
- Hey, man.

1842
01:30:40,168 --> 01:30:43,103
- I waited an hour for you at the airport.
- What time is it?

1843
01:30:43,171 --> 01:30:46,504
It's midnight. Or 3:00 a.m. in New York,
where I just came from.

1844
01:30:46,608 --> 01:30:50,271
You gotta see some of the new stuff we got.
Hey, Dustin. Show him the Wall.

1845
01:30:50,345 --> 01:30:51,437
I'm just calling it the Wall.

1846
01:30:51,513 --> 01:30:54,107
Forget the Wall, tell him about
the meeting I've got set up.

1847
01:30:54,182 --> 01:30:55,774
You know Peter Thiel?

1848
01:30:55,850 --> 01:30:57,181
- Nope.
- No reason you should.

1849
01:30:57,285 --> 01:31:00,516
He just runs a $2-billion hedge fund
called Clarium Capital.

1850
01:31:02,023 --> 01:31:03,615
Why's he setting up meetings?

1851
01:31:03,692 --> 01:31:04,784
Thiel might wanna make
an angel investment.

1852
01:31:04,859 --> 01:31:07,953
I don't care if he's an actual angel.
Why is he settng up business meetings?

1853
01:31:08,029 --> 01:31:10,691
- You ve had a long flight.
- No, I had a long wait on the tarmac at JFK,

1854
01:31:10,799 --> 01:31:13,029
then a long wait at the passenger
loading and unloading zone at SFO,

1855
01:31:13,168 --> 01:31:15,033
and in between there was a long flight.

1856
01:31:15,170 --> 01:31:16,865
I'm the business end of this company.

1857
01:31:17,639 --> 01:31:20,039
And he is a houseguest living here rent free

1858
01:31:20,175 --> 01:31:23,042
on a very generous grant
from the Eduardo Saverin Foundation.

1859
01:31:23,178 --> 01:31:26,477
I heard about your big-ticket ad buys.
Gary's Tuxedos.

1860
01:31:26,548 --> 01:31:28,209
- Hey, man...
- Harvard Bartending Course.

1861
01:31:28,316 --> 01:31:31,513
You're just a small step away
from bagging Snookies Cookies, I can feel it.

1862
01:31:40,695 --> 01:31:42,993
- You wanna talk to me alone for a minute?
- Sure.

1863
01:31:47,335 --> 01:31:48,666
Bong hit.

1864
01:31:48,737 --> 01:31:51,035
- I'm so high.
- No, you're not.

1865
01:31:51,573 --> 01:31:53,336
So how's it going?

1866
01:31:53,675 --> 01:31:56,337
How's the internship? How's Christy?

1867
01:31:57,345 --> 01:31:59,677
- How's the internship?
- Yeah.

1868
01:32:01,216 --> 01:32:03,184
Mark, Jesus, I quit the internship.

1869
01:32:03,251 --> 01:32:05,742
We talked about this on the phone.
I quit on my first day.

1870
01:32:07,389 --> 01:32:09,755
I do remember you saying that.

1871
01:32:09,924 --> 01:32:11,721
So how is Christy?

1872
01:32:12,093 --> 01:32:13,754
Christy's crazy.

1873
01:32:14,062 --> 01:32:15,757
- Is that fun?
- No.

1874
01:32:15,864 --> 01:32:16,853
I mean, she's actually psychotic.

1875
01:32:16,931 --> 01:32:22,096
Shes insanely jealous she's irrational,
and I'm frightened of her.

1876
01:32:22,771 --> 01:32:24,068
Still, it's nice you have a girlfriend.

1877
01:32:27,609 --> 01:32:31,705
I do not want that guy representing
himself as part of this company.

1878
01:32:31,780 --> 01:32:33,941
You gotta move out here, Wardo,
this is where it's all happening.

1879
01:32:34,049 --> 01:32:36,040
- Did you hear what I just said?
- The connections, the energy...

1880
01:32:36,117 --> 01:32:37,106
Mark, you got...

1881
01:32:37,252 --> 01:32:39,777
I'm afraid if you don't come out here,
you're gonna get left behind.

1882
01:32:39,888 --> 01:32:42,220
I want... I need you out here.

1883
01:32:42,290 --> 01:32:44,224
- Please don't tell him I said that.
- What did you just say?

1884
01:32:44,292 --> 01:32:46,385
It's moving faster than any of us
ever imagined it would.

1885
01:32:46,461 --> 01:32:48,224
- It's moving fast.
- What did you mean?

1886
01:32:48,296 --> 01:32:50,230
- And Sean thinks we have...
- Sean is not part of this company.

1887
01:32:50,298 --> 01:32:51,390
We have over 300,000 members, Wardo,

1888
01:32:51,466 --> 01:32:53,627
and we're in 160 schools,
including five in Europe.

1889
01:32:53,735 --> 01:32:55,225
I'm aware of that! Mark, I am the CFO!

1890
01:32:55,303 --> 01:32:56,736
We need more servers
than I ever expected we'd need.

1891
01:32:56,805 --> 01:32:58,397
We need more programmers
and we need more money,

1892
01:32:58,473 --> 01:33:00,964
and he set up the Thiel meeting.
He set up meetings all over town.

1893
01:33:01,109 --> 01:33:02,303
- He set up other meetings?
- Yes.

1894
01:33:02,410 --> 01:33:04,139
- Wthout me knowing anything about it.
- You're in New York.

1895
01:33:04,279 --> 01:33:08,147
I'm n New York riding subways
14 hours a day, trying to find advertisers!

1896
01:33:08,283 --> 01:33:09,944
And how's it going so far?

1897
01:33:14,422 --> 01:33:16,913
What did you mean, "get left behind"?

1898
01:33:21,629 --> 01:33:22,994
- Hi.
- Can I help you?

1899
01:33:23,098 --> 01:33:24,588
I'd like to freeze this bank account

1900
01:33:24,666 --> 01:33:28,124
and cancel all existing checks
and lines of credit.

1901
01:33:29,471 --> 01:33:32,634
- May I see some ID, please?
- Yeah, sure, sorry.

1902
01:33:39,447 --> 01:33:40,675
Sean, he'll be right with you.

1903
01:33:40,782 --> 01:33:42,181
No problem.

1904
01:33:44,018 --> 01:33:46,282
You know this is where
they filmed <i>Towering Inferno?</i>

1905
01:33:46,354 --> 01:33:48,117
That's comforting.

1906
01:33:49,524 --> 01:33:51,287
Hey, guys. Come on back.

1907
01:33:52,794 --> 01:33:55,024
- She offer you some waters?
- Oh, yeah. We're cool.

1908
01:33:56,631 --> 01:33:57,859
Sean, how are you? Come on in.

1909
01:33:57,966 --> 01:33:59,866
- You must be Mark.
- Hi.

1910
01:34:01,669 --> 01:34:05,002
We took a look at everything,
and congratulations.

1911
01:34:05,140 --> 01:34:08,632
We're gonna start you off
with a $500,000 investment.

1912
01:34:09,043 --> 01:34:12,706
Maurice is gonna talk to you
about some corporate restructuring.

1913
01:34:12,847 --> 01:34:14,872
We'll file as a corporation in Delaware

1914
01:34:14,983 --> 01:34:17,884
and come up with a stock structure
that allows for new investors.

1915
01:34:17,986 --> 01:34:20,318
Now, let me ask you something.

1916
01:34:20,488 --> 01:34:22,388
Who's Eduardo Saverin?

1917
01:34:42,744 --> 01:34:44,006
Jesus Christ.

1918
01:34:47,582 --> 01:34:48,674
When did you get back?

1919
01:34:48,750 --> 01:34:50,183
You scared me. I need you to knock.

1920
01:34:50,251 --> 01:34:52,185
When did you get back?

1921
01:34:53,254 --> 01:34:54,915
I got back this afternoon.

1922
01:34:55,056 --> 01:34:56,523
And when were you gonna call me?

1923
01:34:56,591 --> 01:34:59,253
Chris, it was kind of a rough trip
and I was tired...

1924
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:03,262
Yeah, or answerone of my 47 texts.
Did you know I sent 47 texts?

1925
01:35:03,364 --> 01:35:07,232
I did, and I thought that was
incredibly normal behavior.

1926
01:35:07,368 --> 01:35:08,858
Are you mocking me?

1927
01:35:09,070 --> 01:35:10,264
I brought you a present.

1928
01:35:12,106 --> 01:35:14,939
Why does your Status say "single"
on your Facebook page?

1929
01:35:15,076 --> 01:35:16,100
What?

1930
01:35:16,211 --> 01:35:20,113
Why does your Relationship Status
say "single" on your Facebook page?

1931
01:35:20,215 --> 01:35:21,876
Well, I was single when I set up the page.

1932
01:35:21,950 --> 01:35:24,043
And you just never bothered to change it?

1933
01:35:24,118 --> 01:35:25,210
What?

1934
01:35:25,420 --> 01:35:26,887
I don't know how.

1935
01:35:26,955 --> 01:35:28,786
Do I look stupid to you?

1936
01:35:28,923 --> 01:35:30,220
No, calm down.

1937
01:35:30,291 --> 01:35:32,555
You're asking me to believe
that the CFO of Facebook

1938
01:35:32,627 --> 01:35:34,891
doesn't know how to change
his Relationship Status on Facebook?

1939
01:35:34,963 --> 01:35:38,296
It's embarrassing, so you should take it
as a sign of trust that I would tell you that.

1940
01:35:38,433 --> 01:35:39,627
- Go to hell.
- Take it easy.

1941
01:35:39,767 --> 01:35:42,793
No, you didn't change it so you could
screw those Silicon Valley sluts

1942
01:35:42,904 --> 01:35:44,064
every time you go out to see Mark.

1943
01:35:44,138 --> 01:35:47,130
Not even remotely true and I can
promise you that the Silicon Valley sluts

1944
01:35:47,275 --> 01:35:50,142
don't care what anyone's
Relationship Status is on Facebook.

1945
01:35:50,278 --> 01:35:51,643
Please, open your present.

1946
01:35:51,779 --> 01:35:53,644
Your phone does work.

1947
01:35:54,616 --> 01:35:55,742
It's Mark.

1948
01:35:55,817 --> 01:35:57,978
Okay, this is gonna be tricky.

1949
01:35:58,086 --> 01:36:00,577
Open your present. It's a silk scarf.

1950
01:36:00,655 --> 01:36:02,316
Have you ever seen me wear a scarf?

1951
01:36:02,757 --> 01:36:04,588
This'll be your first.

1952
01:36:04,659 --> 01:36:05,751
Yeah.

1953
01:36:05,827 --> 01:36:07,089
<i>- You froze our account?</i>
- I did.

1954
01:36:07,161 --> 01:36:09,425
- You froze the account.
- I had to get your attention, Mark.

1955
01:36:09,497 --> 01:36:11,260
Do you realize that you jeopardized
the entire company?

1956
01:36:11,332 --> 01:36:12,924
Do you realize that your actions
could have destroyed

1957
01:36:13,001 --> 01:36:13,990
everything I've been working on?

1958
01:36:14,135 --> 01:36:15,159
We have been working on.

1959
01:36:15,270 --> 01:36:16,760
Without money, the site can't function.

1960
01:36:16,838 --> 01:36:19,102
Let me tell you the dfference
between Facebook and everybody else.

1961
01:36:19,173 --> 01:36:20,265
We don't crash ever!

1962
01:36:20,341 --> 01:36:24,004
If the servers are down for even a day, our
entire reputation is irreversibly destroyed.

1963
01:36:24,112 --> 01:36:26,103
- Look...
<i>- Users are fickle. Friendster has proved that</i>.

1964
01:36:26,180 --> 01:36:28,944
<i>Even a few people leaving would reverberate</i>
<i>through the entire user base</i>.

1965
01:36:29,017 --> 01:36:31,349
The users are interconnected.
That is the whole point.

1966
01:36:31,452 --> 01:36:33,181
College kids are online
because their friends are online

1967
01:36:33,288 --> 01:36:35,449
and if one domino goes,
the other dominos go.

1968
01:36:35,523 --> 01:36:36,615
Don't you get that?

1969
01:36:36,691 --> 01:36:38,318
I am not going back to
the Caribbean Night at A-E-Pi!

1970
01:36:40,328 --> 01:36:41,693
Holy shit.

1971
01:36:44,532 --> 01:36:45,863
What is wrong with you?

1972
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,467
Did you like being nobody?

1973
01:36:47,535 --> 01:36:49,298
Did you like being a joke?
Do you wanna go back to that?

1974
01:36:49,370 --> 01:36:50,803
Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on.

1975
01:36:50,872 --> 01:36:52,203
<i>That was the act of a child,</i>
<i>not a businessman,</i>

1976
01:36:52,307 --> 01:36:53,706
<i>and it certainly was not the act of a friend.</i>

1977
01:36:53,841 --> 01:36:56,366
You know how embarrassing it was for me
to try to cash a check today?

1978
01:36:56,477 --> 01:36:57,705
I am not going back to that life.

1979
01:36:57,845 --> 01:37:00,211
<i>- Maybe you were frustrated.</i>
- Yeah!

1980
01:37:00,381 --> 01:37:02,679
- Maybe you were angry.
- I was!

1981
01:37:02,884 --> 01:37:05,216
But I am willing to let bygones be bygones,

1982
01:37:05,353 --> 01:37:07,651
<i>because, Wardo,I've got some good news.</i>

1983
01:37:07,722 --> 01:37:08,882
I'm sorry.

1984
01:37:08,990 --> 01:37:13,723
I was angry, and maybe it was childish,
but I had to get your attention.

1985
01:37:13,861 --> 01:37:16,659
Wardo, I said I've got some good news.

1986
01:37:17,065 --> 01:37:18,054
What is it?

1987
01:37:18,199 --> 01:37:20,724
Peter Thiel just made an angel investment
of half a million dollars.

1988
01:37:20,835 --> 01:37:21,995
What?

1989
01:37:22,203 --> 01:37:26,162
<i>Half a million dollars.</i>
<i>And he's setting us up in an office</i>.

1990
01:37:26,908 --> 01:37:29,399
They wanna reincorporate the company.
They wanna meet you.

1991
01:37:29,544 --> 01:37:31,011
They need your signature
on some documents,

1992
01:37:31,079 --> 01:37:33,513
so you gotta get your ass
on the first flight back to San Francisco.

1993
01:37:33,581 --> 01:37:35,173
<i>I need my CFO.</i>

1994
01:37:40,088 --> 01:37:41,180
I'm on my way.

1995
01:37:41,255 --> 01:37:42,745
<i>- Wardo?</i>
- Yeah?

1996
01:37:42,924 --> 01:37:44,391
We did it.

1997
01:37:47,729 --> 01:37:48,923
Wardo?

1998
01:37:49,530 --> 01:37:51,430
You're going back there already?

1999
01:37:51,566 --> 01:37:52,692
Yes.

2000
01:37:54,435 --> 01:37:56,596
And also, I'm breaking up with you.

2001
01:38:00,441 --> 01:38:02,238
Somebody stop her!

2002
01:38:04,746 --> 01:38:05,770
Four documents.

2003
01:38:05,913 --> 01:38:07,778
The frst two are common stock
purchase agreements,

2004
01:38:07,915 --> 01:38:10,941
allowing you to buy stock
in the newly reincorporated Facebook,

2005
01:38:11,052 --> 01:38:14,453
as opposed to the old shares,
which are now worthless.

2006
01:38:14,555 --> 01:38:15,715
The third is an exchange agreement

2007
01:38:15,790 --> 01:38:18,554
allowing you to exchange
the old shares for new shares,

2008
01:38:18,626 --> 01:38:20,890
and then finally a voter holding agreement.

2009
01:38:20,962 --> 01:38:22,725
How many shares of stock will I own?

2010
01:38:22,797 --> 01:38:25,960
1,328,334.

2011
01:38:26,067 --> 01:38:27,432
Jesus Christ.

2012
01:38:27,535 --> 01:38:30,436
That represents a 34.4% ownership share.

2013
01:38:30,938 --> 01:38:33,270
Why the increase from the original 30%?

2014
01:38:33,374 --> 01:38:36,104
Cause you may need to dilute it
to award shares to new investors.

2015
01:38:36,811 --> 01:38:39,075
- I love working with business majors.
- I'm telling you.

2016
01:38:39,147 --> 01:38:40,205
- Economics.
- Right.

2017
01:38:40,281 --> 01:38:45,218
You should know that Mark has already
taken his percentage from 60 down to 51.

2018
01:38:46,487 --> 01:38:49,752
Well, Mark doesn't care about money
and he needs to be protected.

2019
01:38:51,793 --> 01:38:54,125
Dustin Moskovitz owns 6.81%...

2020
01:38:54,228 --> 01:38:57,061
Sean Parker, 6.47%...

2021
01:38:59,300 --> 01:39:00,324
I can live with that.

2022
01:39:00,435 --> 01:39:02,266
And Peter Thiel, 7%.

2023
01:39:06,641 --> 01:39:08,939
Would you like to use my pen?

2024
01:39:09,177 --> 01:39:12,146
Eduardo? Eduardo?

2025
01:39:13,915 --> 01:39:15,007
Can you please repeat the question?

2026
01:39:15,116 --> 01:39:17,311
No, it was an outrageously leading question
the first time around,

2027
01:39:17,418 --> 01:39:18,510
and now you want us to hear it twice?

2028
01:39:18,619 --> 01:39:20,484
Yes. Would you read it back, please?

2029
01:39:20,588 --> 01:39:21,612
Well, go ahead.

2030
01:39:21,689 --> 01:39:23,418
"Counsel: 'And when you signed
these documents,

2031
01:39:23,491 --> 01:39:26,255
"'were you aware that you were signing
your own death certficate?"'

2032
01:39:26,327 --> 01:39:27,419
No.

2033
01:39:31,833 --> 01:39:35,963
It was insanely stupid of me not to have
my own lawyers look over all the...

2034
01:39:36,037 --> 01:39:39,200
In all honesty,
I thought they were my lawyers.

2035
01:39:42,477 --> 01:39:44,035
I was your only friend.

2036
01:39:45,980 --> 01:39:47,311
You had one friend.

2037
01:39:52,153 --> 01:39:53,177
My father won't even look at me.

2038
01:39:53,287 --> 01:39:58,350
Okay, Eduardo, did Mr. Zuckerberg say
anything to you after you signed the papers?

2039
01:39:58,493 --> 01:40:01,485
There was a lot of handshaking,
a lot of congratulations.

2040
01:40:02,663 --> 01:40:04,028
He'd already told me that he wouldn't be

2041
01:40:04,131 --> 01:40:07,225
coming back to school
for at least a semester,

2042
01:40:07,335 --> 01:40:10,065
so we were saying goodbye for a while.

2043
01:40:10,872 --> 01:40:12,134
And then before I left he said...

2044
01:40:12,206 --> 01:40:13,298
But you gotta come back.

2045
01:40:13,374 --> 01:40:15,865
Somewhere around the end of November
or early December.

2046
01:40:15,977 --> 01:40:18,411
Peter wants to throw us an amazing party
when we hit a million members.

2047
01:40:18,513 --> 01:40:20,242
It's gonna be out of control.
You gotta come back for it.

2048
01:40:20,348 --> 01:40:21,645
A million members?

2049
01:40:21,716 --> 01:40:22,876
Yeah.

2050
01:40:23,384 --> 01:40:26,683
Remember the algorithm
on the window at Kirkland?

2051
01:40:27,588 --> 01:40:28,816
Yeah.

2052
01:40:32,226 --> 01:40:33,488
Yeah, I'll be here.

2053
01:40:38,666 --> 01:40:39,826
You sure about this?

2054
01:40:39,901 --> 01:40:41,061
You're 20 minutes late.

2055
01:40:41,168 --> 01:40:42,601
You're gonna walk in there
and say you overslept

2056
01:40:42,703 --> 01:40:43,829
and didn't have time to get dressed.

2057
01:40:43,905 --> 01:40:46,066
They're gonna pitch you.
Case Equity is going to pitch you.

2058
01:40:46,173 --> 01:40:47,731
They're gonna beg you to take their money.

2059
01:40:47,842 --> 01:40:49,503
You're gonna nod, you re gonna nod,
you're gonna nod,

2060
01:40:49,577 --> 01:40:52,603
and then you're gonna say,
"Which one of you is Roth?"

2061
01:40:52,713 --> 01:40:54,112
No, not Roth. Manningham.

2062
01:40:54,215 --> 01:40:56,342
"Which one of you is Mitchell Manningham?"
And he'll say, "I am."

2063
01:40:56,417 --> 01:40:59,875
And then you say,
"Sean Parker says, 'Fuck you.'"

2064
01:41:00,421 --> 01:41:01,752
Walk out.

2065
01:41:01,889 --> 01:41:03,049
Okay.

2066
01:41:15,903 --> 01:41:18,030
In late November, I got the e-mail from Mark

2067
01:41:18,105 --> 01:41:20,130
telling me to come out
for the millionth-member party.

2068
01:41:20,241 --> 01:41:21,265
What else did the e-mail say?

2069
01:41:21,876 --> 01:41:24,037
It said that we had to have
a business meeting.

2070
01:41:24,912 --> 01:41:28,143
That Mark and Sean had played
some kind of revenge stunt on Case Equity,

2071
01:41:28,816 --> 01:41:30,443
<i>and that Manningham was so impressed</i>

2072
01:41:30,551 --> 01:41:34,453
<i>that he was now making an investment offer</i>
<i>that was hard to turn down.</i>

2073
01:41:34,555 --> 01:41:38,719
<i>So I went to California,</i>
<i>and I went straight to the new offices.</i>

2074
01:41:38,793 --> 01:41:42,490
<i>I didn't know whether to dress for the party</i>
<i>or for the business meeting</i>,

2075
01:41:42,597 --> 01:41:44,963
<i>so I kind of dressed for both.</i>

2076
01:41:45,666 --> 01:41:47,634
<i>- But it didn't matter.</i>
<i>- Why not?</i>

2077
01:41:47,735 --> 01:41:49,930
<i>Because I wasn't called out there</i>
<i>for either one.</i>

2078
01:41:50,004 --> 01:41:51,596
What were you called out there for?

2079
01:41:55,443 --> 01:41:56,808
An ambush.

2080
01:41:57,244 --> 01:41:59,075
Mr Saverin. Hey. Right over here.

2081
01:42:06,187 --> 01:42:07,245
Hey, man.

2082
01:42:07,321 --> 01:42:08,345
- How are you?
- Good. How are you?

2083
01:42:08,456 --> 01:42:11,152
- Good, good, good, good, good.
- Good to see you.

2084
01:42:11,258 --> 01:42:14,694
At first I thought he was joking.
Giving me more contracts to sign.

2085
01:42:19,100 --> 01:42:20,863
But then I started reading.

2086
01:42:24,271 --> 01:42:26,034
Wait, what is this?

2087
01:42:26,374 --> 01:42:29,639
Well, as you know, we had some
new investors that have come in.

2088
01:42:29,777 --> 01:42:30,801
What is this?

2089
01:42:43,124 --> 01:42:44,557
Mr. Saverin.

2090
01:42:47,194 --> 01:42:48,354
Mark!

2091
01:42:49,664 --> 01:42:51,131
- Mark?
- He's wired in.

2092
01:42:51,198 --> 01:42:52,222
- Sorry?
- He's wired in.

2093
01:42:52,333 --> 01:42:53,800
- Is he?
- Yes.

2094
01:42:55,369 --> 01:42:58,133
- How about now? Are you still wired in?
- Call security.

2095
01:42:58,205 --> 01:43:00,036
You issued 24 million new shares of stock!

2096
01:43:01,242 --> 01:43:02,869
You were told that if new investors
came along...

2097
01:43:02,977 --> 01:43:06,071
How much were your shares diluted?
How much were his?

2098
01:43:06,180 --> 01:43:09,911
What was Mr. Zuckerberg's
ownership share diluted down to?

2099
01:43:10,251 --> 01:43:11,309
It wasn't.

2100
01:43:11,385 --> 01:43:15,014
What was Mr. Moskovitz's ownership share
diluted down to?

2101
01:43:15,089 --> 01:43:16,420
It wasn't.

2102
01:43:16,524 --> 01:43:19,425
What was Sean Parker's ownership share
diluted down to?

2103
01:43:19,527 --> 01:43:20,551
It wasn't.

2104
01:43:20,661 --> 01:43:23,323
What was Peter Thiel's ownership share
diluted down to?

2105
01:43:23,397 --> 01:43:24,489
It wasn't.

2106
01:43:24,565 --> 01:43:27,557
And what was your ownership share
diluted down to?

2107
01:43:28,569 --> 01:43:31,231
.03%

2108
01:43:39,080 --> 01:43:41,378
- You signed the papers.
- You set me up.

2109
01:43:41,449 --> 01:43:44,009
You're gonna blame me because you were
the business head of the company,

2110
01:43:44,085 --> 01:43:45,950
and you made a bad business deal
wth your own company?

2111
01:43:46,053 --> 01:43:47,680
It's gonna be like I'm not a part of Facebook.

2112
01:43:47,755 --> 01:43:49,086
It won't be like
you're not a part of Facebook.

2113
01:43:49,190 --> 01:43:50,214
You're not a part of Facebook.

2114
01:43:50,291 --> 01:43:52,691
- My name's on the masthead.
- You might wanna check again.

2115
01:43:52,760 --> 01:43:54,091
This because I froze the account?

2116
01:43:54,195 --> 01:43:56,356
You think we'd let you
parade around in your ridiculous suits,

2117
01:43:56,430 --> 01:43:57,454
pretending you were running this company?

2118
01:43:57,565 --> 01:43:59,897
Sorry, my Prada's at the cleaner's!

2119
01:43:59,967 --> 01:44:04,370
Along with my hoodie and my fuck-you
flip-flops, you pretentious douchebag!

2120
01:44:04,438 --> 01:44:06,099
Security's here. You'll be leaving now.

2121
01:44:06,207 --> 01:44:09,108
- I'm not signing those papers.
- We will get the signature.

2122
01:44:09,210 --> 01:44:11,303
Tell me this isn't about me
getting into the Phoenix.

2123
01:44:13,981 --> 01:44:18,213
You... You did it. I knew you did it.
You planted that story about the chicken!

2124
01:44:18,285 --> 01:44:20,412
- I didn't plant that story.
- What's he talking about?

2125
01:44:20,488 --> 01:44:23,457
- You had me acoused of animal cruelty.
- Seriously. What the hell's the chicken?

2126
01:44:23,557 --> 01:44:25,252
And I'll bet what you hated the most

2127
01:44:25,326 --> 01:44:28,762
is that they identified me
as a co-founder of Facebook.

2128
01:44:29,230 --> 01:44:32,063
Which I am. You better lawyer up, asshole.

2129
01:44:32,133 --> 01:44:36,661
'Cause I'm not coming back for 30%.
I'm coming back for everything.

2130
01:44:43,144 --> 01:44:46,113
- Get him out of here.
- It's okay, I'm going.

2131
01:44:48,082 --> 01:44:49,344
Hang on.

2132
01:44:51,585 --> 01:44:53,143
Almost forgot.

2133
01:44:54,188 --> 01:44:56,486
Here's your $19,000.
I wouldn't cash it, though.

2134
01:44:56,590 --> 01:44:58,114
I drew it on the account you froze.

2135
01:45:03,430 --> 01:45:05,955
I like standing next to you, Sean.

2136
01:45:07,201 --> 01:45:09,328
It makes me look so tough.

2137
01:45:22,483 --> 01:45:23,780
Well...

2138
01:45:24,218 --> 01:45:27,153
That's it, that's our show for tonight, people.

2139
01:45:27,221 --> 01:45:29,519
And look, I wanna see everyone here
geared up for a party.

2140
01:45:29,623 --> 01:45:31,682
We're gonna walk into that club
like it's the Macy's Parade.

2141
01:45:31,792 --> 01:45:34,886
Mackey, put it up on the big screen.
We've gotta almost be there.

2142
01:45:38,165 --> 01:45:40,030
- You all right?
- Yeah.

2143
01:45:41,302 --> 01:45:42,735
You were kind of rough on him.

2144
01:45:42,837 --> 01:45:44,828
That's life in the NFL.

2145
01:45:45,039 --> 01:45:46,666
You know you didn't have to be
that rough on him.

2146
01:45:46,740 --> 01:45:48,901
- Listen, I put him...
- Sean!

2147
01:45:50,211 --> 01:45:52,304
You didn't have to be that rough on him.

2148
01:45:52,379 --> 01:45:53,573
He almost killed it.

2149
01:45:56,350 --> 01:45:57,544
I'll send flowers.

2150
01:45:59,253 --> 01:46:03,986
Speaking of flowers, I'm putting together
a party after the party at Kappa Eta Sigma.

2151
01:46:04,058 --> 01:46:05,320
Ashleigh's a sister.

2152
01:46:05,392 --> 01:46:06,916
- Ashleigh?
- The intern.

2153
01:46:07,027 --> 01:46:10,190
Yeah. I know who she is. Are you guys...

2154
01:46:10,831 --> 01:46:12,492
Ashleigh? Me? No.

2155
01:46:12,566 --> 01:46:14,033
Well, a little bit.

2156
01:46:14,902 --> 01:46:15,926
Why?

2157
01:46:16,036 --> 01:46:17,867
- No. Nothing, I just...
- Excuse me. Mark?

2158
01:46:17,938 --> 01:46:21,203
- We were just talking about you.
- Just that you're doing a really good job.

2159
01:46:21,876 --> 01:46:24,037
Thanks. I appreciate that.

2160
01:46:25,045 --> 01:46:26,103
These came in for you.

2161
01:46:26,213 --> 01:46:28,010
Put them on my desk.

2162
01:46:34,955 --> 01:46:36,388
What's the package?

2163
01:46:37,258 --> 01:46:38,282
Nothing.

2164
01:46:40,728 --> 01:46:42,218
- Mackey.
- Yes, sir.

2165
01:46:42,296 --> 01:46:43,593
Refresh.

2166
01:46:44,098 --> 01:46:45,292
Sweet!

2167
01:46:51,305 --> 01:46:53,364
And you're not a hugger.

2168
01:46:53,641 --> 01:46:54,938
I know.

2169
01:46:57,578 --> 01:46:59,045
One million!

2170
01:47:00,614 --> 01:47:03,378
Who's got champagne? Huh?

2171
01:47:04,718 --> 01:47:06,481
I've got champagne.

2172
01:47:26,340 --> 01:47:29,935
The next transformative development,
a picture-sharing application.

2173
01:47:30,010 --> 01:47:33,104
A place where you view pictures
that coincide with your socal life.

2174
01:47:33,180 --> 01:47:36,172
It is the true digitalization of real life.

2175
01:47:36,283 --> 01:47:38,751
- You can use a CD.
- You can do it off of me.

2176
01:47:38,819 --> 01:47:40,514
You don't just go to a party anymore.

2177
01:47:40,621 --> 01:47:44,352
You go to a party with a digital camera,
and then your friends relive the party online.

2178
01:47:44,458 --> 01:47:45,823
And tagging. The idea...

2179
01:47:45,926 --> 01:47:49,123
- Would this be easier without the bra?
- It's worth finding out.

2180
01:47:56,870 --> 01:47:59,270
All right, shut the music down!

2181
01:47:59,640 --> 01:48:01,267
The party's over!

2182
01:48:01,342 --> 01:48:03,139
Everybody, go home!

2183
01:48:03,644 --> 01:48:06,112
I've spent hours watching
what people do when they log on.

2184
01:48:06,180 --> 01:48:07,545
How they check their friends' status updates.

2185
01:48:07,648 --> 01:48:09,138
Wait. That's weird. Why did the music stop?

2186
01:48:09,216 --> 01:48:10,376
Check to see which one of their friends

2187
01:48:10,484 --> 01:48:12,384
changed their profiles,
changed their photos...

2188
01:48:12,486 --> 01:48:14,044
Seriously, what happened to the music?

2189
01:48:14,154 --> 01:48:16,122
We lived on farms
and then we lived in cities,

2190
01:48:16,190 --> 01:48:18,158
and now we're going to live on the Internet!

2191
01:48:18,225 --> 01:48:21,888
Sean, stop.
I think something's going on downstairs.

2192
01:48:30,971 --> 01:48:33,735
Ladies and gentlemen,
can I have your attention, please?

2193
01:48:33,841 --> 01:48:37,072
It's time for you to go home.
The party is over.

2194
01:48:37,411 --> 01:48:39,242
Then it's all good.

2195
01:48:41,015 --> 01:48:42,073
- It's the cops.
- What?

2196
01:48:42,182 --> 01:48:43,206
Shit! Shit.

2197
01:48:43,317 --> 01:48:47,048
- Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
- Okay, it's okay. Be cool.

2198
01:48:47,588 --> 01:48:49,749
Good to see you, Officer.
What can I do for you?

2199
01:48:50,991 --> 01:48:52,015
What's going on?

2200
01:48:52,092 --> 01:48:54,686
Was the music too loud?
We were having a celebration.

2201
01:48:54,762 --> 01:48:56,320
Miss, I need you to button your blouse.

2202
01:48:56,397 --> 01:48:59,195
I can tell them to turn the music down.

2203
01:49:03,103 --> 01:49:04,161
That's not mine.

2204
01:49:04,571 --> 01:49:07,563
Okay, we're gonna need identification.
Keep your hands where we can see them.

2205
01:49:07,674 --> 01:49:09,073
Oh, my God.

2206
01:49:09,176 --> 01:49:10,871
You got anything else in your pockets
I should know about?

2207
01:49:10,944 --> 01:49:12,002
No, sir. No.

2208
01:49:12,079 --> 01:49:14,343
- Don't be stupid, now.
- I don't, I don't.

2209
01:49:19,420 --> 01:49:20,910
What's this?

2210
01:49:21,121 --> 01:49:22,850
That's an EpiPen.

2211
01:49:23,924 --> 01:49:26,256
- And this?
- That's my inhaler.

2212
01:49:27,094 --> 01:49:28,755
How old are you?

2213
01:49:29,363 --> 01:49:30,762
Twenty-one.

2214
01:49:31,231 --> 01:49:32,255
Twenty-one.

2215
01:49:32,366 --> 01:49:33,765
- Twenty-one.
- I'm 21.

2216
01:49:33,867 --> 01:49:35,528
Lying only makes it worse.

2217
01:49:36,904 --> 01:49:39,395
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have lied.

2218
01:49:50,417 --> 01:49:51,441
Hello.

2219
01:49:51,552 --> 01:49:54,043
Listen, something's happened.

2220
01:50:01,328 --> 01:50:02,386
Shit.

2221
01:50:02,463 --> 01:50:04,397
No, it's all right. It's gonna be all right.

2222
01:50:04,465 --> 01:50:08,458
I posted bond, and I wasn't doing anything.
I mean, I've got allergies.

2223
01:50:13,273 --> 01:50:14,297
Interns.

2224
01:50:14,408 --> 01:50:16,239
It was just a party.

2225
01:50:19,012 --> 01:50:22,413
This is gonna be news, Sean.
It's gonna be online any second.

2226
01:50:23,617 --> 01:50:24,641
I know.

2227
01:50:24,751 --> 01:50:26,412
You know with an intern...

2228
01:50:26,487 --> 01:50:28,648
No, it's cool. I have it under control.

2229
01:50:28,755 --> 01:50:30,313
I will get it under control.

2230
01:50:30,457 --> 01:50:32,789
I will call someone
and see what the next move is.

2231
01:50:32,860 --> 01:50:34,418
But this is gonna be news now.

2232
01:50:35,162 --> 01:50:37,653
You don't think Wardo
was involved, do you?

2233
01:50:37,764 --> 01:50:38,788
I mean, do you think...

2234
01:50:38,866 --> 01:50:39,958
No.

2235
01:50:40,167 --> 01:50:42,032
Or Manningham. One of them.

2236
01:50:42,136 --> 01:50:45,367
Somebody. Somebody sent the coke
in there, because it got in there.

2237
01:50:45,472 --> 01:50:47,303
You believe me. God, this is gonna be fine.

2238
01:50:52,146 --> 01:50:53,340
Right?

2239
01:50:56,116 --> 01:50:57,674
Go home, Sean.

2240
01:51:12,900 --> 01:51:14,128
<i>Mark?</i>

2241
01:51:16,003 --> 01:51:17,061
<i>Mark.</i>

2242
01:51:19,573 --> 01:51:21,234
We're done for the day.

2243
01:51:21,341 --> 01:51:23,901
Yeah. Yeah, I was just sitting here.

2244
01:51:27,581 --> 01:51:29,515
What happened to Sean?

2245
01:51:29,850 --> 01:51:32,250
He still owns 7% of the company.

2246
01:51:36,423 --> 01:51:40,689
All you had all day was that salad.
Do you wanna get something to eat?

2247
01:51:40,761 --> 01:51:42,092
I can't.

2248
01:51:49,770 --> 01:51:51,032
I'm not a bad guy.

2249
01:51:51,104 --> 01:51:52,594
I know that.

2250
01:51:53,006 --> 01:51:56,498
When there's emotional testimony,
I assume 85% of it is exaggeration.

2251
01:51:56,610 --> 01:51:58,077
And the other 15?

2252
01:51:58,178 --> 01:52:01,272
Perjury. Creation myths need a devil.

2253
01:52:04,952 --> 01:52:06,283
What happens now?

2254
01:52:07,454 --> 01:52:11,686
Sy and the others are having a steak
on University Avenue.

2255
01:52:12,192 --> 01:52:13,625
Then they'll come back up to the office,

2256
01:52:13,727 --> 01:52:17,026
and start working on a settlement
agreement to present to you.

2257
01:52:17,130 --> 01:52:19,030
- They're gonna settle?
- Oh, yeah.

2258
01:52:19,633 --> 01:52:22,466
- And you're gonna have to pay a little extra.
- Why?

2259
01:52:22,569 --> 01:52:24,730
So that these guys sign
a nondisclosure agreement.

2260
01:52:24,805 --> 01:52:27,797
They say one unflattering word about you
in public, you own their wife and kids.

2261
01:52:27,908 --> 01:52:29,102
I invented Facebook.

2262
01:52:29,209 --> 01:52:31,302
I'm talking about a jury.

2263
01:52:31,578 --> 01:52:34,138
I specialze in voir dire, jury selection.

2264
01:52:34,248 --> 01:52:36,614
What a jury sees
when they look at a defendant.

2265
01:52:36,717 --> 01:52:39,083
Clothes, hair, speaking style, likeability...

2266
01:52:39,152 --> 01:52:40,380
Likeability.

2267
01:52:40,487 --> 01:52:43,320
I've been licensed to practice law
for all of 20 months,

2268
01:52:43,423 --> 01:52:44,788
and I could get a jury to believe

2269
01:52:44,891 --> 01:52:47,587
that you planted the story
about Eduardo and the chicken.

2270
01:52:47,661 --> 01:52:48,753
Watch what else.

2271
01:52:49,263 --> 01:52:51,322
Why weren't you at Sean's sorority party
that night?

2272
01:52:52,099 --> 01:52:54,294
- You think I'm the one that called the police?
- Doesn't matter.

2273
01:52:54,401 --> 01:52:56,460
I asked the question,
now everybody's thinking about it.

2274
01:52:56,570 --> 01:52:58,663
You've lost your jury in the first 10 minutes.

2275
01:53:00,340 --> 01:53:01,466
Farm animals.

2276
01:53:01,575 --> 01:53:02,735
Yeah.

2277
01:53:03,744 --> 01:53:06,269
I was drunk and angry and stupid.

2278
01:53:06,346 --> 01:53:08,610
- And blogging.
- And blogging.

2279
01:53:09,750 --> 01:53:11,081
Pay them.

2280
01:53:11,351 --> 01:53:12,579
In the scheme of things,

2281
01:53:13,020 --> 01:53:14,351
it's a speeding ticket.

2282
01:53:16,356 --> 01:53:18,756
That's what Sy will tell you tomorrow.

2283
01:53:18,859 --> 01:53:21,760
Do you think anybody would mind if I stayed
and used the computer for a minute?

2284
01:53:21,862 --> 01:53:23,352
I can't imagine it would be a problem.

2285
01:53:23,463 --> 01:53:24,691
Thanks.

2286
01:53:25,532 --> 01:53:27,864
I appreciate your help today.

2287
01:53:31,705 --> 01:53:33,969
You're not an asshole, Mark.

2288
01:53:35,208 --> 01:53:37,699
You're just trying so hard to be.
