you used the auxiliary of deck B--

could you get this--
deck B for gamma override.

982
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:54,760
[ Alexander ]
Where's the happy ending, Jason ?

983
01:04:56,260 --> 01:04:59,200
Never give up,
never surrender.

984
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:09,800
Maybe it's about time you just backed
off, you fin-headed monstrosity.

985
01:05:09,860 --> 01:05:12,750
- [ Gwen ] Jason ?
- You what ?

986
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:17,000
You're starting to act
like you did in episode 17,

987
01:05:17,060 --> 01:05:19,110
you scene-stealing hack.

988
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:24,140
Oh, right.

989
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:27,240
Well, how does it feel, Jason ?

990
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:30,050
-Was it worth it ? You murdered us all !
-Shut up.

991
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:32,420
Hundreds to die
just because of you.

992
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:34,760
- I told you to shut up.
- Both of you, get in there.

993
01:05:34,820 --> 01:05:37,670
Hundreds to die just because
you wanna play a big commander.

994
01:05:37,730 --> 01:05:40,580
- You raving lunatic.
- Then I'll see you in hell, won't I ?

995
01:05:53,610 --> 01:05:59,110
- [ Alexander ] Look out, Jason !
- Get his gun ! Get the gun !

Sorry, I was-- Door was
a little sticky. Did you see that ?

999
01:06:17,670 --> 01:06:20,510
I'll get one of my boys up here
with a can of WD-40.

1000
01:06:24,410 --> 01:06:27,520
- You used to pull your punches.
- Scene-stealing hack, thank you.

- Raving egomaniac.
- Can't think where I got that from.

Core system's hardware damaged.

All right, listen up, this is what
we gotta do. Gwen, you and l,

1013
01:07:21,950 --> 01:07:24,250
we're gonna get to the core
and shut it down manually.

1014
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:26,170
Fred, take Guy and Laliari.
You find that valve.

1015
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:27,930
Shut it off before
those Thermians run out of air.

1016
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,230
Alexander, get to the barracks. Wedge
a door open, in case they can't do that.

1017
01:07:31,290 --> 01:07:33,370
- Okay.
- Wait, Jason. What about me ?
What do I do ?

1018
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:37,630
You're gonna practice driving.
Let's go !

1019
01:07:37,690 --> 01:07:39,550
Practice driving.

1020
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:42,780
- So we get to shut down
a neutron reactor.
- That's right.

1021
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:44,690
I hate to break it
to you, Jason,

1022
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:47,390
but I don't know how to
shut down a neutron reactor,

1023
01:07:47,450 --> 01:07:49,620
and unless you took a learning annex
course I don't know about,

1024
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:52,440
I'm pretty sure you don't know how
to shut down a neutron reactor either.

1025
01:07:52,510 --> 01:07:55,610
No, I don't,
but I know someone who does.

1026
01:07:58,390 --> 01:08:01,330
- [ Knocking ]
- Brandon, honey, garbage.

1027
01:08:01,430 --> 01:08:03,740
Aw, Mother,
I'm quite busy.

1028
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:06,100
Come on, Brandon,
don't make me ask you again.

1029

[ Sighing ] Just ten more minutes.
Okay, Ma, I promise.

day when we bumped into each other.

Oh ? Oh.

01:08:48,060 --> 01:08:50,870
- Okay.
- What's your name, son ?

[ Sighs ]
Brandon.

1041
01:08:53,460 --> 01:08:56,150
Brandon, I remember you
from the convention, right ?

1042
01:08:56,220 --> 01:08:59,700
You asked all those little
technical questions about the ship,

1043
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:01,650
and I was a little short
with you.

1044
01:09:01,740 --> 01:09:05,490
Yes, yes, I know, Commander,
and I actually wanna--

1045
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:08,820
I just wanted to tell you that
l-l thought a lot about what you said.

1046
01:09:08,890 --> 01:09:11,540
- It's okay. Listen.
- But I want you to know...

1047
01:09:11,610 --> 01:09:14,930
that I'm not a complete
brain case, okay ?

1048
01:09:15,030 --> 01:09:17,840
I understand completely
that it's just a TV show.

- H-Hold-- Wait a minute.
- [ Brandon Continues ]

Stop for a second.
Stop. Wait. It's all real.

01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:27,700
Oh, my God, I knew it.
I knew it ! I knew it !

1052
01:09:27,790 --> 01:09:31,090

and we need your help.

Quellek ?
What are you doing up there ?

1058
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:55,960
I avoided capture by using
your Mak'tar stealth face.

1059
01:09:56,010 --> 01:09:58,830
- Where is everyone ?
- Come with me.

1060
01:09:58,900 --> 01:10:01,230
I'll explain on the way.

1061
01:10:03,830 --> 01:10:06,000
All right, we're at level "C,"
hallway five. Now what ?

1062
01:10:06,070 --> 01:10:10,640
Um, go to weapons storage,
your second left, through the passage.

1063
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:13,680
And that leads to a system
of utility corridors
through the bowels of the ship.

1064
01:10:13,740 --> 01:10:16,400
- Open.
- You know, I'm gonna get Kyle.

1065
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:19,150
He knows the utility tunnel system
better than anybody alive.

1066
01:10:21,230 --> 01:10:23,080
...38, 39, 40.

1067
01:10:25,450 --> 01:10:28,520
All we have to do is
turn off the valve to the barracks.

1068
01:10:34,190 --> 01:10:36,620
- Hi, Brandon.
- No time for pleasantries, Kyle.

1069
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:40,490
We have a level five emergency.
You still got the utility systems
walk-through, right ?

1070
01:10:40,580 --> 01:10:44,070
Yeah, I've got sectors
one through twenty-eight.
Hollister has the upper levels.

1071
01:10:44,140 --> 01:10:46,020
Great.
We'll get everybody on-line.

- Pedal to the metal, Commander.
- Pedal to the metal, Commander.

01:11:00,270 --> 01:11:02,510
General !
I have just received word...

1074
01:11:02,570 --> 01:11:05,130
that the commander of the Protector
and his command crew...

1075
01:11:05,190 --> 01:11:07,280
have escaped custody.

1076
01:11:07,330 --> 01:11:09,190
What ?

1077
01:11:11,430 --> 01:11:16,460
- Find them !
- But sir ! My men--
The core implosion--

1078
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:18,720
Find them !

1079
01:11:20,330 --> 01:11:23,430
All right, Brandon, I see five ducts
in this room. Which way do we go ?

1080
01:11:23,490 --> 01:11:25,450
Enter the passage
second to your left...

1081
01:11:25,540 --> 01:11:28,490
and just continue straight
for 50 meters.

1082
01:11:28,590 --> 01:11:31,690

Why is it always ducts ?

- Ah, there will be a slight drop.

They're dying.

1086
01:11:51,820 --> 01:11:54,250
- Wait a minute.
We gotta go across this thing ?
- Yes.

1087

- Don't look down.
- What I'd give to see
what you're seeing.

1088
01:11:58,180 --> 01:12:01,960
- What are you talking about ?
- You're deep in the underbelly
of the Omega 13 !

1089
01:12:02,020 --> 01:12:04,830
Oh, it must be spectacular.

1090
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:07,590
It-It doesn't look
like much to me.

1091
01:12:07,650 --> 01:12:13,220
There's just these few walls
and this dumb spinning fan
that we have in every single--

1092
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:29,700
Brandon, what does
the Omega 13 device do ?

1093
01:12:29,770 --> 01:12:32,860
Uh, many have believed
that it is a matter collapser.

1094
01:12:32,930 --> 01:12:36,990
A bomb capable of destroying pretty much
everything in about 13 seconds.

1095
01:12:37,060 --> 01:12:40,250
- But myself and others are convinced
that what it is...
- I'm gonna go. Go.

1096
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:42,560
is a matter rearranger,

1097
01:12:42,630 --> 01:12:45,210
affecting a 13-second time jump
to the past.

1098
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:49,860
Why 13 seconds ?
That's really not enough time
to do anything of any importance.

1099
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:53,510
- It'd be time to redeem
a single mistake.
- What ?

1100
01:12:53,570 --> 01:12:57,920
- [ Lasers Blasting ]
- Go, go, go, go !

1101
01:12:58,180 --> 01:13:01,120
We-We gotta turn off that valve.
Their oxygen's almost gone.

1102
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:04,190
Listen.
I'll go in.

1103
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:06,810
I'll create a distraction.
I've got this. I'm okay.

1104
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:09,630
I'm gonna be able to hold him back
long enough for the aliens to escape.

1105
01:13:09,690 --> 01:13:13,020
- That's suicide.
- I'm just a glorified extra, Fred.

1106
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:16,800
I'm a dead man anyway. If I'm gonna die,
I'd rather go out a hero than a coward.

1107
01:13:16,870 --> 01:13:20,840
Guy, Guy, maybe you're
the plucky comic relief.

1108
01:13:20,890 --> 01:13:22,750
You ever think
about that ?

1109
01:13:23,930 --> 01:13:25,790
- Plucky ?
- Oh, besides,

1110
01:13:25,850 --> 01:13:29,180
I just had this
really interesting idea.

1111
01:13:29,270 --> 01:13:31,200
Are you stoned ?

1112
01:13:31,290 --> 01:13:34,270

and give them some time.

- Sir, perhaps together--

the Mak'tar chant of strength:
Larak tarath.

1115
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:43,380
- Larak tarath, larak tarath.
- Larak tarath.

1116
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:47,610
[ Together ] Larak tarath, larak tarath,
larak tarath, larack tarath.

1117
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:58,240
All right, Brandon, we're across.
Now what ?

1118
01:13:58,330 --> 01:14:02,210
You wanna take a left and then just
straight on through the chompers.

1119
01:14:02,300 --> 01:14:03,990
"The chompers" ?

1120
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:12,320
- Well, screw that.
- How are we supposed
to get through this ?

1121
01:14:12,370 --> 01:14:14,420
Hollister, do you have
the sequence yet ?

1122
01:14:14,490 --> 01:14:16,660
Okay, the sequence is...

1123
01:14:16,730 --> 01:14:19,380
two-two-four-two--

1124
01:14:19,450 --> 01:14:22,390
What is this thing ?
I mean, it serves no useful purpose...

1125
01:14:22,490 --> 01:14:25,780
for there to be a bunch
of chompy, crushy things
in the middle of a hallway !

1126
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:29,660
We shouldn't have to do this.
It makes no sense ! Why is it here ?

1127
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:32,350
- 'Cause it's on the television show.
- Well, forget it !

1128
01:14:32,410 --> 01:14:35,700
I am not doing it !
This episode was badly written !

1129
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:37,940
Okay, Commander, now, as soon
as the first crusher hits you--

1130

- It just did !
