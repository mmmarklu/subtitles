1
00:00:37,292 --> 00:00:42,333
On September 3rd, 1973
at 6.28 PM and 32 seconds,

2
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,250
a bluebottle fly
capable of 14,670 wingbeats a minute

3
00:00:46,375 --> 00:00:50,458
landed on Rue St Vincent, Montmartre.

4
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:58,167
At the same moment
on a restaurant terrace nearby,

5
00:00:58,292 --> 00:01:03,792
the wind magically made two glasses
dance unseen on a tablecloth.

6
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:10,042
Meanwhile, in a 5th-floor flat
on Avenue Trudaine, Paris 9,

7
00:01:10,167 --> 00:01:13,667
returning from
his best friend's funeral,

8
00:01:13,792 --> 00:01:16,375
Eugene Colere erased him
from his address book.

9
00:01:21,542 --> 00:01:24,667
At the same moment,
a sperm with one X chromosome

10
00:01:24,792 --> 00:01:27,500
belonging to Raphael Poulain

11
00:01:27,667 --> 00:01:32,042
made a dash for an egg
in his wife, Amandine.

12
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:34,750
Nine months later,

13
00:01:34,958 --> 00:01:36,250
Amelie Poulain was born.

14
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:24,625
Her father, an ex-army doctor,

15
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,083
works at a spa in Enghien.

16
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,458
Raphael Poulain dislikes:

17
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:33,667
Peeing next to someone else.
He also dislikes:

18
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:38,667
Catching scornful glances
at his sandals.

19
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:45,125
Clingy wet swimming trunks.

20
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:49,833
Raphael Poulain likes:

21
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:53,125
Peeling large strips of wallpaper.

22
00:03:55,292 --> 00:03:59,625
Lining up and shining all his shoes.

23
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:04,000
Emptying his toolbox, cleaning it out

24
00:04:04,292 --> 00:04:06,625
and putting everything back.

25
00:04:07,417 --> 00:04:11,000
Amelie's mother,
a schoolmistress from Gueugnon,

26
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,333
has always had shaky nerves.

27
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:19,333
She dislikes:
Puckered fingers in the bath.

28
00:04:20,542 --> 00:04:24,500
Having her hands touched by strangers.

29
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:28,542
Pillow marks on her cheek
in the morning.

30
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:34,000
Amandine likes:
Figure skaters' costumes on TV.

31
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:36,833
Polishing the parquet.

32
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:41,292
Emptying her handbag, cleaning it out

33
00:04:41,542 --> 00:04:43,250
and putting everything back.

34
00:04:47,542 --> 00:04:49,375
Amelie is six.

35
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,583
Like all little girls,
she'd liked to be hugged by her Daddy

36
00:04:53,792 --> 00:04:57,833
but he never touches her,
except for a monthly checkup.

37
00:04:57,958 --> 00:05:00,917
The thrill of this rare contact

38
00:05:01,042 --> 00:05:02,625
makes her heart beat like a drum.

39
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:07,958
As a result,
he thinks she has a heart defect.

40
00:05:08,167 --> 00:05:10,417
Declared unfit for school,

41
00:05:10,542 --> 00:05:13,500
Amelie is taught by her mother.

42
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:20,375
Four hens brood here henceforth.

43
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:23,083
Four hens brood...

44
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:24,833
Very good.

45
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,000
...hens fourth!

46
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:27,542
No...

47
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:30,375
Deprived of playmates,

48
00:05:30,542 --> 00:05:33,500
slung between a neurotic
and an iceberg,

49
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:36,500
Amelie retreats into her imagination.

50
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:41,750
ln this world,
LPs are made like pancakes.

51
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:47,750
The neighbor's comatose wife has chosen
to get all her life's sleep in one go.

52
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:51,333
After this,
l can stay awake day and night.

53
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:57,917
Amelie has one friend, Blubber.

54
00:05:58,042 --> 00:06:01,833
Alas, the home environment
has made Blubber suicidal.

55
00:06:20,417 --> 00:06:24,292
Blubber's suicide attempts
destroy Mother's nerves.

56
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:25,708
A decision is made.

57
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,708
Enough!

58
00:07:01,042 --> 00:07:05,792
To comfort Amelie,
her mother gives her a used lnstamatic.

59
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:20,292
Little girl!
Look what you did!

60
00:07:20,417 --> 00:07:26,250
A neighbor fools her into thinking
her camera causes accidents.

61
00:07:26,417 --> 00:07:31,750
Having taken pictures all afternoon,
Amelie is petrified.

62
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:36,125
She stares at the TV,
racked by the guilt

63
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,833
of causing a huge fire, two derailments

64
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,958
and a jumbo jet crash.

65
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:44,292
A few days later,
realizing she'd been had,

66
00:07:44,417 --> 00:07:46,417
Amelie gets her revenge.

67
00:07:57,667 --> 00:07:59,542
What...?

68
00:08:28,042 --> 00:08:29,958
One day, tragedy strikes.

69
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:34,667
Amandine takes Amelie to Notre Dame
to pray for a baby brother.

70
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:37,833
Minutes later, heaven sends

71
00:08:38,292 --> 00:08:42,458
alas, not a baby boy
but Marguerite, a tourist from Quebec,

72
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:44,667
bent on ending her life.

73
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:50,750
Amandine dies instantly.

74
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:57,375
After her mother's death,
Amelie lives alone with her father.

75
00:08:57,667 --> 00:09:01,042
His unsociable tendencies increase.

76
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,125
He's obsessed with building
a miniature shrine

77
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,292
to house his wife's ashes.

78
00:09:13,792 --> 00:09:16,833
Days, months and years go by.

79
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,167
ln such a dead world,

80
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:28,000
Amelie prefers to dream

81
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:38,667
until she's old enough to leave home.

82
00:09:38,792 --> 00:09:40,208
5 years later
she's a waitress in Montmartre,

83
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:42,208
at The Two Windmills.

84
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:45,833
lt is August 29th.

85
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:49,500
ln 48 hours,
her life will change forever.

86
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:54,417
But she doesn't know it yet.

87
00:09:54,542 --> 00:09:58,708
She lives quietly
among her co-workers and regulars.

88
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:00,500
Suzanne, the owner,

89
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:03,292
limps a little
but never spills a drink.

90
00:10:03,417 --> 00:10:05,167
A former bareback artiste, she likes:

91
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:07,708
Athletes who cry with disappointment.

92
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:14,500
She dislikes: Seeing men humiliated
in front of their kids.

93
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:18,667
Georgette, the tobacconist,
is a hypochondriac.

94
00:10:18,792 --> 00:10:22,625
Migraines one day,
sciatica the next.

95
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:26,333
She hates the words
''fruit of thy womb.''

96
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:30,708
Gina works with Amelie.
Her grandma was a healer.

97
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:33,250
She likes cracking bones.

98
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:36,833
She brings a kir
to Hipolito, a failed writer.

99
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:41,542
He likes seeing bullfighters
gored on TV.

100
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:47,000
Scowling at them is Joseph,
Gina's rejected lover.

101
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,625
He's always jealously spying on her.

102
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:53,500
All he likes is popping bubble-wrap.

103
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:56,000
Here's Philomene, an air hostess.

104
00:10:56,167 --> 00:10:59,792
Amelie keeps her cat when she's away.

105
00:10:59,917 --> 00:11:03,125
Philomene likes the sound of
the cat's bowl on the tiles.

106
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:06,875
The cat likes
overhearing children's stories.

107
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,292
No thanks, m'am.
l never work Sundays.

108
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:17,417
On weekends, Amelie often takes
a train to see her father.

109
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:24,000
- Why not use your retirement?
- To do what?

110
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:27,000
Travel. You've never been away.

111
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:30,417
When we were young,
your mother and l longed to travel.

112
00:11:30,542 --> 00:11:33,333
We couldn't. Because of your heart.

113
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,042
l know.

114
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:40,042
So now... Now...

115
00:11:40,292 --> 00:11:42,667
Some Fridays, Amelie sees a movie.

116
00:11:42,792 --> 00:11:46,625
l like looking back
at people's faces in the dark!

117
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:57,417
l like noticing details
that no one else sees.

118
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:04,333
But l hate it in old movies,
when drivers don't watch the road.

119
00:12:09,542 --> 00:12:11,458
Amelie has no boyfriend.

120
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:15,708
She tried once or twice,
but the results were a letdown.

121
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:19,167
lnstead, she cultivates
a taste for small pleasures:

122
00:12:19,292 --> 00:12:23,208
Dipping her hand into sacks of grain.

123
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:27,917
Cracking creme brulee with a teaspoon.

124
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:35,500
Skimming stones on St Martin's Canal.

125
00:13:16,292 --> 00:13:18,375
They call him the Glass Man.

126
00:13:18,542 --> 00:13:22,250
He was born with bones
as brittle as crystal.

127
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:25,042
All his furniture is padded.

128
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:29,208
A handshake could crush his fingers.

129
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,417
He's stayed indoors for 20 years.

130
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:36,875
Time has changed nothing.

131
00:13:37,042 --> 00:13:39,125
Amelie still seeks solitude.

132
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,042
She amuses herself
with silly questions

133
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:43,167
about the world below,

134
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:47,542
such as ''How many couples
are having an orgasm now?''

135
00:13:58,375 --> 00:13:59,458
Fifteen!

136
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,167
Finally, on August 30th 1997,

137
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:08,625
comes the event
that changes her life forever.

138
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:14,708
Lady Di, Princess of Wales,
died in a car crash last night

139
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:18,833
with her companion, Dodi Al-Fayed...

140
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:22,500
and driver all died

141
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:25,083
the body gaurd is badly wounded

142
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:29,167
Lady Di and Al-Fayed arrived yesterday

143
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:32,167
The hotel is owned by Al-Fayeds

144
00:14:32,292 --> 00:14:35,833
They took the black Mercedes

145
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,167
followed by the reporter

146
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,833
Only the discoverer
of Tutankhamen's tomb

147
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,333
would know how she felt

148
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:20,708
upon finding this treasure,
hidden by a little boy 40 years ago.

149
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:29,458
On August 31st at 4 AM,
Amelie had a dazzling idea.

150
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:32,208
Wherever he was,
she would find the box's owner

151
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:34,292
and give him back his treasure.

152
00:15:34,417 --> 00:15:40,333
lf he was touched,
she'd become a regular do-gooder.

153
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:44,458
lf not, too bad.

154
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:55,750
The girl from the 5th floor!
We don't see much of you.

155
00:15:55,875 --> 00:16:00,250
Would you know of a boy
who lived in my flat in the 50's?

156
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:03,667
A boy? Have a glass of port.

157
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:07,000
- No thanks.
- Come in! Close the door.

158
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:10,125
Boys? l've known so many.

159
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:16,292
They're cute, until they discover
snowballs and chestnuts.

160
00:16:16,417 --> 00:16:17,792
l've known so many boys.

161
00:16:17,917 --> 00:16:20,167
When did you come here?

162
00:16:20,292 --> 00:16:24,333
ln '64. You'll have heard the story.

163
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,833
No...

164
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:29,583
l'm amazed. Sit down.

165
00:16:29,917 --> 00:16:33,500
My husband worked
for Ladybird lnsurance.

166
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:36,542
lt's no secret
he slept with his secretary.

167
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,833
They used every hotel around.

168
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,958
Not cheap ones, either.

169
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:45,250
The bimbo liked spreading her legs,

170
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,708
but only on satin.

171
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:51,042
So he swiped from the till.

172
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:54,083
A little at first, then 50 million.

173
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:57,333
Off they flew to Panama.

174
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:00,292
Drink up!

175
00:17:02,042 --> 00:17:04,917
On January 20th 1970,

176
00:17:05,042 --> 00:17:07,833
my doorbell rang.

177
00:17:08,292 --> 00:17:11,292
''Your husband's been killed
in a car crash in South America.''

178
00:17:11,417 --> 00:17:13,750
My life stopped there.

179
00:17:14,042 --> 00:17:18,708
Black Lion died of heartbreak.

180
00:17:21,042 --> 00:17:30,083
Poor creature! See how lovingly
he stares at his master?

181
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:32,417
l'll read you his letters.

182
00:17:32,542 --> 00:17:35,667
Don't go! You can spare 5 minutes.

183
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:40,417
He wrote this
from the army camp.

184
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:43,917
''Darling Mado.''

185
00:17:44,042 --> 00:17:45,833
That's me, Madeleine.

186
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:48,917
''l can't sleep, can't eat,

187
00:17:49,042 --> 00:17:54,333
''knowing that my only reason to live
is far away in Paris

188
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:57,750
''and l won't see her until next Friday,

189
00:17:57,875 --> 00:18:02,000
''when my sweet little weasel
appears at the station

190
00:18:02,167 --> 00:18:05,542
''in her blue dress...''

191
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:10,583
in brackets ''the one you think
is too transparent.''

192
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,167
Did anyone ever write you that?

193
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:24,750
l'm nobody's little weasel.

194
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:27,125
My name's Madeleine Wells.

195
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:30,833
Madeleine, like Mary Magdalene.

196
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:33,125
She wept, right?

197
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:38,792
Wells, as in water.
Talk about being born to cry!

198
00:18:41,542 --> 00:18:43,875
About your question...

199
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,542
Ask Collignon, the grocer.
He's lived here all his life.

200
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:51,792
Hello, Amelie-mellow!

201
00:18:51,917 --> 00:18:54,625
A fig and three nuts, as usual?

202
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,583
Who lived in my flat in the 50's?

203
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:59,250
What was their name?

204
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:01,375
You've got me there, dear.

205
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:05,458
ln 1950, l was two.
The mental age of this cretin.

206
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:07,083
The ''cretin'' is Lucien.

207
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:10,458
He's no genius but Amelie likes him.
She likes the way

208
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:13,375
he handles each endive
like a precious object

209
00:19:13,542 --> 00:19:15,333
to be treated with care.
lt's his way of showing

210
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:19,000
his love of good work.

211
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:24,125
Look at him!
Like he's nursing a baby bird!

212
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,750
Don't ask him for currants.

213
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:29,375
You'd be here till Monday!

214
00:19:30,417 --> 00:19:32,792
Get moving, spastic!

215
00:19:32,917 --> 00:19:35,167
She hasn't got all day!

216
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:43,250
Go see my mother.
She has an elephant's memory.

217
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:45,625
Elephant-m'am!

218
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:47,667
Thank you.

219
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:08,000
Bredoteau.

220
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:10,875
Pardon?

221
00:20:11,042 --> 00:20:13,125
The name you're after.

222
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:16,833
But if l say it, it won't count.
l'm senile.

223
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,917
lgnore him, he's senile.

224
00:20:20,042 --> 00:20:22,375
See what he's done to my laurel?

225
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,792
His old job
was punching metro tickets.

226
00:20:28,917 --> 00:20:34,875
Now he gets up every night
to punch holes in my laurel!

227
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,500
Too bad it's not hardy.

228
00:20:36,667 --> 00:20:40,792
We all need a way to relax.

229
00:20:40,917 --> 00:20:42,500
l skim stones.

230
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:45,000
- You do?
- l'll find it, don't worry.

231
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:46,458
l'm very organized.

232
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:47,500
- l file everything.
- Like what?

233
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:52,000
Your son's nearly 50, and l'm still
doing his bookkeeping!

234
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,958
You were still squeezing
his toothpaste at 15.

235
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:58,833
lt follows.

236
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:05,292
Camus... 2nd floor.
Brossard was on B block.

237
00:21:05,417 --> 00:21:09,708
Got it! Bredoteau. 5th floor.

238
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:12,333
They were northerners.

239
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,667
Bredoteau. What more l can say?

240
00:21:42,542 --> 00:21:54,500
...how could l live?

241
00:21:54,625 --> 00:22:00,500
Never to know
the joy that you give

242
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:09,042
When l'm in your arms l'm under your charms

243
00:22:09,167 --> 00:22:18,458
How could l live without you?

244
00:22:19,292 --> 00:22:23,167
Groping under the photo booth
is Nino Quincampoix.

245
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:32,250
When Amelie lacked playmates,
Nino had too many.

246
00:22:43,708 --> 00:22:46,500
5 miles apart, they both dreamed

247
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:49,625
of having a brother and sister

248
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:51,250
to be with all the time.

249
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:16,458
Hi, Dad. A new friend?

250
00:23:17,042 --> 00:23:18,917
l've had him for years.

251
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:22,625
Your mother hated him,
so he lived in the toolshed.

252
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:26,292
There. Let's reconcile them.

253
00:23:28,792 --> 00:23:31,458
How about that?

254
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:40,042
Dad, if you found a precious relic
from your childhood,

255
00:23:40,167 --> 00:23:48,333
how would you feel?
Happy? Sad? Nostalgic?

256
00:23:48,667 --> 00:23:50,708
This gnome isn't a relic.

257
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:52,667
He was a retirement gift
from my old regiment.

258
00:23:52,792 --> 00:23:58,125
No, l mean something you hid
like a secret treasure.

259
00:23:58,375 --> 00:24:01,708
l should varnish him
before the autumn.

260
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:07,083
l'll make some tea. You want some?

261
00:24:07,208 --> 00:24:10,875
Breathe in, hold still.

262
00:24:11,042 --> 00:24:12,917
Better now?

263
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:15,500
Shut the door!

264
00:24:15,667 --> 00:24:17,083
There's a howling gale!

265
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:19,125
lt's not Siberia.

266
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:21,708
You're not allergic to car fumes!

267
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:25,708
l almost coughed up
my pleura last night.

268
00:24:25,917 --> 00:24:27,625
Cough up a pleura?

269
00:24:27,958 --> 00:24:31,000
- What's on today, Suzanne?
- Endives au gratin.

270
00:24:31,542 --> 00:24:34,167
They'll have you on your knees.

271
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:35,167
That's good?

272
00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:37,917
- Depends where.
- Kneel at the toilet...

273
00:24:38,042 --> 00:24:39,292
Not good!

274
00:24:44,125 --> 00:24:48,917
12.15: Laughs orgasmically
to attract alpha male.

275
00:24:49,042 --> 00:24:50,917
He's gonna drive me berserk.

276
00:24:51,042 --> 00:24:55,667
Can't he give up?
There are plenty of other bars!

277
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,875
Suzanne?

278
00:24:58,042 --> 00:25:03,750
''Au gratin'' means white sauce, right?

279
00:25:03,875 --> 00:25:05,000
Yes, why?

280
00:25:05,208 --> 00:25:09,792
l can't stomach it.
Like you and horsemeat.

281
00:25:09,917 --> 00:25:14,542
lt's not my stomach, it's my memory.

282
00:25:14,708 --> 00:25:16,167
l'd rather cook human flesh.

283
00:25:16,333 --> 00:25:17,750
You're kidding!

284
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:33,250
Can l leave early today?

285
00:25:33,792 --> 00:25:35,292
What's his name?

286
00:25:35,417 --> 00:25:37,250
Dominique Bredoteau.

287
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:45,167
Good afternoon.

288
00:25:46,292 --> 00:25:47,708
You're Dominique Bredoteau?

289
00:25:47,833 --> 00:25:49,750
That's me. Why?

290
00:25:49,958 --> 00:25:55,792
lt's about... the petition.

291
00:25:56,042 --> 00:25:57,250
Petition?

292
00:25:57,625 --> 00:26:05,125
The petition to... To canonize Lady Di!

293
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:08,250
No thanks.

294
00:26:22,917 --> 00:26:24,042
Hello?

295
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:27,167
Ladies and gentlemen,
sorry to bother you...

296
00:26:27,333 --> 00:26:30,042
l'm looking for Dominique Bredoteau.
For the European census.

297
00:26:30,292 --> 00:26:32,417
Come up. Third floor.

298
00:26:42,542 --> 00:26:44,542
Hello, kitten.

299
00:26:46,917 --> 00:26:50,583
Earl Grey, jasmine?

300
00:26:51,833 --> 00:26:53,583
What will you have?

301
00:26:57,375 --> 00:26:58,625
l'm busy.

302
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:10,500
Coming!

303
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:14,833
Where can l find Dominique Bredoteau?

304
00:27:15,792 --> 00:27:22,000
Poor dear! You just missed him.

305
00:27:22,167 --> 00:27:25,042
Look, there he goes now.

306
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,083
Bretodeau. Not Bredoteau.

307
00:27:38,042 --> 00:27:42,167
You need a little mulled wine.

308
00:27:42,333 --> 00:27:45,458
Come in.

309
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:51,833
l've lived here for 4 years.
l never saw you before.

310
00:27:52,875 --> 00:27:54,792
l never go out on the landing.

311
00:27:54,917 --> 00:27:57,833
l'm fussy about who l meet.

312
00:27:57,958 --> 00:28:01,875
They're all bums.

313
00:28:03,625 --> 00:28:04,667
Come in.

314
00:28:04,958 --> 00:28:10,542
They call me the Glass Man

315
00:28:11,667 --> 00:28:15,333
but my name is Raymond Dufayel.

316
00:28:16,375 --> 00:28:22,208
- Amelie Poulain. l'm a waitress at...
- The Two Windmills, l know.

317
00:28:22,375 --> 00:28:25,417
And right now,
your Bredoteau basket is empty.

318
00:28:25,542 --> 00:28:32,708
Because it's not ''do'', it's ''to''.
Like ''Toto''.

319
00:28:32,875 --> 00:28:34,000
Thanks!

320
00:28:37,875 --> 00:28:39,458
l love that painting.

321
00:28:39,583 --> 00:28:45,458
lt's the Luncheon of the Boating Party.
By Renoir.

322
00:28:51,042 --> 00:28:55,667
l've painted one each year
for twenty years.

323
00:28:56,625 --> 00:28:59,833
The hardest part is the looks.

324
00:28:59,958 --> 00:29:02,375
l sometimes feel they deliberately
change their mood behind my back.

325
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:05,167
They look quite happy.

326
00:29:05,333 --> 00:29:07,167
They should be!

327
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:12,375
They're eating hare with morels

328
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:16,125
and waffles with jam for the kids.

329
00:29:18,083 --> 00:29:23,167
Now, where's that piece of paper?

330
00:29:24,542 --> 00:29:28,667
You've noticed my video camera.

331
00:29:28,792 --> 00:29:31,708
A gift from my sister-in-law.

332
00:29:31,875 --> 00:29:37,583
l put it there
so l don't need to wind up my clocks.

333
00:29:39,167 --> 00:29:46,250
After all these years,
the only person l still can't capture

334
00:29:46,375 --> 00:29:51,792
is the girl with the glass of water.

335
00:29:51,917 --> 00:29:54,500
She's in the middle, yet she's outside.

336
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:58,042
Maybe she's just different.

337
00:29:58,333 --> 00:30:00,000
ln what way?

338
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:02,583
l don't know.

339
00:30:04,042 --> 00:30:09,000
When she was little,
she rarely played with other kids.

340
00:30:09,958 --> 00:30:12,750
Maybe never.

341
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:24,833
Dominique Bretodeau, 27 Rue Mouffetard.
lt's for you.

342
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:30,292
Every Tuesday morning,
Dominique Bretodeau buys a chicken.

343
00:30:30,333 --> 00:30:33,792
He roasts it with potatoes.

344
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:36,583
After carving the legs and wings,

345
00:30:36,708 --> 00:30:39,917
he loves picking the hot carcass
with his fingers,

346
00:30:40,042 --> 00:30:42,833
starting with the oysters.

347
00:30:46,042 --> 00:30:51,000
But not today.
Bretodeau won't buy a chicken.

348
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:54,042
He'll go no further
than this phone booth, here.

349
00:32:03,042 --> 00:32:06,458
ln a flash, it all came back:

350
00:32:06,792 --> 00:32:10,708
Bahamontes winning
the Tour de France...

351
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,375
Aunt Josette's slips...

352
00:32:17,042 --> 00:32:20,125
and most of all, the tragic day...

353
00:32:22,125 --> 00:32:25,750
The day he won all the marbles.

354
00:32:34,583 --> 00:32:52,375
The pinch, Bretodeau!

355
00:32:59,208 --> 00:33:01,000
Cognac, please.

356
00:33:06,583 --> 00:33:08,750
Amazing, what just happened.

357
00:33:08,875 --> 00:33:10,542
lt must be my guardian angel.

358
00:33:10,708 --> 00:33:17,042
The phone booth was calling me...

359
00:33:20,042 --> 00:33:23,375
Same here!
The microwave's calling me.

360
00:33:26,375 --> 00:33:28,083
l'll have another cognac.

361
00:33:37,208 --> 00:33:40,125
Life's funny.

362
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:45,708
To a kid, time always drags.
Suddenly you're 50.

363
00:33:48,042 --> 00:33:55,458
All that's left of your childhood
fits in a rusty little box.

364
00:33:57,125 --> 00:33:59,333
You got kids, Miss?

365
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:06,542
l have a daughter about your age.

366
00:34:10,083 --> 00:34:12,917
We haven't spoken for years.

367
00:34:13,208 --> 00:34:18,542
l heard she had a child, a boy.
His name is Lucas.

368
00:34:24,958 --> 00:34:30,708
lt's time l looked them up,
before l'm in a box myself.

369
00:34:30,875 --> 00:34:33,125
Don't you think?

370
00:34:40,292 --> 00:34:44,000
Amelie suddenly has
a strange feeling of absolute harmony.

371
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:46,042
lt's a perfect moment. Soft light,

372
00:34:46,208 --> 00:34:49,958
a scent in the air,
the quiet murmur of the city...

373
00:34:50,083 --> 00:34:54,250
She breathes deeply.
Life is simple and clear.

374
00:34:54,375 --> 00:34:59,792
A surge of love,
an urge to help mankind comes over her.

375
00:35:12,875 --> 00:35:15,792
Let me help you.
Step down. Here we go!

376
00:35:15,917 --> 00:35:17,667
The drum major's widow!

377
00:35:17,792 --> 00:35:19,833
She's worn his coat
since the day he died.

378
00:35:19,958 --> 00:35:23,750
The horse's head has lost an ear!

379
00:35:23,875 --> 00:35:27,708
That's the florist laughing.
He has crinkly eyes.

380
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:30,042
ln the bakery window, lollipops!

381
00:35:30,208 --> 00:35:32,333
Smell that!

382
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,792
They're giving out melon slices.

383
00:35:34,917 --> 00:35:36,708
Sugarplum ice cream!

384
00:35:36,875 --> 00:35:39,042
We're passing the pork butcher.

385
00:35:39,208 --> 00:35:42,167
Ham, 79 francs.
Spareribs, 45!

386
00:35:42,333 --> 00:35:49,167
Now the cheese shop.
Picodons are 12.90. Cabecous 23.50.

387
00:35:49,292 --> 00:35:53,042
A baby's watching a dog
that's watching the chickens!

388
00:35:53,208 --> 00:35:56,333
Now we're at the kiosk by the metro.

389
00:35:56,458 --> 00:35:59,125
l'll leave you here. Bye!

390
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:54,167
''She can't relate to other people.''

391
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,875
''She was always a lonely child.''

392
00:37:00,875 --> 00:37:04,208
On a sparkling evening in July,

393
00:37:04,375 --> 00:37:07,167
while on the beaches, holiday hordes

394
00:37:07,292 --> 00:37:09,875
relax in the new-found sun

395
00:37:10,042 --> 00:37:11,625
and Paris's sweltering denizens

396
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:16,042
gaze at the starbursts
of the traditional fireworks,

397
00:37:16,458 --> 00:37:22,292
Amelie Poulain, Godmother of Outcasts,
Madonna of the Unloved,

398
00:37:22,417 --> 00:37:26,000
finally succumbed to exhaustion.

399
00:37:26,667 --> 00:37:28,958
ln Paris's stricken streets,

400
00:37:29,083 --> 00:37:32,042
a countless throng of mourners

401
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:34,667
lined her funeral route
in silence

402
00:37:34,833 --> 00:37:40,833
with the measureless grief
of newly orphaned children.

403
00:37:41,875 --> 00:37:44,250
What a strange destiny for one

404
00:37:44,375 --> 00:37:47,417
who gave her all,

405
00:37:47,542 --> 00:37:51,042
yet took such joy
in life's simple pleasures.

406
00:37:51,708 --> 00:37:55,125
Like Don Quixote, she pitted herself

407
00:37:55,292 --> 00:37:58,708
against the grinding windmill
of all life's miseries.

408
00:38:10,542 --> 00:38:13,833
lt was a losing battle

409
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,708
that claimed her life too soon.
At barely 23, Amelie Poulain

410
00:38:19,875 --> 00:38:24,333
let her young, tired body merge

411
00:38:25,625 --> 00:38:29,167
with the ebb and flow of universal woe.

412
00:38:29,333 --> 00:38:32,708
As she went, she felt a stab of regret
for letting her father die

413
00:38:32,875 --> 00:38:35,458
without trying to give
his stifled life

414
00:38:35,583 --> 00:38:37,708
the breath of air she had given

415
00:38:37,875 --> 00:38:41,000
to so many others.

416
00:41:07,542 --> 00:41:18,125
Wait!

417
00:41:57,458 --> 00:42:03,500
Pages full of dud lD photos
torn up and discarded by their owners,

418
00:42:03,667 --> 00:42:06,833
carefully reassembled by some oddball.

419
00:42:07,875 --> 00:42:10,167
Some family album!

420
00:42:14,042 --> 00:42:15,417
A pack of Gauloises.

421
00:42:15,542 --> 00:42:17,333
Just a second.
lt's so smoky in here!

422
00:42:17,458 --> 00:42:21,125
Where are they?
l can't see a thing.

423
00:42:21,375 --> 00:42:24,667
More to the left. More...

424
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,125
You need change...

425
00:42:30,375 --> 00:42:31,000
Forget it.

426
00:42:32,417 --> 00:42:33,708
A mauresque for the young man.

427
00:42:33,875 --> 00:42:39,792
One kir, one mauresque
and two mint sodas.

428
00:42:40,167 --> 00:42:42,833
Was that prenuptial
or postcoital smooching?

429
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,250
Are you a congenital schmuck?

430
00:42:46,875 --> 00:42:49,917
- Prenuptial.
- Don't worry!

431
00:42:50,042 --> 00:42:52,292
You'll find your Mr Right one day.

432
00:42:52,417 --> 00:42:55,667
All women want to sleep
on a man's shoulder.

433
00:42:55,833 --> 00:42:57,417
Yes, l don't against this.

434
00:42:57,542 --> 00:42:59,250
All men snore after a few drinks

435
00:42:59,375 --> 00:43:00,833
and l have a musical ear.

436
00:43:00,958 --> 00:43:03,375
l had my nasal cavities fixed.

437
00:43:04,083 --> 00:43:06,750
l see you're a born romantic.

438
00:43:08,417 --> 00:43:11,458
l see you've never known true love.

439
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:15,292
l did. lt shortened my leg.

440
00:43:16,292 --> 00:43:19,083
l thought you fell off a horse.
l did.

441
00:43:19,208 --> 00:43:21,958
l was in love with a trapeze artist.

442
00:43:22,083 --> 00:43:26,500
Stupid me!
They always drop you at the last minute.

443
00:43:26,625 --> 00:43:29,750
He dropped me just before my act.

444
00:43:29,875 --> 00:43:33,792
lt floored me. Plus the horse,

445
00:43:33,917 --> 00:43:37,000
with me under it.

446
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:42,750
The mauresque?

447
00:43:42,875 --> 00:43:46,167
Still, true love does exist.

448
00:43:46,333 --> 00:43:49,167
l know.
After 30 years behind a bar,

449
00:43:49,292 --> 00:43:54,125
l'm an expert.
l'll even give you the recipe.

450
00:43:56,042 --> 00:43:58,500
Take two regulars,

451
00:43:58,792 --> 00:44:01,833
mix them together and let them stew.

452
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,625
lt never fails.

453
00:44:12,708 --> 00:44:16,000
Excuse me!

454
00:44:16,167 --> 00:44:17,208
l'll go.

455
00:44:21,083 --> 00:44:23,792
Haven't you hurt enough people?

456
00:44:26,833 --> 00:44:28,750
Gina can defend herself.

457
00:44:28,875 --> 00:44:32,458
l don't mean Gina. l mean Georgette.

458
00:44:35,167 --> 00:44:36,250
Georgette?

459
00:44:36,417 --> 00:44:40,125
Look! She craves your attention

460
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:42,000
but all you can see is Gina.

461
00:44:43,917 --> 00:44:46,792
Poor girl! The things she does

462
00:44:46,917 --> 00:44:49,500
to catch your eye!

463
00:44:51,333 --> 00:44:53,667
You really must be blind.

464
00:45:02,042 --> 00:45:04,208
l'm off on a date. Bye!

465
00:45:04,375 --> 00:45:05,750
Bye.

466
00:45:08,542 --> 00:45:11,083
Whoever her new one is,

467
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:14,833
he can't be worse than that nut
with his tape recorder.

468
00:45:15,708 --> 00:45:19,917
Joseph's not so nutty.
He's just in pain.

469
00:45:20,542 --> 00:45:23,833
Come on! They split up two months ago.

470
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,458
To keep on coming here,
he must be a masochist.

471
00:45:28,083 --> 00:45:31,500
Don't say you haven't noticed.

472
00:45:31,625 --> 00:45:33,708
Noticed what?

473
00:45:34,292 --> 00:45:36,292
He always sits here, right?

474
00:45:36,417 --> 00:45:37,500
Right.

475
00:45:37,625 --> 00:45:41,250
Sit down. Sit down, Georgette.

476
00:45:43,042 --> 00:45:44,917
What can you see?

477
00:45:45,125 --> 00:45:47,375
My cigarette counter.

478
00:45:47,542 --> 00:45:49,542
Nothing's missing?

479
00:45:49,708 --> 00:45:51,625
No.

480
00:45:51,875 --> 00:45:53,625
Make an effort.

481
00:46:00,375 --> 00:46:03,667
l can't see what!

482
00:46:03,792 --> 00:46:07,000
Think about it. Good night.

483
00:46:23,417 --> 00:46:24,375
Good moring.

484
00:46:25,917 --> 00:46:31,208
Letter Arrives 30 Years Late

485
00:46:31,375 --> 00:46:34,042
A mailbag found
by climbers on a glacier

486
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:37,208
on Mont Blanc was part of a cargo

487
00:46:37,375 --> 00:46:40,458
lost in a plane crash
in the late 1960's.

488
00:46:40,792 --> 00:46:44,000
So sad!
A young, pretty princess for once.

489
00:46:44,125 --> 00:46:46,500
lt's OK if she's old and ugly?

490
00:46:46,667 --> 00:46:49,208
Sure! Look at Mother Teresa.

491
00:46:50,917 --> 00:46:53,000
ls he still chasing Gina?

492
00:46:54,333 --> 00:46:56,375
No, he likes somebody else.

493
00:46:56,917 --> 00:46:59,167
Anyone l know?

494
00:46:59,333 --> 00:47:02,667
Funny about this glacier...

495
00:47:02,792 --> 00:47:03,958
Somebody at the Two Windmills?

496
00:47:04,083 --> 00:47:05,167
Mmmm...

497
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:13,083
Not you! Not Suzanne...

498
00:47:13,875 --> 00:47:16,042
- No!
- Yes.

499
00:47:19,917 --> 00:47:22,000
There he is again.

500
00:47:22,208 --> 00:47:23,625
How strange.

501
00:47:24,333 --> 00:47:28,792
- And here.
- ''Him again!''

502
00:47:30,458 --> 00:47:31,875
''Lyon Station.''

503
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,833
And here. ''March 5th, Austerlitz.''

504
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,667
Always the same blank face.

505
00:47:38,542 --> 00:47:44,583
Twelve times. l counted. lt's very odd.

506
00:47:44,708 --> 00:47:47,500
Why keep taking your picture
all over town

507
00:47:47,667 --> 00:47:49,458
and throw them away?

508
00:47:49,583 --> 00:47:52,500
Good ones, too.
lt's like a ritual.

509
00:47:52,958 --> 00:48:00,500
He's probably terrified of growing old.
lt's his only consolation.

510
00:48:02,292 --> 00:48:04,000
He's dead!

511
00:48:05,042 --> 00:48:06,042
Dead?

512
00:48:06,333 --> 00:48:09,667
He's scared of being forgotten.

513
00:48:09,833 --> 00:48:12,833
He wants to remind people of his face.

514
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Like faxing his portrait
from the afterlife.

515
00:48:17,167 --> 00:48:21,875
A dead man scared of being forgotten.

516
00:48:22,083 --> 00:48:25,042
These guys here... have it made!

517
00:48:25,208 --> 00:48:28,042
They're long dead

518
00:48:28,208 --> 00:48:31,125
but they'll never be forgotten.

519
00:48:33,208 --> 00:48:35,000
The girl with the glass...

520
00:48:35,167 --> 00:48:39,417
Maybe her thoughts
are with somebody else.

521
00:48:39,542 --> 00:48:41,542
Somebody in the picture?

522
00:48:43,042 --> 00:48:47,292
More likely a boy she saw somewhere

523
00:48:47,417 --> 00:48:50,333
and felt an affinity with.

524
00:48:50,667 --> 00:48:52,708
You mean she'd rather imagine herself

525
00:48:52,875 --> 00:48:55,917
relating to an absent person

526
00:48:56,042 --> 00:49:01,083
than build relationships
with those around her?

527
00:49:03,167 --> 00:49:09,333
Maybe she tries hard
to fix other people's messy lives.

528
00:49:10,042 --> 00:49:14,792
What about her? Her own messy life?

529
00:49:15,542 --> 00:49:17,208
Who'll fix that?

530
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,958
lt's better to help people
than a garden gnome.

531
00:50:34,458 --> 00:50:39,625
The trucker had 2.8 grams
of alcohol in his blood!

532
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:42,250
Makes me sick!

533
00:50:42,375 --> 00:50:44,417
Talk about employing
irresponsible morons!

534
00:50:44,542 --> 00:50:47,125
- Your keys...
- Hold on, Mello.

535
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:48,792
Speed kills nowadays.

536
00:50:48,917 --> 00:50:50,000
Model yourself on Lucien.

537
00:50:50,125 --> 00:50:55,792
No radar will ever catch him
while he's working!

538
00:50:55,917 --> 00:50:57,167
Shame on you, Mr Collignon.

539
00:50:57,333 --> 00:51:00,417
lt's not his fault.

540
00:51:00,542 --> 00:51:03,042
True, Mrs Cauchoix!

541
00:51:03,167 --> 00:51:06,500
lt's not his fault he can't sleep.
lt's Lady Di's!

542
00:51:08,167 --> 00:51:13,167
Guess what l found in the truck.
A lingerie catalog!

543
00:51:13,333 --> 00:51:16,583
He'd pasted Lady Di's face
over the model's!

544
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:20,042
What today? Five asparagus

545
00:51:20,208 --> 00:51:22,542
or more local history?

546
00:51:22,917 --> 00:51:23,500
Nothing.

547
00:51:31,167 --> 00:51:34,458
*KEYS CUT
WHlLE YOU WAlT

548
00:51:46,833 --> 00:51:51,542
The migraine's better?

549
00:51:51,708 --> 00:51:54,500
Yes, but my sciatica
kept me awake all night.

550
00:51:54,667 --> 00:51:55,667
lt's ages since l saw you

551
00:51:55,833 --> 00:51:58,292
looking so good.

552
00:51:58,458 --> 00:51:59,833
Yes?

553
00:52:00,042 --> 00:52:05,333
''A woman without love wilts
like a flower without sun.''

554
00:52:10,208 --> 00:52:12,583
Strange weather today!

555
00:52:12,708 --> 00:52:13,708
What's so funny?

556
00:52:13,833 --> 00:52:19,958
You're only the 100th one to say it.

557
00:52:20,083 --> 00:52:23,542
We pass the time of day
to forget how time passes.

558
00:52:23,708 --> 00:52:25,292
We do it to keep
from talking crap.

559
00:52:25,417 --> 00:52:26,667
l write crap that nobody publishes.

560
00:52:26,833 --> 00:52:29,042
- Another rejection?
- My 30th!

561
00:52:29,208 --> 00:52:31,292
lsn't your cousin a book critic?

562
00:52:31,417 --> 00:52:33,167
Forget it! Critics are like leeches,

563
00:52:33,292 --> 00:52:37,708
sucking the blood of writers.

564
00:52:37,833 --> 00:52:41,958
ls your book a love story?

565
00:52:42,208 --> 00:52:44,667
lt's about a guy
who keeps a journal.

566
00:52:44,792 --> 00:52:46,792
Not about his past,

567
00:52:46,958 --> 00:52:49,458
but about disasters in his future.

568
00:52:49,625 --> 00:52:53,125
So he gets depressed and does nothing.

569
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:55,792
Basically, it's about a loafer.

570
00:52:56,292 --> 00:52:59,167
l'll dedicate the manuscript to you.

571
00:52:59,292 --> 00:53:03,458
So you'll write off his tab!

572
00:53:03,583 --> 00:53:07,417
His scribbles for my nibbles.
That's sponsorship.

573
00:53:10,708 --> 00:53:12,792
Ms. Suzanne, thank you!

574
00:53:13,333 --> 00:53:15,667
What took you so long?

575
00:53:16,083 --> 00:53:17,875
Look at the time!

576
00:53:19,292 --> 00:53:22,000
Somebody peed in his mother!

577
00:55:23,625 --> 00:55:32,833
''Without you, today's emotions
would be the scurf of yesterday's.''

578
00:55:33,042 --> 00:55:34,125
What are you saying?

579
00:55:34,667 --> 00:55:39,292
Without you, today's emotions
would be the scurf of yesterday's.

580
00:55:40,375 --> 00:55:41,667
Tickets please.

581
00:55:45,708 --> 00:55:47,833
How's work?

582
00:55:48,708 --> 00:55:50,167
You asked me already.

583
00:55:50,292 --> 00:55:55,917
You're okay these days?

584
00:55:56,542 --> 00:56:01,375
Pretty much. l feel a change...

585
00:56:05,208 --> 00:56:07,042
l had 2 heart attacks,
an abortion,

586
00:56:07,208 --> 00:56:10,042
did crack while l was pregnant.

587
00:56:11,792 --> 00:56:13,583
Other than that, l'm fine.

588
00:56:13,875 --> 00:56:17,375
Good.

589
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:20,875
Something wrong?

590
00:56:21,583 --> 00:56:23,042
No, nothing.

591
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:29,167
Your gnome's gone.

592
00:56:30,292 --> 00:56:32,292
ls he back in the toolshed?

593
00:56:45,542 --> 00:56:48,333
Moscow. No explanation.

594
00:56:49,625 --> 00:56:52,000
lt is strange!

595
00:56:52,958 --> 00:56:55,750
He wants
to see the world?

596
00:56:58,542 --> 00:57:02,833
l can't understand it.

597
00:57:18,417 --> 00:57:18,958
LOST

598
00:57:19,083 --> 00:57:19,667
BAG

599
00:57:19,792 --> 00:57:20,583
PHOTOS

600
00:57:24,875 --> 00:57:28,042
Any normal girl would call the number,

601
00:57:28,375 --> 00:57:30,958
meet him, return the album

602
00:57:31,083 --> 00:57:33,917
and see if her dream is viable.

603
00:57:34,042 --> 00:57:39,708
lt's called a reality check.
The last thing Amelie wants.

604
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,083
l say! Could she be falling in love?

605
00:59:23,708 --> 00:59:24,667
Where's the boss?

606
00:59:24,792 --> 00:59:27,125
Sleeping in the cauliflower.

607
00:59:27,250 --> 00:59:29,917
What?

608
00:59:30,375 --> 00:59:32,833
Sleeping in the cauliflower.

609
00:59:39,875 --> 00:59:41,667
You want me... Want what?

610
00:59:41,792 --> 00:59:44,167
A scratchcard, please.

611
00:59:52,417 --> 00:59:55,125
How does it work?

612
00:59:56,792 --> 00:59:59,125
Tell you what.

613
00:59:59,250 --> 01:00:01,292
Let's both do one together.

614
01:00:04,708 --> 01:00:09,208
You scratch it here... sideways.

615
01:00:19,125 --> 01:00:20,458
Nothing. You?

616
01:00:21,417 --> 01:00:28,417
Me neither. Unlucky at cards...

617
01:00:28,833 --> 01:00:31,375
So they say!

618
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:36,333
l have to get back.

619
01:00:36,708 --> 01:00:39,042
Bye

620
01:00:46,708 --> 01:00:49,042
Porno Video Palace.

621
01:00:49,542 --> 01:00:51,250
l'm calling about the ad.

622
01:00:51,375 --> 01:00:53,792
- You're over 18?
- Yes.

623
01:00:53,917 --> 01:00:57,000
- Shaved?
- Sorry?

624
01:00:57,167 --> 01:01:02,000
Are you shaved?
Fur pie doesn't sell.

625
01:01:20,208 --> 01:01:21,833
How's life, Mrs Wells?

626
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,042
When you've nothing to live for...

627
01:01:24,208 --> 01:01:26,583
Come on, life's great!

628
01:01:26,708 --> 01:01:28,917
Dream on, kid.

629
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:46,125
Hello, Mr Dufayel.

630
01:01:46,542 --> 01:01:50,792
Here's your order, Mr Dufayel.

631
01:01:51,167 --> 01:01:54,375
l doubt it. l hate artichokes.

632
01:01:55,042 --> 01:01:58,417
You shouldn't. Watch this.

633
01:02:09,125 --> 01:02:10,625
Take it.

634
01:02:18,708 --> 01:02:23,375
That's better.

635
01:02:23,625 --> 01:02:25,542
Lucien, you're a wizard!

636
01:02:26,208 --> 01:02:28,250
Courtesy of Mr Collignon.

637
01:02:28,375 --> 01:02:34,208
Mister Collignon?

638
01:02:34,542 --> 01:02:36,542
Sorry, it slipped out.

639
01:02:36,708 --> 01:02:39,500
Practice, Lucien! Practice!

640
01:02:39,625 --> 01:02:45,125
Repeat after me.
Collignon, down the john.

641
01:02:46,750 --> 01:02:49,042
Collignon, down the john.

642
01:02:49,208 --> 01:02:52,667
Your turn now. Collignon...

643
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:57,125
Collignon, big moron!

644
01:02:57,250 --> 01:03:00,958
See? You can do it.

645
01:03:01,083 --> 01:03:03,542
Collignon, dead and gone!

646
01:03:03,667 --> 01:03:07,708
Very good!

647
01:03:07,875 --> 01:03:09,417
Collignon, big moron, down the john!

648
01:03:09,708 --> 01:03:11,917
Collignon, big moron, down the john!

649
01:03:12,167 --> 01:03:22,417
Collignon, big moron, down the john!

650
01:03:22,542 --> 01:03:28,167
Okay! That's enough for today.
Lucien, enough! Very good.

651
01:03:31,417 --> 01:03:34,458
l found this under your mat.

652
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,833
Collignon, big moron, down the john!

653
01:04:50,167 --> 01:04:51,875
Still no win!

654
01:04:52,250 --> 01:04:54,292
Me neither.

655
01:04:56,875 --> 01:05:01,375
May l? There's a little...

656
01:05:07,208 --> 01:05:10,625
You're gorgeous when you blush.

657
01:05:11,792 --> 01:05:14,208
Like a wild flower.

658
01:05:14,375 --> 01:05:17,208
lt's my dyspepsia.

659
01:05:18,917 --> 01:05:23,167
Morning, all! Beautiful day!

660
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:46,667
Pack of Gitanes, please.

661
01:05:46,833 --> 01:05:49,917
Bravo! Vive la France!
You scalded me!

662
01:05:50,042 --> 01:05:53,333
Ten out of ten! Bullseye!

663
01:06:31,958 --> 01:06:34,958
lt was Amelie, she...

664
01:06:35,583 --> 01:06:39,625
When they went up Mont Blanc...
the silicon in her face froze up.

665
01:06:40,125 --> 01:06:44,000
Her face was a festering mass!

666
01:07:09,167 --> 01:07:13,125
Mulled wine and spice cookies.

667
01:07:13,417 --> 01:07:14,375
Thanks.

668
01:07:15,042 --> 01:07:18,958
l was too hard on the girl
with the glass.

669
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:23,750
Tell me about that boy she saw.
Did they meet again?

670
01:07:24,833 --> 01:07:29,750
They're into different things.

671
01:07:29,875 --> 01:07:32,333
Luck is like the Tour de France.

672
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:35,333
You wait, and it flashes past you.

673
01:07:36,083 --> 01:07:42,125
You have to catch it while you can.

674
01:08:04,417 --> 01:08:06,333
Can l help you?

675
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:09,500
Excuse me. l found this in the street.

676
01:08:09,667 --> 01:08:12,125
Nino will be glad!

677
01:08:12,250 --> 01:08:14,958
He was so sad the other day,

678
01:08:15,083 --> 01:08:17,167
l almost prayed to St Anthony!

679
01:08:18,292 --> 01:08:20,125
ls... Nino here now?

680
01:08:20,250 --> 01:08:23,042
On Wednesdays
he works at the funfair.

681
01:08:23,375 --> 01:08:27,250
How long has he had this collection?

682
01:08:27,542 --> 01:08:33,417
Since l got him the job here,
last year.

683
01:08:33,542 --> 01:08:36,458
Before, he collected footprints.
He worked nights.

684
01:08:36,583 --> 01:08:43,000
ln the daytime, he took pictures
of footprints in wet cement.

685
01:08:43,125 --> 01:08:48,542
He's a funny guy.
When we met, he was a Santa Claus.

686
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:51,208
Other things, like...

687
01:08:51,375 --> 01:08:55,417
Whenever he heard a funny laugh,

688
01:08:59,333 --> 01:09:01,292
he'd tape it.

689
01:09:02,375 --> 01:09:05,083
Gosh! Must be hard for his girlfriend!

690
01:09:05,208 --> 01:09:08,542
He never keeps them long.

691
01:09:08,708 --> 01:09:10,167
Times are hard for dreamers.

692
01:09:10,292 --> 01:09:13,542
Eva! Are those coffees coming?

693
01:09:13,708 --> 01:09:15,375
Gotta go. Thanks for the album.

694
01:09:15,542 --> 01:09:18,958
lt's OK.
l have time to take it to the funfair.

695
01:09:19,083 --> 01:09:23,667
Suit yourself. The Ghost Train.
Ask for Nino Quincampoix.

696
01:09:47,625 --> 01:09:49,833
ls Nino here?

697
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,583
He doesn't get off till 7.

698
01:09:53,708 --> 01:09:55,000
- ls there no way to see him before?

699
01:09:55,125 --> 01:09:58,958
- Sure. 20 francs.

700
01:11:09,750 --> 01:11:11,167
See you next Wednesday.

701
01:11:11,292 --> 01:11:13,292
5 PM tomorrow,

702
01:11:23,583 --> 01:11:28,667
Montmartre carousel.
Bring 5 francs.

703
01:11:45,917 --> 01:11:47,875
Want to know about her?

704
01:11:50,333 --> 01:11:53,292
- You know her?
- You bet!

705
01:11:53,542 --> 01:11:55,833
She put us in her shirt pocket.

706
01:11:56,208 --> 01:11:57,833
Next to her breast!

707
01:11:58,875 --> 01:12:02,125
- ls she pretty?
- Not bad.

708
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:04,917
- Beautiful.
- No, pretty.

709
01:12:05,042 --> 01:12:07,792
- Beautiful!
- Pretty.

710
01:12:08,042 --> 01:12:12,792
- What does she want from me?
- She's broke.

711
01:12:13,083 --> 01:12:15,375
She wants a reward for the album.

712
01:12:15,542 --> 01:12:17,500
Or else she collects photos, too.

713
01:12:17,667 --> 01:12:20,000
She wants to trade us
for a one-eyed man with glasses!

714
01:12:24,375 --> 01:12:29,417
No, you dope! She's in love.

715
01:12:29,542 --> 01:12:32,542
- l don't even know her.
- You do.

716
01:12:32,917 --> 01:12:34,042
Since when?

717
01:12:34,458 --> 01:12:38,000
Since always. ln your dreams.

718
01:12:51,667 --> 01:12:56,292
You! Man with the plastic bag!
lt's for you.

719
01:12:57,083 --> 01:12:59,167
For me.

720
01:13:01,875 --> 01:13:06,125
Thanks, hello?

721
01:13:07,083 --> 01:13:09,417
Follow the blue arrows,
Mr Quincampoix.

722
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:38,792
The fool looks at a finger
that points at the sky.

723
01:15:51,375 --> 01:15:52,708
Hello?

724
01:15:52,875 --> 01:15:59,500
Mr Quincampoix.
l know the stranger in the pictures.

725
01:15:59,625 --> 01:16:01,917
He's a ghost. He's invisible!

726
01:16:02,042 --> 01:16:04,125
He only appears
when the film is developed.

727
01:16:04,250 --> 01:16:06,208
When a girl has her photo taken,

728
01:16:06,375 --> 01:16:09,583
he goes ''Wooo!'' in her ear

729
01:16:09,708 --> 01:16:12,375
while he fondles her neck.

730
01:16:12,542 --> 01:16:15,500
That's how he got caught,
Mr Quincampoix!

731
01:16:18,625 --> 01:16:20,292
Who are you?

732
01:16:20,417 --> 01:16:22,000
Page 51.

733
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:36,250
DO YOU WANT TO MEET ME?

734
01:18:14,875 --> 01:18:15,833
Listen to this:

735
01:18:16,125 --> 01:18:18,542
''Boy of 6, ''while parents sleep, drives off

736
01:18:18,708 --> 01:18:21,042
''in a pedal car.

737
01:18:21,375 --> 01:18:24,208
''Found on a highway in Germany,

738
01:18:24,375 --> 01:18:28,500
''he told the police
he wanted to see the stars.''

739
01:18:28,667 --> 01:18:30,333
Ain't life beautiful, though?

740
01:18:30,875 --> 01:18:36,167
Love. The only bug
she hadn't caught!

741
01:18:36,583 --> 01:18:39,667
- Nobody's immune.
- lt gives me a break.

742
01:18:39,833 --> 01:18:42,125
Love's a great beautician.

743
01:18:44,250 --> 01:18:48,542
What's she like?
Tall, small? Fair, dark?

744
01:18:48,708 --> 01:18:52,417
Let's say... average height.

745
01:18:53,292 --> 01:18:56,833
Not a dwarf or a giraffe. Normal.

746
01:18:57,708 --> 01:19:03,000
Pretty, for her type.
As for fair or dark, it's hard to say.

747
01:19:03,667 --> 01:19:08,250
She wasn't a redhead. Unless...

748
01:19:08,458 --> 01:19:09,833
Forget it.

749
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,792
l remember she casually asked
about your girlfriend.

750
01:19:13,917 --> 01:19:16,125
l said you weren't interested, right?

751
01:19:16,417 --> 01:19:18,750
And?

752
01:19:19,792 --> 01:19:21,208
You didn't!

753
01:19:21,375 --> 01:19:24,542
What do you care?
You don't even know her.

754
01:19:24,833 --> 01:19:28,750
- Exactly. lt's the mystery.
- You won't find mystery here.

755
01:19:29,083 --> 01:19:31,042
A pound of nectarines.

756
01:19:31,208 --> 01:19:34,375
These ones here
are the prettiest.

757
01:19:34,542 --> 01:19:37,458
Trust him. He's an artist!

758
01:19:37,583 --> 01:19:39,750
He goes home
with a ton of unsold stock.

759
01:19:39,875 --> 01:19:42,333
What for? ls he stewing a pig?

760
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:44,625
No sir! He's studying art!

761
01:19:44,750 --> 01:19:48,333
Sells leeks all day long
and paints turnips all night!

762
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:50,625
The boy's a useless vegetable!

763
01:19:50,750 --> 01:19:55,583
With a prompter in each cellar window
whispering comebacks,

764
01:19:55,708 --> 01:19:58,542
shy people
would have the last laugh.

765
01:19:58,708 --> 01:20:05,083
At least you'll never be a vegetable!
Even artichokes have hearts!

766
01:20:07,458 --> 01:20:11,583
You'll never be a vegetable.
Even artichokes have hearts!

767
01:21:11,458 --> 01:21:15,500
Darling Mado,
l miss you more and more each day.

768
01:21:15,875 --> 01:21:19,042
l'm an exile
in a world of dreary khaki.

769
01:21:19,292 --> 01:21:21,292
l can't sleep, can't eat...

770
01:21:21,542 --> 01:21:24,458
This camp was the mistake of my life,

771
01:21:24,583 --> 01:21:30,000
depriving me of my beloved
for five long weeks.

772
01:21:30,167 --> 01:21:32,125
l think of you endlessly.
Your Adrien.

773
01:21:32,625 --> 01:21:35,208
l turned down my last month's wages
instead of giving notice.

774
01:21:35,375 --> 01:21:38,000
l dream of better times ahead.

775
01:21:38,417 --> 01:21:45,833
An orange-colored day.
Remember, my love?

776
01:21:46,083 --> 01:21:48,833
Your everloving Adrien.

777
01:21:49,750 --> 01:21:52,375
Good news, sweetheart.

778
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:54,458
Soon l'll be able to afford a car

779
01:21:54,583 --> 01:21:57,000
and drive home every night.

780
01:21:57,125 --> 01:22:01,667
Till then, meet me on Friday
and we'll go out.

781
01:24:48,542 --> 01:24:50,583
MOTHER

782
01:24:53,583 --> 01:24:59,125
Psychiatric Helpline.

783
01:25:20,208 --> 01:25:21,583
WHERE & WHEN?

784
01:25:40,292 --> 01:25:45,000
One hour later,
on Boulevard St Martin,

785
01:25:45,125 --> 01:25:47,250
Amelie walks into
a party goods and costume shop.

786
01:25:47,667 --> 01:25:52,083
At the same time,
a man leaves his home on Rue Lecourbe.

787
01:25:54,042 --> 01:25:57,625
20 minutes later,
Amelie is at East Station.

788
01:26:01,958 --> 01:26:05,833
Simultaneously,
the man in red shoes parks outside.

789
01:26:05,958 --> 01:26:09,833
The time is exactly 11.40.

790
01:26:54,958 --> 01:26:57,417
At this precise moment, only Amelie has

791
01:26:57,542 --> 01:27:01,708
the key to the riddle
of the mystery man.

792
01:27:06,375 --> 01:27:08,167
How's it going, Mrs Wells?

793
01:27:08,292 --> 01:27:10,667
Not so bad when it's not raining.

794
01:27:11,250 --> 01:27:14,000
- This is for you.
- Me?

795
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:27,667
Dear Mrs Wells,
We recently recovered a mailbag

796
01:27:27,792 --> 01:27:30,125
that was lost in a plane crash

797
01:27:30,250 --> 01:27:33,083
on October 12th, 1969
on Mont Blanc.

798
01:27:33,208 --> 01:27:37,500
We are forwarding
the enclosed letter to your address

799
01:27:37,667 --> 01:27:41,333
with our apologies
for the uncustomary delay.

800
01:27:41,792 --> 01:27:45,125
Jacques Grosjean,
Customer Services.

801
01:27:46,042 --> 01:27:50,208
Darling Mado, l'm in exile.
l can't sleep, can't eat...

802
01:27:50,375 --> 01:27:51,667
l think of you endlessly.

803
01:27:51,833 --> 01:27:54,167
l know l've made
the mistake of my life.

804
01:27:54,292 --> 01:27:56,000
l turned down that woman's money.

805
01:27:56,125 --> 01:28:02,542
lf all goes well,
l'll soon be able to afford a house.

806
01:28:02,667 --> 01:28:06,750
l dream of better times ahead

807
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:10,625
when you'll forgive me
and join me here,

808
01:28:10,875 --> 01:28:15,292
one orange-colored day.
Your everloving Adrien.

809
01:28:43,667 --> 01:28:46,542
Another package for you.

810
01:28:55,583 --> 01:28:59,333
You heard about the concierge?

811
01:29:00,500 --> 01:29:01,625
She got a letter.

812
01:29:02,750 --> 01:29:06,500
From her husband. 40 years late!

813
01:29:08,083 --> 01:29:10,750
That's a lot, isn't it?

814
01:29:23,208 --> 01:29:26,625
l'm not big on still life,
Mr Dufayel.

815
01:29:26,875 --> 01:29:29,875
Then work on your lean layer.

816
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:33,000
Fat over lean. Always!

817
01:29:51,417 --> 01:29:52,333
Mr Dufayel?

818
01:29:52,458 --> 01:29:53,667
Yes?

819
01:29:53,958 --> 01:29:57,417
l heard there'll soon be a new star.

820
01:29:57,667 --> 01:30:00,667
You're into stars now?

821
01:30:00,917 --> 01:30:03,958
l saw it on TV at my ma's, that's why.

822
01:30:04,292 --> 01:30:08,375
l dunno if it's true.

823
01:30:09,833 --> 01:30:14,125
ln America,
they'll take rich people's ashes,

824
01:30:14,250 --> 01:30:17,000
put them in a satellite
and shoot it into space.

825
01:30:17,125 --> 01:30:21,542
lt's going to shine forever.

826
01:30:26,250 --> 01:30:28,292
And Lady Di...

827
01:30:28,458 --> 01:30:30,042
Will they do the same for her?

828
01:30:30,208 --> 01:30:33,417
Lady Di, Lady Di! Give it a rest!

829
01:30:33,625 --> 01:30:36,708
l can't concentrate! Lady Di!

830
01:30:41,833 --> 01:30:43,375
Renoir!

831
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:35,042
Run, Taly, run!

832
01:31:38,167 --> 01:31:40,667
Run, Taly, run!

833
01:31:47,708 --> 01:31:49,292
You're looking me?

834
01:31:49,458 --> 01:31:52,500
You're looking a man born hard look.

835
01:31:52,667 --> 01:31:58,125
l born in thirteen day
in Friday bad luck day

836
01:32:42,042 --> 01:32:45,250
l don't understand.

837
01:32:51,750 --> 01:32:54,167
Brilliant! You were perfect.

838
01:32:54,292 --> 01:32:55,500
Did it work?

839
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:57,417
lt's getting there.

840
01:32:57,542 --> 01:33:00,458
Ask me again anytime.
The harm's done.

841
01:33:00,583 --> 01:33:04,583
- Harm?
- Everybody calls me Snow White!

842
01:34:09,583 --> 01:34:12,333
The Two Windmills
from 4 PM.

843
01:34:18,833 --> 01:34:25,042
Could you stand in for me at 4?

844
01:34:25,167 --> 01:34:27,083
Again?

845
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,417
What's eating him?

846
01:34:37,542 --> 01:34:41,292
- l smile too much.
- He'd rather you frowned?

847
01:34:41,417 --> 01:34:43,667
With other men, yes.

848
01:34:46,667 --> 01:34:50,833
Nino is late.
Amelie can only see two explanations.

849
01:34:50,958 --> 01:34:53,833
1: He didn't get the photo.

850
01:34:54,542 --> 01:35:00,125
2: Before he could assemble it

851
01:35:00,250 --> 01:35:01,917
a gang of bank robbers
took him hostage.

852
01:35:02,042 --> 01:35:05,542
The cops gave chase.

853
01:35:05,667 --> 01:35:08,167
They got away but he caused a crash.

854
01:35:10,167 --> 01:35:13,125
When he came to,
he'd lost his memory.

855
01:35:14,167 --> 01:35:16,167
An ex-con picked him up,

856
01:35:16,292 --> 01:35:17,958
mistook him for a fugitive

857
01:35:18,083 --> 01:35:21,208
and shipped him to lstanbul.

858
01:35:21,500 --> 01:35:23,625
He met some Afghan raiders

859
01:35:23,750 --> 01:35:27,000
who took him to steal
some Russian warheads.

860
01:35:31,292 --> 01:35:34,958
But their truck hit a mine
in Tadzhikstan.

861
01:35:35,167 --> 01:35:37,167
He survived, took to the hills

862
01:35:37,292 --> 01:35:39,917
and became a Mujaheddin.

863
01:35:40,208 --> 01:35:41,667
Amelie refuses to get upset
for a guy

864
01:35:41,792 --> 01:35:47,750
who'll eat borscht all his life
in a hat like a tea cozy.

865
01:36:07,167 --> 01:36:09,583
- What can l get you?
- Coffee, please.

866
01:36:10,208 --> 01:36:11,792
Coffee.

867
01:36:34,125 --> 01:36:35,750
Your coffee.

868
01:36:37,083 --> 01:36:38,542
Thanks.

869
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:04,667
Today's menu

870
01:37:13,375 --> 01:37:18,375
He's understood.
He's going to put down his spoon,

871
01:37:19,833 --> 01:37:23,667
dip his finger in the sugar...

872
01:37:28,583 --> 01:37:32,792
turn around slowly and speak to me.

873
01:37:38,500 --> 01:37:44,375
ls this you?

874
01:37:49,292 --> 01:37:51,792
Yes, it's you.

875
01:37:54,625 --> 01:37:55,708
No.

876
01:38:12,542 --> 01:38:14,917
l clean it for you.

877
01:38:16,125 --> 01:38:19,708
- More coffee?
- No thanks.

878
01:38:40,708 --> 01:38:45,500
So it's this man here,
with his hand up?

879
01:38:45,792 --> 01:38:47,042
Yes.

880
01:38:49,417 --> 01:38:52,292
ls she in love with him?

881
01:38:54,708 --> 01:38:55,750
Yes.

882
01:38:57,792 --> 01:39:02,333
l think it's time
she took a real risk.

883
01:39:02,583 --> 01:39:06,625
She might.
She's devising a stratagem...

884
01:39:06,750 --> 01:39:10,375
She's fond of stratagems.

885
01:39:11,333 --> 01:39:13,958
Mmmm...yes.

886
01:39:14,292 --> 01:39:17,792
ln fact, she's cowardly.

887
01:39:17,917 --> 01:39:22,333
That's why l can't capture her look.

888
01:39:23,500 --> 01:39:28,833
Dufayel's attempts to meddle
are intolerable!

889
01:39:31,125 --> 01:39:35,292
lf Amelie chooses
to live in a dream

890
01:39:35,417 --> 01:39:41,417
and remain
an introverted young woman,

891
01:39:41,542 --> 01:39:46,750
she has an absolute right
to mess up her life!

892
01:40:20,583 --> 01:40:23,292
What are you doing?

893
01:40:24,667 --> 01:40:32,875
Tell me, Lucien. For deliveries,
do you keep keys to all the apartments?

894
01:40:44,333 --> 01:40:48,375
One of your booths is out of order.

895
01:40:50,708 --> 01:40:53,792
lt seems to be jammed.

896
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,375
East Station ticket hall.

897
01:40:59,625 --> 01:41:00,667
Buy a video, get one free?

898
01:41:00,833 --> 01:41:02,417
l don't want to buy.

899
01:41:08,833 --> 01:41:12,458
Samantha?

900
01:41:21,875 --> 01:41:25,292
Can you stand in for me at...

901
01:41:46,583 --> 01:41:51,625
Photo booth, East Station,
Tuesday 5 PM.

902
01:43:03,750 --> 01:43:06,167
Almost done.

903
01:43:10,125 --> 01:43:15,000
The mystery man wasn't a ghost
or a man scared of aging,

904
01:43:15,167 --> 01:43:16,458
but simply the repairman,

905
01:43:16,583 --> 01:43:19,208
a normal guy doing his job.

906
01:44:08,125 --> 01:44:12,625
He keeps spying on me!
lt's making me sick.

907
01:44:12,750 --> 01:44:16,000
4:15 Blatant female conspiracy.

908
01:44:16,625 --> 01:44:22,250
Gosh, you're tense!
Good luck. You'll need it.

909
01:44:30,500 --> 01:44:32,042
Excuse me.
Did you put this in my pocket?

910
01:44:32,167 --> 01:44:35,500
- Yes, but l'm not the one...
- l know. Where is she?

911
01:44:35,667 --> 01:44:41,042
At her father's.
lt bothers me... Can l talk to you?

912
01:44:41,167 --> 01:44:44,000
l get off at six. Can you come back?

913
01:44:44,167 --> 01:44:47,667
Okay.
See you then.

914
01:44:48,208 --> 01:44:51,042
4.08: Docking scheduled.

915
01:45:22,333 --> 01:45:27,208
A blond guy in a camel coat.
Absent-minded, too.

916
01:45:27,458 --> 01:45:29,167
How come?

917
01:45:29,667 --> 01:45:32,417
He came back 3 times the same day.

918
01:45:33,458 --> 01:45:36,708
1.12: Camel coat.

919
01:45:36,833 --> 01:45:38,958
2.50: Camel coat.

920
01:45:39,250 --> 01:45:42,292
- 4.17...
- Stop it!

921
01:45:42,458 --> 01:45:44,667
My rash has come back!

922
01:45:44,792 --> 01:45:48,167
Look, Suzanne! My rash is back.

923
01:45:48,333 --> 01:45:50,083
He's driving me nuts!

924
01:45:50,208 --> 01:45:52,333
Lay off!

925
01:45:52,583 --> 01:45:55,167
Her conscience is at fault.

926
01:45:55,333 --> 01:45:58,500
l've had it! l'm going home.

927
01:45:58,833 --> 01:46:01,833
Psychos are the last straw!

928
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:03,917
Georgette!

929
01:46:05,958 --> 01:46:09,667
Stop smothering them!
Women need air.

930
01:46:09,833 --> 01:46:12,792
You give them air, they blow you off.

931
01:46:12,958 --> 01:46:14,625
Fresh air's healthy.

932
01:46:14,750 --> 01:46:17,583
Cram it, failure!

933
01:46:17,708 --> 01:46:21,500
Failed writer, failed life...

934
01:46:21,667 --> 01:46:23,375
l love the word ''fail''.

935
01:46:23,500 --> 01:46:25,333
Failure is human destiny.

936
01:46:25,500 --> 01:46:27,292
lt's gasbag time!

937
01:46:27,417 --> 01:46:31,750
Failure teaches us
that life is but a draft,

938
01:46:31,875 --> 01:46:35,833
a long rehearsal
for a show that will never play.

939
01:46:36,083 --> 01:46:39,125
l bet he stole that!

940
01:46:39,458 --> 01:46:41,000
l do have some original ideas,

941
01:46:41,333 --> 01:46:43,208
but people always steal them.

942
01:46:44,500 --> 01:46:46,375
Same as your women.

943
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:48,458
Meaning?

944
01:46:49,125 --> 01:46:51,875
You'd better get used to it.

945
01:46:52,167 --> 01:46:55,208
Speak for yourself, you...

946
01:46:55,333 --> 01:47:00,000
- What's going on?
- Nothing much.

947
01:47:00,167 --> 01:47:03,917
Georgette went out. Joseph got mad.

948
01:47:04,042 --> 01:47:05,375
''Went out?''

949
01:47:05,500 --> 01:47:08,958
Like Gina. You know who Gina's with?

950
01:47:09,125 --> 01:47:12,333
The guy with the plastic bag!

951
01:47:12,625 --> 01:47:14,792
l saw their little game.

952
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:16,292
The note in the coat pocket,

953
01:47:16,417 --> 01:47:17,708
4.20.

954
01:47:17,833 --> 01:47:22,708
Back he comes, and hey presto!
Out they go.

955
01:47:26,708 --> 01:47:29,750
l'm worried for Amelie
because l like you.

956
01:47:29,875 --> 01:47:30,750
What do you mean?

957
01:47:31,292 --> 01:47:34,958
By and large,
the men l like are mentally unsound.

958
01:47:35,292 --> 01:47:38,333
- l'd like to know more about you.
- Ask me.

959
01:47:38,500 --> 01:47:43,000
One swallow doesn't make?

960
01:47:43,750 --> 01:47:45,250
A swallow?

961
01:47:46,458 --> 01:47:47,958
A summer.

962
01:47:48,125 --> 01:47:49,333
Practice makes...

963
01:47:49,500 --> 01:47:50,875
Perfect.

964
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:52,708
- Curiosity...
- Killed the cat.

965
01:47:52,833 --> 01:47:54,000
- Haste...
- Makes waste.

966
01:47:54,167 --> 01:47:55,625
- Rolling stone...
- Gathers no moss.

967
01:47:55,792 --> 01:47:58,000
- lt's a sin...
- To steal a pin.

968
01:47:58,167 --> 01:48:01,958
- Absence makes?
- The heart grow fonder.

969
01:48:02,083 --> 01:48:04,125
- Not bad.
- You collect them?

970
01:48:04,250 --> 01:48:08,917
At home, we say a man
who knows proverbs can't be all bad.

971
01:48:12,750 --> 01:48:15,125
Pretty girl from the 5th floor,
listen to this!

972
01:48:15,250 --> 01:48:19,667
- You believe in miracles?
- Not today.

973
01:48:20,583 --> 01:48:22,292
You're in for a surprise.

974
01:48:22,417 --> 01:48:25,333
What if l told you that
a team of climbers on Mont Blanc

975
01:48:25,458 --> 01:48:30,750
had found hard proof that
my husband loved me?

976
01:49:07,875 --> 01:49:10,167
Lucien, l need some yeast.

977
01:49:10,333 --> 01:49:14,208
For Miss Amelie?
She's baking her famous plumcake?

978
01:49:14,333 --> 01:49:17,458
Lucien, go to get some yeast.

979
01:50:11,250 --> 01:50:15,000
Amelie! Amelie!

980
01:50:21,292 --> 01:50:22,958
Amelie!

981
01:50:43,625 --> 01:50:47,000
l'll be back

982
01:51:16,333 --> 01:51:19,458
Go into the bedroom, Miss Poulain.

983
01:51:35,333 --> 01:51:39,583
So, little Amelie.

984
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,625
Your bones aren't made of glass.

985
01:51:42,750 --> 01:51:45,958
You can take life's knocks.

986
01:51:46,167 --> 01:51:49,833
lf you let this chance go by,

987
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:54,875
eventually, your heart will become

988
01:51:55,000 --> 01:52:00,333
as dry and brittle as my skeleton.

989
01:52:00,667 --> 01:52:09,458
So... Go get him, for Pete's sake!

990
01:54:57,167 --> 01:55:02,208

At the funfair,
near the Ghost Train,

01:56:05,792 --> 01:56:09,958
the marshmallow twister is twisting,

995
01:56:10,083 --> 01:56:13,958
while in Villette Park,

996
01:56:14,083 --> 01:56:15,542
Felix Lerbier learns

997
01:56:15,667 --> 01:56:20,500
there are more links in
his brain than atoms in the universe.

998
01:56:21,083 --> 01:56:25,792
