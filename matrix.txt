片名：駭客任務
「啟動通話」
一切就緒了嗎？
今天不是輪到你值班
- Is everything in place?
- You weren 't supposed to relieve me.
我知道，我只是想接班
I know, but I felt like taking a shift.
你喜歡他，對吧？喜歡看著他
You like him, don 't you?
You like watching him.
別傻了
我們會害死他，你知道嗎？
- Don 't be ridiculous.
- We're gonna kill him. You understand?
莫斐斯相信他是救世主
Morpheus believes he is the One.
你信嗎？
Do you?
那並不重要
It doesn 't matter what I believe.
你不信，對吧？
You don 't, do you?
聽到了嗎？
什麼？
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?
你確定沒被竊聽？
Are you sure this line is clean?
我很確定
Yeah, of course I'm sure.
我得走了
I better go.
別動，警察
手舉起來
- Freeze! Police!
- Hands on your head!
快點，舉起來
Do it! Do it now!
「市中心旅館」
警官
Lieutenant.
可惡
Oh, shit.
警官，我給你的指令很明確
Lieutenant, you were given
specific orders.
我只是公事公辦
I'm just doing my job.
要是你給我擺臭架子
你就去死吧
You give me that "juris-my-dick-tion"
crap, you can cram it up your ass.
我是為了你們的安全
The orders were for your protection.
我們對付得了一個女人
I think we can handle one little girl.
我派了兩組警員
I sent two units!
他們就要逮到她了
They're bringing her down now!
才怪，警官，他們早就死了
No, Lieutenant, your men
are already dead.
可惡
Shit.
莫斐斯，我的行蹤暴露了
Morpheus, the line was traced.
I don't know how.
我知道，電話線被切斷
I know. They cut the hard line.
來不及了，你得找別的出口
There's no time.
Get to another exit.
附近有幹員嗎？
Are there any agents?
有
Yes.
該死
Goddamn it.
崔妮蒂，你得專心
You have to focus, Trinity.
威斯和雷克街口有電話
There's a phone at Wells and Lake.
你趕得到
You can make it.
好
去吧
- All right.
- Go.
不可能
That's impossible.
起來，崔妮蒂
快起來
Get up, Trinity.
Just get up.
起來
Get up.
她逃走了
She got out.
無所謂
It doesn't matter.
線人沒說錯
對
The informant is real.
我們知道下一個目標
We have the name of their next target.
名字是尼歐
The name is Neo.
必須進行搜尋
We'll need a search running.
已經開始了
It has already begun.
「搜尋中…」
「莫斐斯逃脫警方圍捕」
「展開追捕行動」
「醒醒，尼歐…」
什麼？
What?
「母體奴役著你…」
搞什麼？
What the hell?
「跟隨小白兔」
跟隨小白兔？
"Follow the white rabbit."
「有人敲門，尼歐」
什麼人？
Who is it?
是喬伊
It's Choi.
你遲到了兩小時
You're two hours late.
我知道，都是她的錯
I know. It's her fault.
錢呢？
You got the money?
兩千元
Two grand.
等等
Hold on.
哈利路亞
Hallelujah.
你是救世主，老兄
你是我的救星
You're my savior.
My own personal Jesus Christ.
要是你被逮到
You get caught using that...
我知道，不能把你抖出來
I know. This never happened.
You don't exist.
對
- Right.
- Something wrong, man?
怎麼了？你的臉色很蒼白
You look a little whiter than usual.
我的電腦
My computer, it...
你會不會覺得…
自己在半夢半醒之間？
Ever have that feeling where you're
not sure if you're awake or dreaming?
每次嗑了藥就有這種感覺
All the time.
It's called mescaline.
讓你騰雲駕霧
It's the only way to fly.
聽起來你得發洩發洩
It just sounds like you
need to unplug.
休息一下吧
Get some R and R?
怎麼樣？帶他去好嗎？
What do you think, Dujour?
Should we take him with us?
當然好
Definitely.
不行，明天我得上班
No, I can't. I have work tomorrow.
來吧
Come on.
一定會很好玩，我保證
It'll be fun. I promise.
好，我去
Yeah.
Sure. I'll go.
你好，尼歐
Hello, Neo.
你知道我名字？
How do you know that name?
我知道的很多
I know a lot about you.
你是誰？
Who are you?
我叫崔妮蒂
My name is Trinity.
崔妮蒂
Trinity.
不就是侵入國稅局的電腦駭客
The Trinity?
That cracked the IRS D-base?
那是很久以前
That was a long time ago.
天啊
Jesus.
怎麼了？
What?
我以為…
I just thought...
你是男的
...you were a guy.
男人都這麼想
Most guys do.
你侵入我的電腦
That was you on my computer.
怎麼辦到的？
How did you do that?
現在我只能告訴你
Right now, all I can tell you...
你有危險
...is that you're in danger.
我是來警告你
什麼危險？
- I brought you here to warn you.
- Of what?
他們在監視你，尼歐
They're watching you, Neo.
誰？
Who is?
聽我說
Please just listen.
我知道你來的目的
I know why you're here, Neo.
還有你在做什麼
I know what you've been doing.
我知道你輾轉難眠
I know why you hardly sleep...
每天晚上都獨自一個人
...why you live alone and why,
night after night...
坐在電腦前工作
...you sit at your computer.
你在找他
You're looking for him.
我也曾找過同一個人
I know, because I was once
looking for the same thing.
當他找到我
And when he found me...
他說其實我不是在找他
...he told me I wasn't really
looking for him...
而是尋找一個答案
...I was looking for an answer.
有個問題驅使著我們，尼歐
It's the question that drives us, Neo.
這問題把你帶來這裡
It's the question
that brought you here.
你我都知道這個問題
You know the question...
...just as I did.
母體是什麼？
What is the Matrix?
世上一定有答案，尼歐
The answer is out there, Neo.
它在尋找你
It's looking for you.
只要你願意，它就會找到你
And it will find you...
...if you want it to.
該死
Shit.
該死…該死…
Shit, shit.
安德森先生，你很叛逆
You have a problem with authority,
Mr. Anderson.
你自以為很特別
可以不遵守公司的規定
You believe that you are special,
that the rules do not apply to you.
很顯然，你錯了
Obviously, you are mistaken.
這是世界頂尖的軟體公司
This is one of the top
software companies in the world...
每個員工都是小螺絲釘
...because employees understand
they are part of a whole.
只要一個員工出錯
公司就會出毛病
Thus, if an employee has a problem,
the company has a problem.
你現在有兩個選擇
安德森先生
The time has come to make
a choice, Mr. Anderson.
從今天起準時到公司上班
Either you choose to be at your desk
on time from this day forth...
或是另謀高就
...or you choose to find another job.
你明白嗎？
Do I make myself clear?
是的，我完全明白
Yes, Mr. Rhineheart.
Perfectly clear.
湯瑪斯安德森嗎？
Thomas Anderson?
我就是
Yeah, that's me.
太好了
Great.
祝你愉快
Have a nice day.
尼歐，你知道我是誰嗎？
Hello, Neo. Do you know who this is?
莫斐斯
- Morpheus.
- Yes.
是的，我一直在找你
I've been looking for you.
我不知道你準備好了沒有
I don 't know if you're ready to see
what I want to show you.
不過我們恐怕沒時間了
But unfortunately, you and I
have run out of time.
他們來抓你
尼歐，後果不堪設想
They're coming for you, and I don 't know
what they're going to do.
誰來抓我？
Who's coming for me?
站起來自己看
Stand up and see for yourself.
什麼？現在嗎？
What? Right now?
對
Yes.
現在
Now.
慢慢站起來
Do it slowly.
電梯那邊
The elevator.
糟糕
Oh, shit!
他們抓我幹嘛？
What do they want?
不知道，如果不想被逮
我建議你快逃
I don 't know. If you don 't want
to find out, get out of there.
怎麼逃？
How?
我教你，不過你得聽話
I can guide you,
but you must do exactly as I say.
好
對面是空的
The cubicle across from you is empty.
要是他們…
快去
- But what if they...
- Go. Now.
先待在這裡躲一下
Stay here for just a moment.
等我下令就走出去
When I tell you,
go to the end of the row...
到走廊盡頭的辦公室
...to the office
at the end of the hall.
盡量趴低點
Stay as low as you can.
去吧
Go. Now.
很好，現在外面有個洗窗架
Good. Now, outside
there is a scaffold.
你是怎麼知道的？
來不及了，尼歐
- How do you know this?
- We don 't have time.
左手邊有窗戶，快點
To your left there's a window.
Go to it.
打開
Open it.
用洗窗架上到屋頂
Take the scaffold to the roof.
不行，太瘋狂了
No way! No way!
This is crazy!
只有兩個方法能出去
There are two ways
out of this building.
爬上洗窗架或是被他們帶走
One is that scaffold.
The other is in their custody.
都很危險，你自己決定
You take a chance either way.
I leave it to you.
太瘋狂了
This is insane!
怎麼會有這種事？
Why is this happening to me?
我幹了什麼？
What'd I do?
我是小人物，什麼也沒幹
I'm nobody.
I didn't do anything.
我死定了
I'm gonna die.
該死…
Shit!
該死…
Oh, shit!
我辦不到
I can't do this.
可惡
Shit.
如你所見
我們已經注意你很久了
As you can see, we've had our eye
on you for some time now, Mr. Anderson.
看來你一直有…
It seems that you've been living...
兩種身份
...two lives.
其中一個是湯瑪斯安德森
In one life,
you're Thomas A. Anderson...
軟體公司的程式工程師
...program writer for
a respectable software company.
你有社會安全號碼，也納稅
You have a social security number.
You pay your taxes.
還有…
And you...
你會幫房東太太倒垃圾
...help your landlady
carry out her garbage.
另一個你活在電腦中
The other life is lived in computers...
使用的駭客代號是尼歐
...where you go by
the hacker alias "Neo"...
幾乎犯下每項電腦犯罪
...and are guilty of virtually every
computer crime we have a law for.
你其中一個身份
One of these lives...
有前瞻性的未來
...has a future.
另一個則沒有
And one of them does not.
我就直話直說吧，安德森
I'm going to be as forthcoming
as I can be, Mr. Anderson.
找你來，是因為…
You're here...
我們需要你的協助
...because we need your help.
我們知道你常常聯絡…
We know that you've been contacted
by a certain...
某個人
...individual.
這個人稱呼他自己為莫斐斯
A man who calls himself "Morpheus."
你對他瞭解多少都不重要
Whatever you think you know
about this man is irrelevant.
警方都把他視為…
He is considered by many authorities...
世上最危險的人物
...to be the most dangerous man alive.
我的同事
My colleagues...
認為我是在浪費時間
...believe that I am wasting
my time with you.
不過我相信你想改過自新
But I believe you wish
to do the right thing.
我們願意刪除你的不良紀錄
We're willing to wipe the slate clean...
讓你重新做人
...give you a fresh start.
你只要跟我們合作
All we're asking in return
is your cooperation...
把這名恐怖份子繩之以法
...in bringing
a known terrorist to justice.
是啊
Yeah.
這條件聽起來很棒
That sounds like a really good deal.
但我有更棒的想法
But I got a better one.
這樣吧
How about...
我向你伸中指
...I give you the finger...
你就讓我打電話
...and you give me my phone call.
安德森先生
Mr. Anderson...
你讓我很失望
...you disappoint me.
你這樣是嚇不倒我的
You can't scare me
with this gestapo crap.
我有權利，我要打電話
I know my rights.
I want my phone call.
請你告訴我，安德森
Tell me, Mr. Anderson...
開不了口
...what good is a phone call...
打電話有什麼用？
...if you're unable to speak?
你一定要幫我們
You're going to help us,
Mr. Anderson...
不管你要或不要
...whether you want to...
...or not.
電話被監控，我長話短說
This line is tapped,
so I must be brief.
他們逮到你卻低估你的重要性
They got to you first, but they've
underestimated how important you are.
要是他們知道
If they knew what I know...
你或許早就沒命了
...you would probably be dead.
你在說什麼？我是…
什麼人？
What are you talking about?
What is happening to me?
你是救世主，尼歐
這幾年來你在找我
You are the One, Neo. You may have
spent the last few years...
但是我這輩子都在找你
...looking for me, but I've spent
my entire life...
...looking for you.
現在，你還想見我嗎？
Now, do you still want to meet?
想
那就到亞當街橋
- Yes.
- Then go to the Adams Street bridge.
上車
Get in.
這是幹嘛？
What's this?
這是為了保護我們的安全
It's necessary, Neo.
For our protection.
你們怕誰？
From what?
怕你
From you.
脫掉上衣
Take off your shirt.
什麼
停車
Stop the car.
給我聽好，你最好廢話少說
Listen, coppertop.
We don't have time for 20 Questions.
現在，你只有兩個選擇
Right now, there's only one rule:
不聽我們的
Our way...
就滾下車
...or the highway.
好吧
Fine.
拜託，尼歐
請你相信我
Please, Neo, you have to trust me.
為什麼？
因為你活在這虛擬世界
- Why?
- Because you have been down there.
對它很清楚
You know that road.
只有一個後果
You know exactly where it ends.
那不是你想要的
And I know that's
not where you want to be.
開燈
Apoc, lights.
躺下來，掀開上衣
Lie back.
Lift up your shirt.
那是什麼？
What's that?
你肚子裡有蟲
You're bugged.
試著放輕鬆
Try and relax.
現身吧
Come on.
快點
Come on.
它在動
It's on the move.
可惡
Come on, you shit.
你抓不到它
才怪
- You're gonna lose it.
- No, I'm not.
讓開
Clear!
天啊，那玩意是真的
Jesus Christ!
That thing's real?!
我們到了
This is it.
我給你一個建議
Let me give you one piece of advice.
老實點
Be honest.
他幾乎無所不知
He knows more than you can imagine.
我們終於見面
At last.
尼歐，歡迎
Welcome, Neo.
你一定猜到
As you no doubt have guessed...
我就是莫斐斯
...I am Morpheus.
見到你是我的榮幸
It's an honor to meet you.
不
No...
這是我的榮幸
...the honor is mine.
請…
過來坐
Please, come. Sit.
我猜…
I imagine...
你現在一定覺得
有點像愛麗絲…
...that right now you're feeling
a bit like Alice...
…夢遊到了仙境
...tumbling down the rabbit hole?
有點像
You could say that.
從你的眼神，我看得出來
I can see it in your eyes.
你對這一切逆來順受
You have the look of a man
who accepts what he sees...
你想從夢中驚醒
...because he's expecting to wake up.
老實說，你會醒過來
Ironically, this is not
far from the truth.
尼歐，你相信命運嗎？
Do you believe in fate, Neo?
不信
No.
為什麼？
Why not?
我相信我能掌控自己的生命
I don't like the idea that
I'm not in control of my life.
我瞭解你所說的意思
I know exactly what you mean.
讓我告訴你來的原因
Let me tell you why you're here.
你知道有些事
You know something.
雖然你無法解釋
What you know,
you can't explain.
卻能感覺到
But you feel it.
你這一生都感覺到
You felt it your entire life.
這世界很不對勁
你說不出個所以然來
Something's wrong with the world.
You don't know what, but it's there.
就像心頭有根刺
Like a splinter in your mind...
會把你逼瘋
...driving you mad.
所以你才會找上我
It is this feeling
that has brought you to me.
你知道是什麼嗎？
Do you know what
I'm talking about?
母體嗎？
The Matrix?
你想知道…
Do you want to know...
它是什麼嗎？
...what it is?
母體無所不在、隨處可見
The Matrix is everywhere.
It is all around us.
它甚至在這房間
Even now, in this very room.
你從窗戶外可以看到它
You can see it when you
look out your window...
或在電視上也會看到它
...or when you turn on your television.
上班時感覺它的存在
You can feel it when you go to work...
當你上教堂…
...when you go to church...
…或納稅時也一樣
...when you pay your taxes.
它是虛擬世界
It is the world that has been
pulled over your eyes...
在你眼前製造假象蒙蔽真相
...to blind you from the truth.
什麼真相？
What truth?
你是個奴隸
That you are a slave.
每個人呱呱落地後
Like everyone else,
you were born into bondage...
就活在一個沒有知覺的牢獄
...born into a prison that you cannot
smell or taste or touch.
一個心靈的牢籠
A prison...
...for your mind.
很不幸，我無法告訴你
Unfortunately, no one can be...
母體到底是什麼？
...told what the Matrix is.
你必須親眼目睹
You have to see it for yourself.
這是你最後一次機會
This is your last chance.
決定了就不能反悔
After this, there is no turning back.
吞下藍色藥丸
You take the blue pill...
幻境結束，起床後
...the story ends, you wake up
in your bed and believe...
...whatever you want to believe.
吞下紅色藥丸
You take the red pill...
而我就帶你去見識見識
...you stay in Wonderland...
...and I show you how deep
the rabbit hole goes.
記住
Remember...
我只能告訴你真相
...all I'm offering is the truth.
Nothing more.
跟我來
Follow me.
艾巴，上線了嗎？
Apoc, are we on-line?
快了
Almost.
時間老是不夠
Time is always against us.
請坐下來
Please take a seat there.
你也這麼做過？
You did all this?
藥丸裡有追蹤程式
The pill you took is
part of a trace program.
用來追蹤你身體所在的位置
It disrupts your carrier signals
so we can pinpoint your location.
什麼意思？
What does that mean?
繫好安全帶，菜鳥
It means buckle your
seat belt, Dorothy...
跟老家說再見吧
...because Kansas...
...is going bye-bye.
你們…？
Did you...?
你曾做過一種夢
彷彿實實在在的發生過？
Have you ever had a dream, Neo,
that you were so sure was real?
要是你醒不過來呢？
What if you were unable
to wake from that dream?
你該怎麼分辨夢世界…
How would you know the difference
between the dream world...
和真實世界？
...and the real world?
不可能
This can't be.
什麼？
Be what?
不可能是真的？
Be real?
開始複製程序
Going into replication.
找不到
Still nothing.
好冷
It's cold.
好冷
It's cold!
坦克，趕快找到訊號
Tank, we'll need a signal soon.
心臟衰竭
I got a fibrillation.
艾巴，快找到位置
Apoc, location.
就快找到了
Targeting almost there.
他的心跳停止
He's going into arrest.
找到了
Lock. I got him!
Now, Tank, now!
歡迎來到真實世界
Welcome...
...to the real world.
我們成功了，崔妮蒂
We've done it, Trinity.
我們找到他了
We found him.
希望你沒錯
不用懷疑
- I hope you're right.
- I don't have to hope.
我很確定
I know it.
我死了嗎？
Am I dead?
正好相反
Far from it.
他需要很多復健
He still needs a lot of work.
你在做什麼？
What are you doing?
你的肌肉萎縮，得重新鍛練
Your muscles atrophied.
We're rebuilding them.
我的眼睛好痛
Why do my eyes hurt?
你從來都沒用過
You've never used them before.
休息吧，尼歐
Rest, Neo.
你會知道答案的
The answers are coming.
莫斐斯，我發生什麼事？
Morpheus, what's happened to me?
這是哪裡？
What is this place?
更重要的是這是幾時
More important than "what" is "when."
幾時？
When?
你以為是 1999 年
You believe it's the year 1999...
其實是 2199 年左右
...when in fact, it's closer to 2199.
我無法告訴你確定的年份
I can't tell you exactly
what year it is...
因為我不知道
...because we honestly don't know.
我怎麼說你都不會懂，尼歐
There's nothing I can say
that will explain it for you.
跟我來，你自己看吧
Come with me.
See for yourself.
這是我的船
This is my ship.
尼布加尼撒號，是艘氣墊船
The Nebuchadnezzar.
It's a hovercraft.
這是主艙
This is the main deck.
核心地帶
This is the core...
「 2060 年製造」
我們非法向母體傳播訊號
...where we broadcast our pirate signal
and hack into the Matrix.
這些人你都認識
Most of my crew you already know.
這是艾巴
This is Apoc...
蘇薇琪
...Switch...
塞佛
...and Cypher.
你不認識的是
坦克和他大哥道瑟
The ones you don't know:
Tank and his big brother, Dozer.
在你後面的是茂史
The little one behind you is Mouse.
你想知道母體是什麼嗎？
You wanted to know
what the Matrix is?
崔妮蒂
Trinity.
放輕鬆
Try to relax.
你會覺得有點怪
This will feel a little weird.
「輔助磁碟機」
這裡
This...
是主架構
...is the Construct.
資料載入程式
It's our loading program.
應有盡有
We can load anything, from clothing...
包括有衣服…器材…
...to equipment...
武器…
...weapons...
模擬訓練
...training simulations...
要什麼有什麼
...anything we need.
我們已在電腦程式中？
Right now we're inside
a computer program?
這麼難以置信嗎？
Is it really so hard to believe?
你的穿著不同，插孔不見了
Your clothes are different.
The plugs in your body are gone.
髮型也不一樣
Your hair has changed.
這是所謂的「殘留自我影像」
Your appearance now is what we call
"residual self-image."
你在虛擬世界的投影
It is the mental projection
of your digital self.
這都不是真的？
This isn't real?
什麼是真實？
What is "real"?
真實該怎麼定義？
How do you define "real"?
如果你指的是觸覺…
If you're talking about
what you can feel...
嗅覺、味覺和視覺
...what you can smell, taste and see...
那全是大腦接收的電子訊號
...then "real" is simply electrical
signals interpreted by your brain.
這是你熟悉的世界
This is the world that you know.
就是二十世紀末的世界
The world as it was at the end
of the 20th century.
其實這是互動的虛擬世界
It exists now only as part of
a neural-interactive simulation...
我們所謂的母體
...that we call the Matrix.
你一直活在夢世界，尼歐
You've been living
in a dream world, Neo.
這才是真實的世界
This is the world...
...as it exists today.
歡迎來到…
Welcome to "the desert...
真實世界
...of the real."
我們只有殘缺的資料
We have only bits and pieces
of information.
不過我們知道在 21 世紀初
But what we know for certain
is that in the early 21 st century...
全人類都歡欣鼓舞
慶祝我們偉大的成就
...all of mankind was united
in celebration.
ＡＩ 終於研發成功
We marveled at our own magnificence
as we gave birth to Al.
���ɣ�
Al.
你是說人工智慧
You mean artificial intelligence.
這個人工智慧繁衍出電腦人
A singular consciousness that spawned
an entire race of machines.
誰先攻擊誰已經不可考
We don't know who struck first,
us or them.
不過人類卻遮蔽了天空
But we know that it was us
that scorched the sky.
當時電腦人只能依靠太陽能
They were dependent on solar power...
人類以為電腦人只要…
...and it was believed that
they would be unable to survive...
失去太陽的能量就會滅亡
...without an energy source
as abundant as the sun.
在近代的歷史
人類一直仰賴電腦生存
Throughout human history, we have been
dependent on machines to survive.
命運，它似乎充滿了反諷
Fate, it seems, is not
without a sense of irony.
電腦人身體發出的生化電力
超過 120 伏特
The human body generates more
bioelectricity than a 120-volt battery.
產生 25000 熱量單位
And over 25,000 BTUs of body heat.
只要經過核熔合
Combined with a form of fusion...
電腦人就有用之不盡的能量
...the machines had found all the energy
they would ever need.
它們開發出一望無際的場地
There are fields, Neo,
endless fields...
人類不再從娘胎出生
...where human beings
are no longer born.
而是被栽培出來
We are grown.
我一直不肯相信
For the longest time,
I wouldn't believe it.
直到我親眼看見它們…
And then I saw the fields
with my own eyes...
將死人融化
...watched them liquefy the dead...
融化的液體用來餵食新生兒
...so they could be fed intravenously
to the living.
我眼睜睜看著它們規律的運作
And standing there,
facing the pure, horrifying precision...
終於知道殘酷的真相
...I came to realize
the obviousness of the truth.
母體是什麼？
What is the Matrix?
一種控制方法
Control.
母體是電腦模擬的夢世界
The Matrix is a computer-generated
dream world...
為了控制所有的人類
...built to keep us under control...
把我們從人…
...in order to change a human being...
變成這玩意
...into this.
不
No.
我不相信
I don't believe it.
不可能
It's not possible.
我沒說這很容易相信，尼歐
我只說這是真相
I didn't say it would be easy, Neo.
I just said it would be the truth.
別說了
Stop!
讓我出去
Let me out!
放開我，我要出去
Let me out! I want out!
尼歐，冷靜點
把這玩意弄掉
- Easy, Neo. Easy.
- Get this thing out of me.
把這玩意弄掉
Get this thing out of me!
別碰我，走開
Don't touch me!
離我遠一點
Stay away from me!
我不信
I don't believe it.
我不相信你
I don't believe it.
我不信
I don't believe it.
他會發瘋
- He's gonna pop.
- Breathe, Neo.
深呼吸，尼歐
Just breathe.
我回不去了，對吧？
I can't go back, can I?
沒錯
No.
要是你能
But if you could...
你真想回去嗎？
...would you really want to?
我向你道歉
I owe you an apology.
我們有個規矩
We have a rule.
絕對不能解放成人的心靈
We never free a mind
once it's reached a certain age.
非常危險
It's dangerous.
會無法接受真相
The mind has trouble letting go.
我見過，很抱歉這麼說
I've seen it before, and I'm sorry.
我這麼做是因為…
I did what I did because...
別無選擇
...I had to.
當母體成形時
有一個人在裡面出生
When the Matrix was first built,
there was a man born inside...
他有能力隨意改變母體
...who had the ability
to change whatever he wanted...
重新創造真實世界
...to remake the Matrix as he saw fit.
他解放了第一批反抗份子
It was he who freed the first of us...
告訴我們真相
...taught us the truth.
只要母體存在一天
As long as the Matrix exists...
人類就沒有自由
...the human race will never be free.
他死後
After he died...
祭師預言他將再度降臨
...the Oracle prophesied his return...
他將帶來母體的毀滅
...and that his coming would hail
the destruction of the Matrix...
戰爭的終結
...end the war...
和全人類的自由
...bring freedom to our people.
所以我們終其一生遊走母體中
That is why there are those of us who
spent our lives searching the Matrix...
尋找救世主
...Iooking for him.
我這麼做是因為…
I did what I did because...
我相信我找到了
...I believe that search is over.
好好休息，你需要體力
Get some rest.
You're going to need it.
做什麼？
For what?
接受訓練
Your training.
早，睡得好嗎？
Morning. Did you sleep?
我保證你今晚一定睡得好
You will tonight.
I guarantee it.
我是坦克，你的總機
I'm Tank. I'll be your operator.
你身上沒有…
插孔？沒有
- You don't have any...
- Holes? Nope.
我和我老哥道瑟
我們是百分之百的純種人類
Me and my brother, Dozer, are 100?o pure,
old-fashioned, homegrown human.
在真實世界出生的
Born free right here...
錫安之子
...in the real world.
Genuine child of Zion.
錫安？
- Zion?
- Lf the war was over tomorrow...
要是戰爭結束，錫安就熱鬧了
...Zion's where the party would be.
那是個城市？
It's a city?
碩果僅存的人類城市
The last human city.
The only place we have left.
在哪裡？
Where is it?
在地底，靠近溫熱的地心
Deep underground...
...near the Earth's core,
where it's still warm.
你活得夠久就能看到
You live long enough,
you might see it.
老實說，要是莫斐斯說得沒錯
Goddamn! I gotta tell you, I'm excited
to see what you're capable of...
我很想見識你的本事
...if Morpheus is right and all.
我們不該談這檔事
We're not supposed to
talk about this, but...
不過如果你是…
...if you are...
真令人興奮
...it's a very exciting time.
今天會很忙，我們快開始吧
We got a lot to do.
We gotta get to it.
本來要從這些程式先開始
We're supposed to start
with these programs first.
不過太無聊了
That's major boring shit.
Let's do something more fun.
先來點好玩的
How about...
搏擊訓練
...combat training?
柔道？
"Jujitsu"?
我要學柔道？
I'm going to learn jujitsu?
我的天
Holy shit!
乖乖，他很喜歡
"Hey, Mikey, I think he likes it."
再來嗎？
How about some more?
好呀
Hell, yes.
太棒了
Hell, yeah.
「少林拳」
「跆拳道」
「醉拳」
怎麼樣？
How is he?
Ten hours straight.
He's a machine.
我學會功夫了
I know kung fu.
練給我看
Show me.
這是搏擊程式
This is a sparring program...
跟母體創造的世界很像
...similar to the programmed reality
of the Matrix.
一樣有地心引力等定律
It has the same basic rules.
Like gravity.
這些定律跟電腦系統沒兩樣
These rules are no different
than those of a computer system.
有些可以更改
Some of them can be bent.
有些甚至可以破解
Others...
...can be broken.
懂不懂？
Understand?
那就打我
Then hit me...
盡你所能
...if you can.
Good!
很好
融會…
Adaptation.
貫通
Improvisation.
不過你的弱點不在於技巧
But your weakness...
...is not your technique.
莫斐斯和尼歐對打
Morpheus is fighting Neo.
我是怎麼打敗你？
How did I beat you?
你太快了
You're too fast.
我在虛擬世界身手這麼敏捷
Do you believe that......my being stronger or faster...
跟我的肌肉發不發達有關嗎？
...has anything to do
with my muscles in this place?
你在這裡需要呼吸嗎？
You think you're breathing air?
再來一遍
Again!
天啊，他動作好快
Jesus Christ, he's fast!
他的運動神經異於常人
His neuro-kinetics
are way above normal.
你在等什麼？
What are you waiting for?
你的動作還要更快
You're faster than this.
別去懷疑
Don't think you are.
要有信心
Know you are.
來呀，別猶豫，直接打我
Come on! Stop trying to hit me,
and hit me!
我不敢相信
I don't believe it.
我知道你想做什麼
I know what you're trying to do.
我想解放你的心靈，尼歐
I'm trying to free your mind, Neo.
我只能開啟那道門
But I can only show you the door.
你得自己走過去
You have to walk through it.
坦克，載入跳躍程式
Tank, load the jump program.
你得擺脫一切，尼歐
恐懼
You have to let it all go, Neo.
Fear...
猶豫和懷疑
...doubt and disbelief.
解放你的心靈
Free your mind.
好吧
Okey-dokey.
解放心靈
Free my mind.
他行嗎？
What if he makes it?
沒有人第一次就成功
我知道
- No one's ever made their first jump.
- I know.
要是他能呢？
他不能
- But what if he does?
- He won't.
加油
Come on.
沒問題，解放心靈
All right.
No problem. Free my mind.
解放我的心靈，來吧
Free my mind. No problem. Right.
這代表什麼？
What does that mean?
這不代表什麼
It doesn't mean anything.
第一次每個人都會跌倒
Everybody falls the first time.
崔妮蒂，對吧？
Right, Trin?
我以為這是假的
你的大腦認為是真的
- I thought it wasn't real.
- Your mind makes it real.
在虛擬世界裡死亡
If you're killed in the Matrix...
也會死在這裡？
...you die here?
大腦死了，身體也活不了
The body cannot live without the mind.
你從來都沒送過晚餐給我
I don't remember you ever
bringing me dinner.
他與眾不同，對吧？
There is something about him,
isn't there?
別說你也相信了
You're a believer now?
要是莫斐斯這麼有信心
I keep wondering...
怎麼不帶他見祭師？
...if Morpheus is so sure,
why not take him to see the Oracle?
他準備好了就會去
Morpheus will take him
when he's ready.
母體是個系統，尼歐
The Matrix is a system, Neo.
就是我們的敵人
That system is our enemy.
你在虛擬世界看到什麼？
But when you're inside,
what do you see?
上班族、教師、律師、木匠
Businessmen, teachers,
lawyers, carpenters.
都是我們想拯救的人
The very minds of the people
we are trying to save.
目前這些人被系統控制
But until we do, these people are
a part of that system...
所以就是我們的敵人
...and that makes them our enemy.
你要瞭解
You have to understand...
許多人不能接受真實世界
...most of these people are not
ready to be unplugged.
更多人已經習慣…
And many of them are so inert...
非常無望地依賴這系統
...so hopelessly dependent
on the system...
...so hopelessly dependent
on the system...
願意誓死保護它
...that they will fight to protect it.
你在聽還是在看紅衣女郎？
Were you listening to me or looking
at the woman in the red dress?
再看一次
Look again.
停格
Freeze it.
我們不是在母體內？
This isn't the Matrix?
這是另一個訓練程式
用來教你一件事
It's another training program
designed to teach you one thing:
不是朋友就是敵人
If you are not one of us,
you are one of them.
誰是敵人？
有思想的電腦人
- What are they?
- Sentient programs.
他們能在任何軟體自由進出
不須更改他們的系統
They can move in and out of any software
still hardwired to their system.
我們尚未拯救的每個人
That means that anyone
we haven't unplugged...
都可能是電腦人
...is potentially an agent.
在虛擬世界裡
Inside the Matrix...
它們化身為任何人
...they are everyone...
它們無所不在
...and they are no one.
幸好我們能隱藏起來
並逃脫它們的追蹤
We have survived by hiding
and running from them...
它們是守衛
...but they are the gatekeepers.
把守每個門戶，掌握每個關鍵
They're guarding all the doors
and holding all the keys.
總有一個人遲早會把它們打敗
Sooner or later, someone will
have to fight them.
一個人？
Someone?
我不想騙你，尼歐
I won't lie to you, Neo.
任何單獨一人面對它們
每一個都打不過它們而喪命
Every single man or woman who
has fought an agent has died.
但是它們就打不過你，你會贏
But where they have failed,
you will succeed.
為什麼？
Why?
它們一拳能擊穿水泥牆
I've seen an agent punch
through a concrete wall.
被我們亂槍掃射卻毫髮無傷
Men have emptied entire clips at them
and hit nothing but air.
它們的力量卻受限於電腦系統
Yet their strength and speed are still
based in a world built on rules.
因此…
Because of that...
它們永遠都強不過你或快過你
...they will never be as strong
or as fast as you can be.
你想說什麼？
What are you telling me?
我能閃躲子彈嗎？
That I can dodge bullets?
不是，尼歐
No, Neo.
我是說當你準備好
I'm trying to tell you
that when you're ready...
就不必躲子彈
...you won't have to.
有麻煩了
We got trouble.
錫安傳來警告嗎？
Did Zion send the warning?
不，是我們的同志
No, another ship.
可惡
Shit.
烏賊追上來了
Squiddy's sweeping in quick.
烏賊？
Squiddy?
是艘巡邏艦，它們用來…
A sentinel. A killing machine
designed for one thing.
搜尋及毀滅
Search and destroy.
把船停在下面
Set her down there.
坦克，情況如何？
How are we doing, Tank?
切斷動力
Power off-line.
啟動 ＥＭＰ
EMP armed...
準備發射
...and ready.
就是電磁波
�ţͣУ�
Electromagnetic pulse.
能夠破壞任何電子系統
Disables any electrical system
in the blast radius.
對付烏賊唯一的武器
It's the only weapon we have
against the machines.
這是哪裡？
Where are we?
舊世界的排水系統
Their old service and waste systems.
下水道
Sewers.
這裡曾是數百哩大的城市
There used to be cities
that spanned hundreds of miles.
現在只剩下水道
Now these sewers are
all that's left.
安靜
Quiet.
你差點把我嚇死
You scared the bejesus out of me.
對不起
沒關係
- Sorry.
- It's okay.
那是…
Is that...?
母體？
The Matrix?
沒錯
全都是代碼嗎？
沒辦法
- Do you always look at it encoded?
- Well, you have to.
得用解碼器才能看到影像
The image translators work
for the construct program.
資訊太多根本無法完全破解
But there's way too much information
to decode the Matrix.
我習慣了，看到的已不是代碼
You get used to it.
I don't even see the code.
而是看到一個個性感美女
All I see is blonde, brunette, redhead.
你要…
Do you...
喝一杯嗎？
...want a drink?
好啊
Sure.
你知道嗎？
You know...
我知道你在想什麼
...I know what you're thinking.
因為我現在想的跟你一樣
Because right now I'm thinking
the same thing.
實際上我來了以後就一直在想
Actually, I've been thinking it
ever since I got here.
為什麼我不吞藍色藥丸呢？
Why, oh, why didn't I take
the blue pill?
好酒，對吧？
Good shit, huh?
道瑟釀的
Dozer makes it.
有兩個用處
It's good for two things:
去油污和破壞大腦細胞
Degreasing engines and
killing brain cells.
我可以問你嗎？
So can I ask you something?
他有沒有跟你說為何要這樣
Did he tell you why he did it?
為何找你來？
Why you're here?
我的媽呀
Jesus!
你是怎麼想的
What a mind job.
所以你來這裡是要拯救世界
So you're here to save the world.
說說看你要怎麼做？
What do you say
to something like that?
我給你個建議
A little piece of advice.
你看到電腦人
You see an agent...
要學我們…
...you do what we do:
快跑
Run.
拚命地跑
You run your ass off.
謝謝你的酒
Thanks for the drink.
祝有個好夢
Sweet dreams.
你答應嗎，雷根先生？
Do we have a deal, Mr. Reagan?
你知道嗎？
You know...
這塊牛排並不存在
...I know this steak doesn't exist.
當我把肉放進嘴裡
I know that when I put it
in my mouth...
母體會告訴我的大腦
...the Matrix is telling my brain
that it is...
這塊肉多汁
...juicy...
又美味
...and delicious.
過了九年…
After nine years...
苦日子，你知道嗎？
...you know what I realize?
無知就是快樂
Ignorance is bliss.
你答應了
Then we have a deal.
我要忘了這一切
I don't want to remember nothing.
這一切
Nothing.
明白嗎？
You understand?
我要當有錢人
And I want to be rich.
最好是重要人物
You know, someone important.
像是明星
Like an actor.
悉聽尊便，雷根先生
Whatever you want, Mr. Reagan.
把我的身體帶回去
Okay.
You get my body
back in a power plant...
重新接上母體
...reinsert me into the Matrix...
我就答應你
...I'll get you what you want.
給我錫安主機密碼
Access codes to the Zion mainframe.
不行，我不知道密碼
No. I told you, I don't know them.
我會交出知道的人
I can get you the man who does.
莫斐斯
Morpheus.
來吧，拿去
你的營養早餐
Here you go, buddy.
Breakfast of champions.
閉上眼睛假裝這是荷包蛋
Close your eyes, it feels
like you're eating runny eggs.
或是一坨鼻涕
Or a bowl of snot.
我倒覺得有點像
You know what it reminds me of?
早餐麥片，你吃過嗎？
Tastee Wheat. Did you
ever eat Tastee Wheat?
沒，實際上誰都沒吃過
No, but technically,
neither did you.
一點也沒錯
That's exactly my point. Exactly.
這不禁令人納悶
Because you have to wonder...
電腦怎麼知道麥片的味道？
...how do the machines really know
what Tastee Wheat tasted like?
也許它們搞錯了
Maybe they got it wrong.
也許麥片的味道其實很像…
Maybe what I think Tastee Wheat
tasted like actually tasted like...
鮪魚三明治
...oatmeal or tuna fish.
我開始懷疑，就拿雞肉來說
That makes you wonder.
Take chicken, for example.
它們搞不清雞肉的味道
Maybe they didn't know
what to make it taste like...
所以和很多肉都像，也許…
...which is why it tastes
like everything.
閉嘴
- And maybe they...
- Shut up.
這是蛋白質
It's a single-celled protein...
維他命和礦物質
...combined with synthetic aminos,
vitamins and minerals.
人類只需要這些
Everything the body needs.
人類也有別的需要
It doesn't have everything
the body needs.
你接受過辨識敵友訓練
I understand you've run through
the agent training program.
程式是我寫的
You know, I wrote that program.
又來了
Here it comes.
你覺得她怎樣？
誰？
- What did you think of her?
- Of who?
我設計的紅衣女郎
The woman in the red dress.
I designed her.
她話不多，不過…
She doesn't talk very much...
你想見她，我可以安排
...but if you'd like to meet her,
I can arrange a more personal milieu.
活像個皮條客
The digital pimp hard at work.
別管這些偽君子
Pay no attention to
these hypocrites, Neo.
壓抑自己的情慾
To deny our own impulses...
就是否定與生俱來的人性
...is to deny the very thing
that makes us human.
道瑟，吃完後
Dozer, when you're done...
把船開上去進行傳送
...bring the ship up to broadcast depth.
我們要進去
We're going in.
我要帶尼歐去看她
I'm taking Neo to see her.
看誰？
See who?
祭師
The Oracle.
各位乘客
Everyone, please observe...
請繫好安全帶，請勿吸煙
...the "fasten seat belt"
and "no smoking" signs are on.
請坐好，好好享受旅程
Sit back and enjoy your flight.
進去了
We're in.
一小時後回來
We'll be back in an hour.
很不可思議
Unbelievable...
對吧？
...isn't it?
天啊
怎麼了？
- God!
- What?
我常在那兒吃飯
I used to eat there.
面很好吃
Really good noodles.
我這一生中的記憶
I have these memories from my life.
全都沒發生
None of them happened.
這代表什麼？
What does that mean?
母體不知道你是誰
That the Matrix cannot tell you
who you are.
祭師就知道？
But an oracle can?
那不同
That's different.
你見過她？
Did you go to her?
見過
Yes.
她跟你說什麼？
What did she tell you?
她跟我說…
She told me...
什麼？
What?
到了
We're here.
尼歐，跟我來
Come with me.
這個祭師曾經…
So is this the same oracle
that made...
做出預言？
...the prophecy?
是，她很老，一開始就幫我們
Yes. She's very old. She's been
with us since the beginning.
一開始？
The beginning?
反抗運動
Of the Resistance.
她無所不知嗎？
And she knows what? Everything?
她知道得不少
She would say she knows enough.
她沒有錯過
And she's never wrong.
別拘泥於對或是錯
Try not to think of it
in terms of right and wrong.
她是引導者
She is a guide, Neo.
可以幫你找到道路
She can help you to find the path.
她幫過你？
She helped you?
對
她怎麼說？
What did she tell you?
我會找到救世主
That I would find the One.
我只能帶你到門口
I told you I can only
show you the door.
你得自己進去
You have to walk through it.
嗨！尼歐
Hello, Neo.
你很準時
You're right on time.
莫斐斯，隨便坐
你跟我來
Make yourself at home, Morpheus.
Neo, come with me.
這些是候選人
These are the other Potentials.
在這兒等
You can wait here.
別試著折彎湯匙
Do not try and bend the spoon.
那是不可能的
That's impossible.
你要試著看清真相
Instead, only try
to realize the truth.
什麼真相？
What truth?
湯匙不存在
There is no spoon.
沒有湯匙？
There is no spoon?
改變的不是湯匙，而是你自己
Then you'll see that it is not the spoon
that bends. It is only yourself.
祭師要見你
The Oracle will you see now.
我知道你是尼歐
I know you're Neo.
我馬上來
Be right with you.
你就是祭師？
You're the Oracle?
答對了
Bingo.
跟你想像的不一樣，對吧？
Not quite what you
were expecting, right?
快好了
Almost done.
很香，對吧？
Smell good, don't they?
我就不請你坐了
I'd ask you to sit down...
反正你也不會坐
...but you're not going to anyway.
花瓶的事沒關係
And don't worry about the vase.
什麼花瓶？
What vase?
那個花瓶
That vase.
對不起
I'm sorry.
我說沒關係
I said, don't worry about it.
我會叫那些孩子修
I'll get one of my kids to fix it.
你怎麼知道？
How did you know?
讓你覺得更困惑的是…
What's really going to bake
your noodle later on is...
我不說你會打破花瓶嗎？
...would you still have broken it
if I hadn't said anything?
你比我想的更帥
You're cuter than I thought.
難怪她喜歡你
I can see why she likes you.
誰？
Who?
你不太聰明
Not too bright, though.
莫斐斯對你很有信心
You know why Morpheus
brought you to see me.
你覺得呢？
So...
...what do you think?
你是救世主嗎？
Do you think you are the One?
老實說，不知道
I don't know.
你看得懂嗎？
You know what that means?
拉丁文
It's Latin.
意思是「瞭解自己」
Means, "Know thyself."
我跟你說個秘密
I'll let you in on a little secret.
當救世主就像談戀愛
Being the One is just
like being in love.
沒什麼道理，你卻很確定
No one can tell you you're in love.
You just know it...
全身上下都知道
...through and through.
Balls to bones.
我最好看看你
Well...
...I'd better have a look at you.
張開口說「啊」
Open your mouth. Say, "Ah."
現在我該說
Okay...
有意思，不過…
Now I'm supposed to say,
"Hmm, that's interesting, but..."
你要反問
Then you say:
不過什麼？
But what?
你早就知道我要說什麼
But you already know
what I'm going to tell you.
我不是救世主
I'm not the One.
小子，很抱歉
Sorry, kid.
你很有潛力
You got the gift...
不過你在等待什麼
...but it looks like
you're waiting for something.
等什麼？
What?
等著投胎轉世吧，誰知道？
Your next life, maybe. Who knows?
事情就是這麼無奈
That's the way these things go.
有什麼好笑？
What's funny?
莫斐斯
Morpheus.
我差點就相信他
He almost had me convinced.
我知道
I know.
可憐的莫斐斯
Poor Morpheus.
沒有他，我們早就輸了
Without him, we're lost.
那是什麼意思？
What do you mean, "without him"?
你真的想聽？
Are you sure you want
to hear this?
莫斐斯相信你，尼歐
Morpheus believes in you, Neo.
沒有任何人，包括你和我
And no one, not you, not even me...
也勸動不了他
...can convince him otherwise.
他為了這盲目的信念
He believes it so blindly...
願意犧牲自己救你一命
...that he's going to sacrifice
his life to save yours.
什麼？
What?
你必須做出選擇
You're going to
have to make a choice.
一方面是莫斐斯的性命
In the one hand,
you'll have Morpheus' life.
另一方面是你自己的
And in the other hand,
you'll have your own.
你們其中一個會死
One of you is going to die.
你能決定…
哪一個會死
Which one will be up to you.
真是抱歉，你的心腸很好
I'm sorry, kiddo. I really am.
You have a good soul.
我不想跟你說這壞消息
And I hate giving
good people bad news.
不過別擔心
Don't worry about it.
你一出去心情就會好多了
As soon as you
step outside that door...
...you'll start feeling better.
你不相信什麼狗屁命運
You'll remember you don't believe
in any of this fate crap.
你掌控自己的生命
You're in control of your own life.
記得嗎？
Remember?
來
Here...
吃塊餅乾
...take a cookie.
我保證等你吃完餅乾
I promise, by the time
you're done eating it...
就會心情開朗
...you'll feel right as rain.
她想說的話
What was said...
只是針對你
...was for you...
只有你能聽
...and for you alone.
「紅衣女郎」
他們回去了
They're on the way.
什麼玩意？
What is that?
似曾相識
Oh, d□?vu.
你說什麼？
What did you just say?
沒什麼，我眼花了
Just d□?vu.
Nothing.
看到什麼？
怎麼了？
- What did you see?
- What happened?
一隻黑貓走過去
A black cat went past us...
另一隻又過去
...then another just like it.
是同一隻貓嗎？
Was it the same cat?
我不確定
I'm not sure.
蘇薇琪、艾巴
Switch, Apoc.
怎麼了？
What is it?
通常電腦有變動才會這樣
A d□?vu is usually a glitch in the
Matrix when they change something.
我的天
Oh, my God.
走吧
Let's go.
被切斷，是陷阱，快走
They cut the hard line.
It's a trap! Get out!
糟了
Oh, no.
糟了
我們被困住，出不去
That's what they changed.
We're trapped.
冷靜，電話給我
Be calm. Give me your phone.
他們能追蹤
They'll be able to track it.
沒辦法
We have no choice.
這是總機
Operator.
快找出旅館的藍圖，快點
Find a structural drawing of
this building. Find it fast.
找到了
管線入口在哪裡？
- Got it!
- I need the main wet-wall.
八樓
Eighth floor.
他們在八樓
They're on the eighth floor.
蘇薇琪，就在前面
Switch, straight ahead.
尼歐
希望你真是救世主
I hope the Oracle
gave you some good news.
左邊，到了
Now left. That's it.
很好
Good.
他們在哪裡？
Where are they?
在牆裡面
They're in the walls.
在牆裡面
In the walls!
是電腦人
It's an agent!
莫斐斯
救出尼歐
You must get Neo out!
他最重要
He's all that matters!
不，莫斐斯別去
No, Morpheus! Don't!
快去吧
Trinity, go!
走吧
Go!
不能丟下他
一定要
- We can't leave him!
- We have to!
快點
Come on!
The great Morpheus.
We meet at last.
你是誰？
And you are?
史密斯
A Smith.
電腦人
Agent Smith.
你們長得都一樣
You all look the same to me.
把他帶走
Take him.
不！
總機
我要找到出口
- Operator.
- I need an exit, fast.
出了意外，是車禍
There was an accident.
Goddamn car accident.
突然就撞車
All of a sudden, boom.
上帝保佑我
Somebody up there still likes me.
找到你了
I got you.
快把我救回去
Just get me out of here fast.
出口在法蘭克街的修理店
Nearest exit, Franklin and Erie.
An old TV repair shop.
好
Right.
總機
坦克，是我
- Operator.
- Tank, it's me.
莫斐斯還活著嗎？
Is Morpheus alive?
他還活著嗎？
Is Morpheus alive, Tank?
他被他們帶走了
Yes. They're moving him.
I don 't know where.
他沒死，我們得逃走
He's alive. We need an exit.
塞佛在附近
You're not far from Cypher.
塞佛？
- Cypher?
- I know.
我知道，他在法蘭克街
收到
- I sent him to Franklin and Erie.
- Got it.
接到了
Got him.
他們呢？
Where are they?
我在打電話
Making the call.
很好
Good.
你先走
You first.
該死
Shit!
不！
我不知道，電話突然斷線
I don't know. It just went dead.
你好，崔妮蒂
Hello, Trinity.
塞佛，坦克呢？
Cypher? Where's Tank?
你知道嗎？
You know...
常久以來
...for a long time...
我以為我愛上你
...I thought I was in love with you.
我常夢到你
I used to dream about you.
你是個美女，崔妮蒂
You're a beautiful woman, Trinity.
可惜是這種結局
Too bad things had to
turn out this way.
你殺死他們
You killed them.
什麼？
老天
- What?
- Oh, God.
我累了，崔妮蒂
I'm tired, Trinity.
我討厭這場戰爭
I'm tired of this war...
我不想打仗，我恨這艘船
...tired of fighting.
I'm tired of this ship...
冷冰冰的，每天吃那坨漿糊
...of being cold, of eating
the same goddamn goop every day.
我最恨的是…
But most of all...
我受不了那傢伙的癡心妄想
...I'm tired of that jackoff
and all of his bullshit.
嚇一跳吧
Surprise, asshole!
你一定沒想到
I bet you never saw this coming...
對不對？
...did you?
我真希望當時在場
God, I wish I could be there...
看他們如何扁你
...when they break you.
我真想親眼目睹
I wish I could walk in
just when it happens...
讓你知道是我幹的
...so right then...
...you'd know it was me.
你背叛莫斐斯
You gave them Morpheus.
他耍我們，崔妮蒂
He lied to us, Trinity.
他欺騙我們
He tricked us!
要是你告訴我們實話
If you had told us the truth...
我們就不會吞下紅色藥丸
...we would've told you to shove
that red pill up your ass!
錯了，塞佛，他給我們自由
That is not true, Cypher.
He set us free.
自由？這也叫自由嗎？
"Free."
You call this free?
我只能聽他的話
All I do is what he tells me to do.
在他和母體之間
If I had to choose between
that and the Matrix...
我會選擇母體
...I choose the Matrix.
母體是虛擬世界
The Matrix isn't real.
我不同意，崔妮蒂
I disagree, Trinity.
我認為母體…
I think the Matrix...
比這個世界還要真實
...can be more real than this world.
我只要拔掉插頭
All I do is pull the plug here.
在母體裡
But there...
你就得眼睜睜看著他死
...you have to watch Apoc die.
不！
歡迎到真實世界
Welcome to the real world.
你被帶出來，回不去了
But you're out.
不見得
- You can 't go back.
- That's what you think.
我會重新接上母體
They'll reinsert my body.
睡一覺起來就會忘記一切
I go back to sleep. When I wake up,
I won 't remember a thing.
對了
By the way...
你想跟蘇薇琪講話
...if you have anything important
to say to Switch...
趁現在快說
...say it now.
住手
No, please don't.
我不想這樣死
Not like this.
我不想死
Not like this.
太遲了
Too late.
你真該死，塞佛
Goddamn you, Cypher!
別恨我，崔妮蒂
Don't hate me, Trinity.
我只是信差
I'm just a messenger.
現在，我要證明給你看
And right now,
I'm going to prove it to you.
要是莫斐斯沒錯
If Morpheus was right...
我就殺不了他
...there's no way
I can pull this plug.
如果尼歐是救世主
If Neo 's the One...
就一定會發生奇跡阻止我
...then there'd have to be...
...some kind of a miracle to stop me.
對吧？
Right?
我是說他死了怎麼當救世主？
I mean, how can he be the One...
...if he's dead?
你沒說你信不信莫斐斯的屁話
You never did answer me before...
...if you bought into
Morpheus ' bullshit.
拜託，我只要你說信或不信
Come on. All I want
is a little yes or no.
看著他的雙眼
Look into his eyes...
那對帥氣的雙眸
...those big, pretty eyes...
告訴我
...and tell me...
你信
...yes...
或不信？
...or no.
我信
Yes.
我不相信
I don't believe it.
渾蛋，你信不信都會下地獄
Believe it or not, you piece of shit,
you're still going to burn!
你先去
You first.
你受傷了
You're hurt.
我沒事
I'll be all right.
道瑟呢？
Dozer?
你有沒有看著這世界
Have you ever stood and stared at it?
驚歎它的完美和…
Marveled at its beauty...
造物主的天才呢？
...its genius?
億萬人口渾渾噩噩過活
Billions of people...
...just living out their lives.
完全無知
Oblivious.
你知道第一個母體…
Did you know that the first Matrix...
被設計成沒有痛苦的世界
...was designed to be a perfect
human world where none suffered...
當時每個人都很快樂
...where everyone would be happy.
結果沒人習慣這種生活
It was a disaster.
整批人都死亡
No one would accept the program.
Entire crops were lost.
有些電腦人相信
Some believe that...
我們無法設計完美人類世界
...we lacked the programming language
to describe your perfect world.
不過我卻認為原來的…
But I believe that...
...as a species...
人類是透過痛苦和苦難
...human beings define
their reality through misery...
來面對真實
...and suffering.
所以完美世界是場噩夢
So the perfect world was a dream...
你們人類不斷想要從中驚醒
...that your primitive cerebrum
kept trying to wake up from.
所以母體才要經過重新設計
Which is why the Matrix was
redesigned to this.
呈現二十世紀末文明
The peak...
...of your civilization.
本來是你們的文明
I say, "your civilization"...
換了主人就成為我們的文明
...because when we started thinking
for you, it became our civilization...
就是這麼一回事
...which is, of course,
what this is all about.
這就是演化過程，莫斐斯
Evolution, Morpheus.
演化過程
Evolution.
就像恐龍滅亡
Like the dinosaur.
看著窗外
Look out that window.
人類曾有輝煌歲月
You had your time.
但是未來屬於我們的，莫斐斯
The future is our world, Morpheus.
我們是未來的主人
The future is our time.
有個問題
There could be a problem.
它們在做什麼？
侵入他的大腦
- What are they doing to him?
- They're breaking into his mind.
就像侵入電腦，得花點時間
It's like hacking a computer.
All it takes is time.
多少時間？
How much time?
他很堅強
但是遲早會崩潰
Depends on the mind.
But eventually, it'll crack...
他的腦波會逐漸被控制
完全控制後
...and his alpha patterns
will change from this to this.
莫斐斯什麼都會說出來
When it does, he'll tell them
anything they want to know.
它們要什麼？
What do they want?
叛軍領袖都有錫安主機密碼
The leader of every ship is given codes
to Zion's mainframe computer.
要是電腦人侵入錫安主機
If an agent got the codes
and got into Zion's mainframe...
我們就毀了
絕不能讓它們得逞
...they could destroy us.
We can't let that happen.
錫安比你或我都重要
Zion's more important than me...
...or you...
甚至莫斐斯
...or even Morpheus.
一定有辦法
There has to be
something we can do.
有，拔掉插頭
There is. We pull the plug.
你打算要殺他
You're going to kill him?
殺死莫斐斯？
Kill Morpheus?
我們別無選擇
We don't have a choice.
人類就是沒有用
Never send a human
to do a machine's job.
我們的內線失敗
If the insider has failed...
他們會拔掉他的插頭
...they'll sever the connection
as soon as possible, unless...
也許他們死了
They're dead. In either case...
我們得照計畫進行
We have no choice. Continue as planned.
Deploy the sentinels.
馬上派出烏賊
Immediately.
莫斐斯，你不只是領導
Morpheus, you were more
than a leader to us.
更像是父親
You were a father.
我們會永遠懷念你
We'll miss you always.
住手
Stop!
我們不能這麼做
I don't believe this is happening.
只能這麼做
是嗎？
- Neo, this has to be done.
- Does it?
我不確定
I don't know.
這一定不是巧合
This can't be just coincidence.
什麼？
What?
祭師說會發生這種事
The Oracle.
She told me this would happen.
她跟我說
我必須做選擇
She told me that I would
have to make a choice.
什麼選擇？
What choice?
你在幹嘛？
What are you doing?
我要進去
I'm going in.
不行，你不能
No, you're not.
我一定要去
I have to.
他犧牲自己把你救出來
Neo, Morpheus sacrificed himself
so that we could get you out.
你不能再回去
There is no way
that you're going back in.
我不是他認為的那個人
Morpheus did what he did because
he believed I'm something I'm not.
什麼？
我不是救世主，崔妮蒂
I'm not the One, Trinity.
祭師說的
不，你一定是
- The Oracle hit me with that too.
- No, you have to be.
抱歉，我不是，我只是凡人
I'm sorry, I'm not.
I'm just another guy.
不，尼歐，這不是真的
No, Neo, that's not true.
這不可能是真的
It can't be true.
為什麼？
Why?
你瘋了，那兒有軍隊防守
This is loco. They've got Morpheus
in a military-controlled building.
而且有三個電腦人在看守他
Even if you somehow got inside, those
are agents holding him. Three of them.
我也想救他，不過你這是自殺
I want Morpheus back too, but
what you're talking about is suicide.
我知道你不會瞭解
That's what it looks like...
...but it's not.
我也不會解釋
I can't explain to you why it's not.
莫斐斯有個信念
他願意為它犧牲生命
Morpheus believed something, and
he was ready to give his life for it.
我能體會，所以我得去
I understand that now.
That's why I have to go.
為什麼？
Why?
因為我也有信念
Because I believe in something.
什麼信念？
What?
我相信我能把他救走
I believe I can bring him back.
你幹嘛？
我跟你去
- What are you doing?
- Going with you.
不行
No, you're not.
不行？
"No"?
讓我告訴你
Let me tell you what I believe.
我比你更關心莫斐斯
Morpheus means more to me
than he does to you.
你真想救他就需要我的幫助
I believe if you are serious about
saving him, you will need my help.
我比你資深
And since I am the ranking officer...
如果你不滿意，就不如去死
...if you don't like it,
I believe you can go to hell.
沒有我，你死定了
Because you aren't going anywhere else.
坦克
Tank...
開始吧
...Ioad us up.
我想跟你分享一個心得
I'd like to share
a revelation that I've had...
當我在母體內
...during my time here.
我在為你們分類時有個領悟
It came to me when I tried
to classify your species...
我發現你們不是哺乳動物
...and I realized...
...that you're not actually mammals.
地球的哺乳動物
Every mammal on this planet...
都會和大自然維持平衡生態
...instinctively develops an equilibrium
with the surrounding environment.
人類卻不會
But you humans do not.
你們每到一處就拚命利用
You move to an area
and you multiply...
直到耗盡所有的大自然資源
...and multiply until every
natural resource is consumed.
生存的唯一辦法
The only way you can survive...
就是侵佔別處
...is to spread to another area.
地球上只有另一種生物
There is another organism
on this planet...
才會這麼做
...that follows the same pattern.
你知道是什麼嗎？
Do you know what it is?
病毒
A virus.
人類
是種疾病
Human beings are a disease.
你們是地球的癌症和瘟疫
A cancer of this planet.
You are a plague.
而我們電腦就是解藥
And we...
...are the cure.
好吧，除了奇跡
Okay, so what do you need?
你還要什麼？
Besides a miracle.
槍枝
Guns.
很多槍枝
Lots of guns.
尼歐
沒人敢做這種嘗試
No one has ever done
anything like this.
所以才會成功
That's why it's going to work.
迷藥為什麼沒用？
Why isn't the serum working?
也許我們問得不對
Perhaps we're asking
the wrong questions.
你們先出去
Leave me with him.
馬上
Now.
撐著點，莫斐斯，他們去救你
Hold on, Morpheus.
他們來了
They're coming for you.
They're coming.
莫斐斯，你聽得到嗎？
Can you hear me, Morpheus?
要要老實…
I'm going to be honest...
跟你說
...with you.
我…
I...
恨…
...hate...
這地方
...this place...
這座動物園，這間牢獄…
...this zoo...
...this prison...
這個真實，隨便你怎麼說
...this reality,
whatever you want to call it.
我再也受不了了
I can't stand it any longer.
都是那味道
It's the smell.
真有味道的話
If there is such a thing.
我覺得這味道包圍著我
I feel saturated by it.
我甚至可以嘗到…
I can...
...taste...
你的臭味
...your stink.
每次我都怕受到你感染
And every time I do, I fear that
I have somehow been infected by it.
很噁心
It's repulsive.
對不對？
Isn't it?
我一定要出去
I must get out of here.
我必須離開
I must get free.
而方法卻在你腦裡
And in this mind is the key.
它是屬於我的
My key.
只要毀滅錫安，我就可以走
Once Zion is destroyed,
there is no need for me to be here.
你明白嗎？
Do you understand?
我要密碼
I need the codes.
你得告訴我怎麼侵入錫安主機
I have to get inside Zion...
你是選擇說出來
...and you have to tell me how.
還是要我賜你一死
You're going to tell me...
...or you're going to die.
請拿掉金屬品，鑰匙或零錢
Please remove any metallic items
you're carrying. Keys, loose change.
天啊
Holy shit!
支援
Backup.
快派人支援
Send backup.
站住
Freeze!
你在幹嘛？
What were you doing?
他不知道
He doesn't know.
知道什麼？
Know what?
他們想把他救走
I think they're trying to save him.
湯匙不存在
There is no spoon.
找出來並殺了他們
Find them and destroy them!
重覆，我們遭到攻擊
We're under attack!
崔妮蒂
幫幫忙
Help!
只殺人類
Only human.
你躲呀
Dodge this.
如何做的？
做什麼？
- How did you do that?
- Do what?
跟它們一樣快
我沒見過這麼快的人
You moved like they do.
I've never seen anyone move that fast.
還不夠快
It wasn't fast enough.
你會開嗎？
Can you fly that thing?
還不會
Not yet.
總機
Operator.
我要直升機的駕駛程式
I need a pilot program
for a B-212 helicopter.
快點
Hurry.
走吧
Let's go.
不會吧
No.
莫斐斯，起來
Morpheus, get up.
起來
Get up, get up.
他跳不過來
He's not going to make it.
抓到你了
Got you.
我就知道
I knew it.
他是救世主
He's the One.
崔妮蒂，你相信了嗎？
Do you believe it now, Trinity?
莫斐斯
祭師…
The Oracle.
她跟我說…
她已告訴你
- She told me...
- She told you...
你需要聽的話
...what you needed to hear.
就說到這裡
That's all.
尼歐，你遲早會知道…
Sooner or later you'll realize,
just as I did...
知道你的未來不夠
...there's a difference
between knowing the path...
你得體驗
...and walking the path.
總機
Operator.
坦克
聽到你的聲音真好
- It's good to hear your voice.
- We need an exit.
我們需要出口
有了，州立街和包威街地鐵站
Got one ready. Subway station,
State and Balboa.
可惡
Damn it!
追蹤完畢
The trace was completed.
找到他們了
We have their position.
烏賊正在待命
Sentinels are standing by.
命令它們攻擊
Order the strike.
他們還沒走
They're not out yet.
你先走
You first, Morpheus.
尼歐，我要告訴你一件事
Neo, I want to tell you something...
不過我很怕
會有不好的結果
...but I'm afraid of
what it could mean if I do.
祭師跟我說的都成真
Everything the Oracle
told me has come true.
除此之外
Everything but this.
除了什麼？
But what?
尼歐
發生什麼事？
- What happened?
- An agent.
是電腦人，送我回去
Send me back.
不行
I can't.
安德森先生
Mr. Anderson.
尼歐，快跑
Run, Neo. Run.
他在幹什麼？
What is he doing?
他開始相信了
He's beginning to believe.
你沒子彈了
You're empty.
你也一樣
So are you.
我打算看著你死
I'm going to enjoy watching you die...
安德森先生
...Mr. Anderson.
老天，他活不成
Jesus, he's killing him.
你聽到了嗎？
You hear that, Mr. Anderson?
這是命運的轟隆聲
That is the sound of inevitability.
你的死期到了
It is the sound of your death.
再見，安德森先生
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.
我的名字是…
My name...
尼歐
...is Neo.
怎麼回事？
他不見了
- What happened?
- I don't know. I lost him.
「敵人接近中」
糟糕
Oh, shit.
烏賊
Sentinels.
還有多久？
五、六分鐘
- How long?
- Five, maybe six minutes.
啟動電磁波
Tank, charge the EMP.
他出來才能發射
我知道，別擔心
- We can't use that until he's out.
- I know. Don't worry.
他逃得出來
He's gonna make it.
Flat or pumps? No, just...
搞什麼？那是我的電話
What the shit? That's my phone!
他搶走我電話
That guy took my phone!
找到了，他正在逃
Got him!
He's on the run.
老兄，快把我救走
Mr. Wizard...
...get me out of here!
華伯和雷克街有出口
I got an old exit.
Wabash and Lake.
可惡
Oh, shit!
求助，我需要幫個小忙
Help! Need a little help!
那道門
The door.
左手邊的門
The door on your left.
另一邊
Your other left!
走後門
The back door.
「警戒」
不！
Oh, no.
它們來了
Here they come.
他回得來
He's going to make it.
走廊盡頭的 303 室
The fire escape at the end
of the alley, room 303.
「警告」
它們鑽進來了
They're inside.
快點
Hurry, Neo.
不可能
It can't be.
他死了嗎？
Check him.
他死了
He's gone.
再見，安德森先生
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.
我不再害怕
I'm not afraid anymore.
祭師說我會愛上一個人
The Oracle told me...
那個人是救世主
...I'd fall in love, and that
the man I loved would be the One.
所以…
So you see...
你不可能會死
...you can't be dead.
不可能
You can't be...
因為我愛你
...because I love you.
聽到了嗎？
You hear me?
我愛你
I love you.
起來吧
Now, get up.
No.
怎麼會？
How?
他是救世主
He is the One.
尼歐
不！
我知道你們在聽
I know you're out there.
我感覺得到
I can feel you now.
我知道你們很怕我們
I know that you're afraid.
You're afraid of us.
也很怕改變
You're afraid of change.
未來不可知
I don 't know the future.
「系統當機」
我不知道該怎麼結束
I didn 't come here to tell you
how this is going to end.
我只知道該怎麼開始
I came here to tell you
how it's going to begin.
我要掛斷電話
I'll hang up this phone.
讓芸芸眾生見到真實世界
And then I'll show these people
what you don 't want them to see.
一個沒有電腦的世界
I'm going to show them a world...
...without you.
沒有硬性規定和任何界線
A world without rules and controls,
without borders or boundaries.
一個充滿可能性的世界
A world where anything is possible.
以後的發展就讓你們決定
Where we go from there...
...is a choice I leave to you.
