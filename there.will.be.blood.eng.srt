1
00:04:42,401 --> 00:04:43,859
No!

2
00:05:17,103 --> 00:05:19,767
There she is. There she is.

3
00:05:28,981 --> 00:05:30,605
There she is.

4
00:14:18,777 --> 00:14:20,768
Ladies and gentlemen,

5
00:14:20,913 --> 00:14:25,043
l've traveled over half our
state to be here tonight.

6
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:27,675
l couldn't get away sooner
because my new well was coming in

7
00:14:27,786 --> 00:14:30,687
at Coyote Hills
and l had to see about it.

8
00:14:30,789 --> 00:14:33,781
That well is now flowing
at 2,000 barrels

9
00:14:33,926 --> 00:14:37,089
and it's paying me an income
of $5,000 a week.

10
00:14:37,763 --> 00:14:39,175
l have two others drilling

11
00:14:39,175 --> 00:14:41,062
and l have 16 producing
at Antelope,

12
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,425
so, ladies and gentlemen

13
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:45,602
if l say l'm an oilman,
you will agree.

14
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,102
Now, you have a great
chance here,

15
00:14:51,243 --> 00:14:54,110
but bear in mind you could lose
it all if you're not careful.

16
00:14:54,246 --> 00:14:56,612
Out of all men that beg for
a chance to drill your lots,

17
00:14:56,748 --> 00:14:59,945
maybe one in twenty
will be oilmen.

18
00:15:00,052 --> 00:15:01,280
The rest will be speculators,

19
00:15:01,386 --> 00:15:03,911
that's men trying to get
between you and the oilmen

20
00:15:04,022 --> 00:15:07,617
to get some of the money that
ought, by rights, come to you.

21
00:15:07,726 --> 00:15:09,499
Even if you find one that
has money

22
00:15:09,499 --> 00:15:10,661
and means to drill,

23
00:15:10,796 --> 00:15:13,230
he'll maybe know nothing
about drilling.

24
00:15:13,332 --> 00:15:15,300
He'll have to hire the job
out on contract,

25
00:15:15,434 --> 00:15:18,232
and then you're depending
on a contractor,

26
00:15:18,337 --> 00:15:19,395
who'll rush the job through

27
00:15:19,504 --> 00:15:21,597
so he can get another contract
just as quick as he can.

28
00:15:21,707 --> 00:15:23,265
This is the way that this works.

29
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:26,640
What is your offer?
We're wasting time.

30
00:15:26,945 --> 00:15:27,912
Please!

31
00:15:31,149 --> 00:15:33,083
l do my own drilling.

32
00:15:33,752 --> 00:15:35,863
And the men that work for me,

33
00:15:35,863 --> 00:15:37,620
work for me and they are
men l know.

34
00:15:37,756 --> 00:15:41,453
l make it my business to be
there and to see their work.

35
00:15:41,593 --> 00:15:43,112
l don't lose my tools in the hole

36
00:15:43,112 --> 00:15:44,653
and spend months fishing for them.

37
00:15:44,796 --> 00:15:45,922
l don't botch the cementing off

38
00:15:46,031 --> 00:15:49,592
and let water in the hole
and ruin the whole lease.

39
00:15:49,735 --> 00:15:51,726
l'm a family man.

40
00:15:51,837 --> 00:15:52,800
l run a family business

41
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,467
This is my son and my partner,
H.W. Plainview.

42
00:15:57,476 --> 00:15:59,737
We offer you the bond of family

43
00:15:59,737 --> 00:16:02,277
that very few oilmen
can understand.

44
00:16:04,249 --> 00:16:07,309
l'm fixed like no other
company in this field

45
00:16:07,452 --> 00:16:10,615
and that's because my Coyote Hills
well has just come in.

46
00:16:10,756 --> 00:16:13,190
l have a string of tools
all ready to put to work.

47
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:15,418
l can load a rig onto trucks
and have them here in a week.

48
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,090
l have business connections

49
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:18,620
so l can get the lumber
for the derricks.

50
00:16:18,764 --> 00:16:20,647
Such things go by friendship

51
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:22,530
in a rush like this.

52
00:16:22,668 --> 00:16:23,393
And this is why l can

53
00:16:23,393 --> 00:16:26,502
guarantee to start drilling

54
00:16:26,638 --> 00:16:29,573
and to put up the cash
to back my word.

55
00:16:29,675 --> 00:16:31,233
l assure you, ladies and gentlemen,

56
00:16:31,343 --> 00:16:34,642
no matter what the others
promise to do,

57
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:38,181
when it comes to the showdown,
they won't be there.

58
00:16:39,451 --> 00:16:42,420
Sit down! Sit down,
you have no right...

59
00:16:43,288 --> 00:16:44,256
Let us discuss
what the man has to say.

60
00:16:44,256 --> 00:16:45,450
Let us discuss what the
man has to say.

61
00:16:45,557 --> 00:16:47,053
Prescott, do you trust
this man?

62
00:16:47,053 --> 00:16:48,549
Let's discuss
what he has to say.

63
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,389
There's logic to
what he's saying.

64
00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:52,118
How does he know?
My lot is there!

65
00:16:53,965 --> 00:16:57,093
Two or three years,
it could be ten years!

66
00:16:57,202 --> 00:16:58,766
We gain nothing
by losing our heads!

67
00:16:58,766 --> 00:17:00,330
Look at that well out there!

68
00:17:00,439 --> 00:17:01,963
Nobody's losing their heads.

69
00:17:02,941 --> 00:17:05,501
You have no business being here!

70
00:17:06,478 --> 00:17:08,946
Sit that woman down, sir!

71
00:17:10,615 --> 00:17:11,980
You can sit down.

72
00:17:12,117 --> 00:17:14,585
Mr. Plainview! Please,
Mr. Plainview.

73
00:17:15,687 --> 00:17:17,678
No, Mr. Plainview!
No, where are you going?

74
00:17:17,789 --> 00:17:19,550
l don't need the lease.
Thank you.

75
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:20,883
But we need you.

76
00:17:20,992 --> 00:17:23,222
Too much confusion.
Thank you for your time.

77
00:17:23,328 --> 00:17:24,989
No, no, there's no confusion.

78
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:26,499
l wouldn't take the lease

79
00:17:26,499 --> 00:17:28,793
if you gave it to me as a gift.

80
00:17:39,478 --> 00:17:42,242
Mr. Bankside, l'm not going
to waste your time.

81
00:17:42,347 --> 00:17:44,815
l'd certainly appreciate it
if you didn't waste mine.

82
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:46,003
Now, if you wish to sign with me

83
00:17:46,003 --> 00:17:49,649
we can have a well drilling
within 10 days.

84
00:17:49,755 --> 00:17:53,156
Your lot is further north from
the discovery well up here.

85
00:17:53,325 --> 00:17:55,850
That means we'll probably
have to dig deeper.

86
00:17:55,994 --> 00:17:56,940
And if there's as much

87
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,360
oil here as l think there is,

88
00:17:58,497 --> 00:18:01,489
it'll be harder to reach, but once
we find it, we can take it right out.

89
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,196
We have to act quickly, because
very soon these fields will be dry.

90
00:18:06,338 --> 00:18:08,636
l need you to know
what you want to do.

91
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:11,766
Now, because of the distance
from the discovery well,

92
00:18:11,877 --> 00:18:14,141
l'll pay you a smaller royalty
than you'd get down there

93
00:18:14,246 --> 00:18:18,080
but l'm prepared to give you
a $1 ,000 bonus on your lot.

94
00:18:18,183 --> 00:18:19,741
What kind of royalty are
you talking about?

95
00:18:19,851 --> 00:18:24,288
Onesixth, plus a guarantee to
start drilling within 10 days.

96
00:18:24,389 --> 00:18:27,620
Now, that's something you
won't find anywhere else.

97
00:18:36,535 --> 00:18:38,503
What age are your children,
ma'am?

98
00:18:38,637 --> 00:18:40,332
Ten and twelve.

99
00:18:41,473 --> 00:18:45,341
Mr. Plainview, a question,
sir. Where is your wife?

100
00:18:47,479 --> 00:18:50,312
She died in childbirth,
Mrs. Bankside.

101
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:53,714
So it's just me and my son now.

102
00:19:00,592 --> 00:19:02,457
lt's coming in, boss!

103
00:19:02,894 --> 00:19:04,191
Hear it?

104
00:19:30,488 --> 00:19:32,183
Mr. Plainview?

105
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:33,518
Yes?

106
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,853
Are you Daniel Plainview?

107
00:19:39,764 --> 00:19:40,890
Yes.

108
00:19:42,567 --> 00:19:44,535
What can l do for you?

109
00:19:46,371 --> 00:19:48,168
You look for oil.

110
00:19:49,407 --> 00:19:50,874
That's right.

111
00:19:51,009 --> 00:19:54,035
What do you pay for a place
that has it?

112
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:57,171
Well, that depends....
What does it depend on?

113
00:19:59,217 --> 00:20:01,048
On a lot of things.

114
00:20:01,987 --> 00:20:06,981
lf l told you l knew a place that had
oil where land could be bought cheaply,

115
00:20:07,092 --> 00:20:09,856
what do you think that
would be worth?

116
00:20:10,862 --> 00:20:15,094
l think that you should
let me know what you know

117
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,328
and then we'll try and work
something out.

118
00:20:20,372 --> 00:20:22,499
Can l sit down?...Please.

119
00:20:33,652 --> 00:20:35,950
What church do you belong to?

120
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,957
l...

121
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:48,622
l enjoy all faiths. l don't belong
to one church in particular.

122
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:52,760
l like them all. l like everything.
Where are you from?

123
00:20:52,871 --> 00:20:56,739
That would be telling you.
That's what l want to sell you.

124
00:20:59,311 --> 00:21:01,871
What are you doing in Signal Hill?

125
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,380
We have oil, and it seeps
through the ground.

126
00:21:04,482 --> 00:21:06,040
Do you want to pay me to know
where it is?

127
00:21:06,151 --> 00:21:07,209
Just 'cause there's something
on the ground

128
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:09,082
doesn't mean there's anything
beneath it.

129
00:21:09,187 --> 00:21:11,917
Why did Standard Oil buy
up land?

130
00:21:14,492 --> 00:21:16,357
ls it in California?

131
00:21:17,295 --> 00:21:20,423
Maybe....How much land did
they buy?

132
00:21:20,565 --> 00:21:23,966
l'd like it better if you didn't
think l was stupid.

133
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:34,742
Why did you come to me?

134
00:21:34,879 --> 00:21:39,179
You just brought this well in....
That's right.

135
00:21:39,284 --> 00:21:43,584
Yes, so just give me $500
in cash right now

136
00:21:43,722 --> 00:21:46,156
and l'll tell you where it is.

137
00:21:46,257 --> 00:21:48,521
l'll tell you what l'll do,
son. l'll give you $100 now,

138
00:21:48,626 --> 00:21:51,629
and if it proves to be a
promising lease

139
00:21:51,629 --> 00:21:53,256
then give you a $1 ,000 bonus.

140
00:21:53,398 --> 00:21:55,332
Six hundred dollars.

141
00:21:58,169 --> 00:22:01,036
Tell me one thing to help me decide.
What else have you got up there?

142
00:22:01,139 --> 00:22:02,834
What do you grow?

143
00:22:02,941 --> 00:22:06,672
We have a big ranch,
but it's mostly rocks.

144
00:22:06,778 --> 00:22:09,246
Plant things. Nothing will
grow but weeds.

145
00:22:09,381 --> 00:22:10,575
What makes you think it's up?

146
00:22:10,715 --> 00:22:13,775
ls there sulfur around?
Or alkali deposits?

147
00:22:13,918 --> 00:22:16,944
Alkali nearby.
l don't know sulfur.

148
00:22:23,528 --> 00:22:25,325
ls that your son?

149
00:22:25,764 --> 00:22:27,061
Yes.

150
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,662
Hi....Hi.

151
00:22:32,871 --> 00:22:35,704
Who are you?...
l'm Fletcher Hamilton.

152
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,808
Nice to meet you, son.
What's your name?

153
00:22:37,909 --> 00:22:39,536
What do you do?

154
00:22:40,545 --> 00:22:42,638
l work with Mr. Plainview.

155
00:22:43,348 --> 00:22:45,077
Here's $500, son.

156
00:22:45,216 --> 00:22:49,050
You tell me something worth
hearing, this money's yours.

157
00:22:53,024 --> 00:22:56,892
l come from a town called
Little Boston in lsabella County.

158
00:22:59,064 --> 00:23:03,501
This is us, here. Spur station
here at Little Boston.

159
00:23:03,601 --> 00:23:06,593
The Sunday ranch is
what you're looking for.

160
00:23:06,704 --> 00:23:08,934
There's a sheep trail that
takes you there.

161
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:12,009
lt's a mile out of town headed
west, not far.

162
00:23:12,143 --> 00:23:16,045
Just through a small pass
here near the base of the hills.

163
00:23:16,181 --> 00:23:18,206
You'll pass a church

164
00:23:18,206 --> 00:23:19,878
and just follow the sheep trail.

165
00:23:20,018 --> 00:23:21,847
Where's Standard buying up?

166
00:23:21,847 --> 00:23:24,148
Here and here.

167
00:23:26,324 --> 00:23:28,758
Your family name is Sunday,
yes?...That's right.

168
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,327
How many's in your family?

169
00:23:30,462 --> 00:23:33,659
My father and mother and
sisters and my brother Eli.

170
00:23:33,798 --> 00:23:36,460
How many sisters do you have?...
Two.

171
00:23:36,568 --> 00:23:38,900
What's your name?...Paul.

172
00:23:39,003 --> 00:23:42,234
Does any of your family know about
the oil that you say is there?

173
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,773
l don't know.

174
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:46,469
My uncle always said there
was oil there,

175
00:23:46,611 --> 00:23:48,300
but l don't know what they

176
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,079
heard or what they think.

177
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:50,613
What do you grow?

178
00:23:50,715 --> 00:23:53,738
lt's goats. lt's a goat farm.

179
00:23:53,738 --> 00:23:55,880
l told you, nothing grows
but weeds.

180
00:23:55,987 --> 00:23:58,478
ls there water?...lt's salty.

181
00:23:58,623 --> 00:24:01,990
You drill a well, it's hard
not to get saltwater.

182
00:24:03,862 --> 00:24:07,263
The oil is there. l'm telling you.

183
00:24:11,903 --> 00:24:13,300
l want to go now, so...

184
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,100
You can stay tonight.

185
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,847
No, l want to go now.
l want to leave.

186
00:24:16,847 --> 00:24:19,301
Listen, Paul.

187
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:25,946
lf l travel all the way out there and
l find that you've been lying to me,

188
00:24:26,084 --> 00:24:28,678
l'm going to find you and l'm going
to take more than my money back.

189
00:24:28,786 --> 00:24:31,016
ls that all right with you?

190
00:24:31,122 --> 00:24:33,352
Yes, sir....All right, then.

191
00:24:34,092 --> 00:24:38,222
Nice luck to you. God bless....
And to you, young man.

192
00:26:17,662 --> 00:26:19,653
There's someone coming....
Thank you, Mary.

193
00:26:29,407 --> 00:26:32,934
Good evening....Good evening.

194
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,745
My name's Daniel Plainview.
This is my son, H.W.

195
00:26:39,617 --> 00:26:42,381
Are you hunting?...Hunting
for quail.

196
00:26:42,487 --> 00:26:43,113
We're told there might be a
good place.

197
00:26:43,113 --> 00:26:45,354
to camp up near
the Sunday ranch.

198
00:26:45,456 --> 00:26:47,287
This is the Sunday ranch.
You can camp here.

199
00:26:47,425 --> 00:26:50,121
Thank you. Do you have water?...
Yes.

200
00:26:51,129 --> 00:26:53,120
We heard there was an earthquake
up here a few days ago.

201
00:26:53,264 --> 00:26:55,095
ls that right?...Yes.

202
00:26:55,967 --> 00:26:59,630
Your family?...Yeah, all fine.
Thank you.

203
00:27:01,272 --> 00:27:04,708
We have goat's milk, if you'd
like....That would be fine.

204
00:27:06,744 --> 00:27:07,711
Now,

205
00:27:09,614 --> 00:27:11,738
if we set our tent away
over there

206
00:27:11,738 --> 00:27:13,675
we'd be out of your way
over there.

207
00:27:13,785 --> 00:27:15,047
That's fine.

208
00:27:15,153 --> 00:27:17,348
Ruth! Help these men and
bring them some water.

209
00:27:17,455 --> 00:27:18,888
No! H.W.

210
00:27:20,792 --> 00:27:24,250
Mr. Plainview, would you
like that milk now?

211
00:27:24,395 --> 00:27:25,753
That would be fine. Thank you.

212
00:27:25,753 --> 00:27:28,456
Mary! Bring them some milk.

213
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:30,032
My family will help you
set up your tent.

214
00:27:30,134 --> 00:27:32,364
No, please. We set ourselves
on this camping trip.

215
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:34,131
We have to do the camping.

216
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:35,637
Hurry up!

217
00:27:38,609 --> 00:27:42,602
Do you have bread?...
We have potatoes.

218
00:27:42,747 --> 00:27:44,374
Potatoes would be nice,
thank you.

219
00:27:44,482 --> 00:27:45,949
l'll have them boil you up
some potatoes.

220
00:27:46,084 --> 00:27:48,382
That's all right. l thought
maybe we'd make a fire.

221
00:27:48,486 --> 00:27:50,716
l wanted to work with my son
on making a fire.

222
00:27:50,822 --> 00:27:52,756
All right. My son, Eli,
will bring you some wood.

223
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:54,915
Thank you so much for your
hospitality, Mr. Sunday.

224
00:27:55,059 --> 00:27:57,084
Yes....And we'll be out
of your way.

225
00:27:57,195 --> 00:27:59,925
We're just hunting for quail....
Yes.

226
00:28:01,899 --> 00:28:04,060
l'm sorry we don't have
any bread....No, no, no.

227
00:28:04,168 --> 00:28:06,966
Corn doesn't fill out in the
hills here. lt's mostly rock.

228
00:28:07,105 --> 00:28:09,903
We don't have room to
raise the grain.

229
00:28:13,644 --> 00:28:15,703
Thank you, young lady.

230
00:28:40,938 --> 00:28:42,565
My name is Eli.

231
00:28:43,908 --> 00:28:45,876
Yes, you're Eli Sunday.

232
00:28:46,878 --> 00:28:48,277
Welcome.

233
00:28:51,983 --> 00:28:53,678
H.W....Eli.

234
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:02,084
You're hunting quail?...
That's right.

235
00:29:06,364 --> 00:29:08,175
We will bring dinner.

236
00:29:08,175 --> 00:29:10,858
Thank you. Thank you so much.

237
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:34,144
Dad!

238
00:30:34,852 --> 00:30:36,581
Dad, look at my shoe.

239
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,708
That's earthquake oil.
Set loose.

240
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,537
So...

241
00:31:32,143 --> 00:31:33,337
So?

242
00:31:34,211 --> 00:31:35,576
So, so.

243
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:39,679
lf there's anything here,
we take it to the sea.

244
00:31:40,818 --> 00:31:42,362
What we do is we build a pipeline

245
00:31:42,362 --> 00:31:44,549
to Port Hueneme or Santa Paula,

246
00:31:44,655 --> 00:31:46,179
it's about 100 miles,

247
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:48,003
and we do a deal with Union Oil

248
00:31:48,003 --> 00:31:50,192
This is what we do.

249
00:31:50,728 --> 00:31:53,697
Then we don't need the railroads
and their shipping costs anymore.

250
00:31:53,798 --> 00:31:55,197
You see?

251
00:31:58,035 --> 00:31:59,059
Yeah.

252
00:31:59,203 --> 00:32:01,806
You see that?...Yeah.

253
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:05,170
Then we're making money.
We're making the real money.

254
00:32:05,276 --> 00:32:07,107
What we should be making.
Not just...

255
00:32:07,244 --> 00:32:09,610
Not just throwing it away
on shipping costs.

256
00:32:09,747 --> 00:32:11,874
Otherwise, it's just mud.

257
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,680
How much are we going to pay them?

258
00:32:19,557 --> 00:32:21,047
Who's that?

259
00:32:23,761 --> 00:32:25,558
The Sunday family.

260
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:28,997
l'm not going to give them oil prices.

261
00:32:31,569 --> 00:32:33,833
l'll give them quail prices.

262
00:32:39,577 --> 00:32:41,204
lf we could take a few minutes,

263
00:32:41,312 --> 00:32:44,440
there's something l'd very
much like to talk with you about.

264
00:32:44,582 --> 00:32:47,915
Mother, would you take the
girls outside, please?

265
00:33:00,131 --> 00:33:02,895
l believe in plain speaking, so...

266
00:33:03,034 --> 00:33:06,697
This is a beautiful ranch.
l love hunting for quail.

267
00:33:07,571 --> 00:33:08,815
My boy has been sick, you know.

268
00:33:08,815 --> 00:33:10,631
He needs fresh air.

269
00:33:10,741 --> 00:33:13,972
Doctors all say he needs
plentiful fresh air.

270
00:33:15,813 --> 00:33:16,780
So,

271
00:33:19,383 --> 00:33:23,342
what would you say would be a
fair price for this lot, Abel?

272
00:33:24,488 --> 00:33:27,048
To buy this place?...That's right.

273
00:33:32,063 --> 00:33:33,860
Take a moment.

274
00:33:37,735 --> 00:33:41,466
l'm sorry. l don't know....
Six dollars an acre.

275
00:33:41,572 --> 00:33:45,008
Six dollars? Thank you, Eli.

276
00:33:45,142 --> 00:33:48,839
And then with the improvements to
the ranch over the years at $500...

277
00:33:48,979 --> 00:33:51,504
l'd like to offer you $3,700
for this ranch.

278
00:33:51,649 --> 00:33:54,209
That's $3,700....No.

279
00:33:55,152 --> 00:33:57,450
The Lord has sent this man
here, Eli.

280
00:33:57,555 --> 00:33:59,045
Yes, l believe He has.

281
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:01,003
My offer to you is $3,700.

282
00:34:01,003 --> 00:34:03,251
What is it that brought
you here, sir?

283
00:34:04,462 --> 00:34:06,123
The Good Lord's guidance.

284
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:06,895
Now, of course, within that...

285
00:34:06,895 --> 00:34:07,561
What about our oil?

286
00:34:07,665 --> 00:34:09,326
...we're going to develop a lease.

287
00:34:10,634 --> 00:34:14,126
What's that?...What about our oil?

288
00:34:15,539 --> 00:34:16,972
What about it?

289
00:34:17,074 --> 00:34:19,269
We have oil here.
That's worth something.

290
00:34:19,376 --> 00:34:21,810
Do you have someone who can
drill for it?

291
00:34:21,912 --> 00:34:23,846
Do you think there's oil here?...
l know there is.

292
00:34:23,981 --> 00:34:26,006
lt's very expensive to drill.

293
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:28,311
To get it up and out of the ground.
You ever tried that before?

294
00:34:28,419 --> 00:34:30,478
How much is it?...Costly.

295
00:34:30,588 --> 00:34:33,648
Well, our oil sits right up
on top of the ground.

296
00:34:34,692 --> 00:34:36,421
l believe that's called seepage.

297
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,050
Doesn't necessarily mean
there's anything underneath.

298
00:34:38,195 --> 00:34:40,356
What would you give us for it?...
l don't know.

299
00:34:40,464 --> 00:34:43,399
Something you don't know....
That's right.

300
00:34:46,704 --> 00:34:48,672
What would you like, Eli?

301
00:34:50,407 --> 00:34:52,705
Ten thousand dollars.

302
00:34:54,912 --> 00:34:56,379
For what?

303
00:34:58,349 --> 00:35:00,044
For my church.

304
00:35:09,994 --> 00:35:11,484
That's good.

305
00:35:14,498 --> 00:35:16,295
That's a good one.

306
00:35:17,968 --> 00:35:18,935
Well...

307
00:35:20,204 --> 00:35:23,799
lf we decide to drill for oil
and if the well begins to produce,

308
00:35:23,908 --> 00:35:25,603
l'll give your church a
$5,000 signing bonus.

309
00:35:25,709 --> 00:35:26,676
Ten thousand.

310
00:35:26,777 --> 00:35:29,268
Do you want to find someone else that's
going to come here and drill, Eli?

311
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:32,474
Make the investment and do all
the hard work that goes into it?

312
00:35:32,616 --> 00:35:36,484
l can just as easily hunt for quail
on another ranch as l can here, so...

313
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:41,250
Though l'll happily be a supporter
of your church for as long as l can.

314
00:35:41,358 --> 00:35:43,155
For the bonus only.

315
00:35:44,962 --> 00:35:48,762
Now, as it happens, l do have some
connections in the drilling business

316
00:35:48,866 --> 00:35:53,428
who might help get us started.
How do you feel about this, Abel?

317
00:35:53,537 --> 00:35:55,437
Yes. What Eli says.

318
00:35:55,573 --> 00:35:58,736
Well, good! Let's draw up some
contracts and let's...

319
00:35:58,843 --> 00:36:00,743
Let's give it a try.

320
00:36:02,112 --> 00:36:04,945
Appreciate your help with this, Eli.

321
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,887
Good afternoon....Good afternoon.

322
00:36:17,995 --> 00:36:19,292
Real estate?...Yes.

323
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:21,421
Yes, l'd like to talk to you.

324
00:36:21,565 --> 00:36:26,059
l'm looking for some land.
l just bought the Sunday ranch.

325
00:36:26,203 --> 00:36:30,230
And, well, where's the map?

326
00:36:30,808 --> 00:36:33,242
Where are the hills behind
the Sunday ranch?

327
00:36:33,377 --> 00:36:37,040
That's here. lt's the Bandy
tract. He has over 600 acres.

328
00:36:37,147 --> 00:36:41,208
Bandy, 600.

329
00:36:41,352 --> 00:36:42,878
What about this?

330
00:36:42,878 --> 00:36:47,814
A.C. Maude, Blodget,
Redlick, Carr.

331
00:36:49,526 --> 00:36:52,518
What's it held at?...
Six dollars an acre.

332
00:36:53,264 --> 00:36:54,561
Six.

333
00:36:54,698 --> 00:36:56,325
What about this?

334
00:36:56,433 --> 00:37:00,028
That's the Belvins, and that
could be got, l'm sure.

335
00:37:01,939 --> 00:37:04,635
Can everything around here be got?

336
00:37:05,409 --> 00:37:06,876
Sure.

337
00:37:31,201 --> 00:37:34,659
Paul Sunday turned out to be
a good friend of ours.

338
00:37:35,372 --> 00:37:36,964
That's right.

339
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:43,303
Well, you get here just as soon
as you can. Bring Fred English.

340
00:37:44,682 --> 00:37:46,115
Good enough.

341
00:37:46,784 --> 00:37:48,513
Thank you, porter.

342
00:37:51,121 --> 00:37:53,749
H.W., how are you?...Fine, and you?

343
00:37:53,857 --> 00:37:55,757
Pretty good. Where's your dad?...He's inside.

344
00:37:55,859 --> 00:37:57,258
You fellas are a long way
from Signal Hill.

345
00:37:57,361 --> 00:37:59,329
Hello, Plainview....Hello, Gene.

346
00:37:59,463 --> 00:38:01,954
Good to see you....Charlie.

347
00:38:02,099 --> 00:38:06,627
On your way somewhere else?...
Passing through. Looking around.

348
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:09,261
Funny to see you....
Funny, isn't it?

349
00:38:09,406 --> 00:38:12,136
You boys are a regular
family business.

350
00:38:12,276 --> 00:38:13,937
You boys are a little late.

351
00:38:14,078 --> 00:38:18,105
What did you find?...l found
some interesting prospects.

352
00:38:18,248 --> 00:38:19,476
Did you hear Standard bought up?

353
00:38:19,616 --> 00:38:22,210
Mostly in the north, so far....
That's what l hear.

354
00:38:22,319 --> 00:38:25,755
l'm gonna tell you, Gene, if you're
gonna make a play, look east.

355
00:38:25,889 --> 00:38:27,988
l'd rather it be you than
someone else

356
00:38:27,988 --> 00:38:31,122
This mud around here has
been taken.

357
00:38:31,261 --> 00:38:33,410
lt must be easy when you
have such a cute face

358
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:34,788
to carry around with you.

359
00:38:34,932 --> 00:38:37,992
Telling me how handsome my
son is?...Well, that l am.

360
00:38:38,102 --> 00:38:41,265
That's very nice. Thank you.
Good luck, Gene.

361
00:38:41,405 --> 00:38:43,873
Take care....Like l said, go east.

362
00:38:43,974 --> 00:38:45,066
H.W.

363
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:48,772
l'll be your lawyer if you
need to draw up a contract.

364
00:38:48,912 --> 00:38:50,706
Make sure you don't get
swindled, boy.

365
00:38:50,706 --> 00:38:53,178
Get half what your dad's making.

366
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:05,052
How's that?

367
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:22,171
What are those men doing?

368
00:39:24,515 --> 00:39:27,040
They're just guys
that are working for us.

369
00:39:27,184 --> 00:39:29,482
They're just looking around.

370
00:39:31,688 --> 00:39:33,918
How much money can we make?

371
00:39:37,961 --> 00:39:40,327
l don't know. lt depends.

372
00:39:44,535 --> 00:39:46,628
One thousand dollars?

373
00:39:54,478 --> 00:39:58,244
Mary said that her father
beats her if she doesn't pray.

374
00:40:04,822 --> 00:40:07,256
Mary, she's the smaller one?

375
00:40:09,927 --> 00:40:11,451
Yes, she is.

376
00:40:25,242 --> 00:40:27,767
Everyone here?...Very successful.

377
00:40:28,545 --> 00:40:29,569
But?

378
00:40:29,713 --> 00:40:33,080
There were a few vacant
lots and one holdout.

379
00:40:33,217 --> 00:40:34,844
Who?...William Bandy.

380
00:40:34,952 --> 00:40:37,011
...eight. Who's he?

381
00:40:37,121 --> 00:40:38,520
He's an old man who
homesteaded here.

382
00:40:38,622 --> 00:40:41,750
Lives with his grandson. He
said he'd like to speak with you.

383
00:40:41,892 --> 00:40:43,052
ls he here?

384
00:40:43,193 --> 00:40:46,219
No, he'd like you to come
visit with him.

385
00:40:46,363 --> 00:40:48,058
He's boosting his price.

386
00:40:48,198 --> 00:40:51,998
He said he'd like to speak with
whoever is doing the buying.

387
00:40:52,102 --> 00:40:55,367
Well, let him wait. He'll
come around. Let's go.

388
00:41:02,446 --> 00:41:04,380
Ladies and gentlemen?

389
00:41:05,382 --> 00:41:07,407
Ladies and gentlemen.

390
00:41:07,551 --> 00:41:10,918
Thank you so much for visiting
with us this evening.

391
00:41:11,054 --> 00:41:14,615
Now, l've traveled across half our state
to be here and to see about this land.

392
00:41:17,694 --> 00:41:18,675
Now, l daresay some of you

393
00:41:18,675 --> 00:41:19,184
might have heard

394
00:41:19,329 --> 00:41:23,163
some of the more extravagant
rumors about what my plans are,

395
00:41:23,267 --> 00:41:26,031
so l just thought you'd like
to hear it from me.

396
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:29,037
This is the face.
lt's no great mystery.

397
00:41:31,909 --> 00:41:35,868
l'm an oilman, ladies and gentlemen,

398
00:41:36,747 --> 00:41:40,148
l have numerous concerns
spread across this state.

399
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:43,651
l have many wells flowing at
many thousand barrels per day,

400
00:41:43,754 --> 00:41:46,723
so l like to think of
myself as an oilman.

401
00:41:47,724 --> 00:41:49,521
As an oilman, l hope that
you'll forgive

402
00:41:49,626 --> 00:41:52,527
just good oldfashioned plain
speaking.

403
00:41:54,164 --> 00:41:57,691
Now, this work that we do is
very much a family enterprise.

404
00:41:57,834 --> 00:42:00,496
l work side by side with my
wonderful son, H. W.

405
00:42:00,604 --> 00:42:03,835
l think one or two of you
might have met him already.

406
00:42:03,941 --> 00:42:05,144
And l encourage my men

407
00:42:05,144 --> 00:42:07,707
to bring their families, as well.

408
00:42:07,844 --> 00:42:11,803
Of course, it makes for an ever
so much more rewarding life for them.

409
00:42:11,915 --> 00:42:15,874
Family means children, and
children means education.

410
00:42:16,019 --> 00:42:19,682
So, wherever we set up camp,
education is a necessity,

411
00:42:19,823 --> 00:42:22,018
and we're just so happy to
take care of that.

412
00:42:22,159 --> 00:42:24,525
So let's build a wonderful
school in Little Boston.

413
00:42:24,661 --> 00:42:26,856
These children are the future
that we strive for,

414
00:42:26,997 --> 00:42:30,091
and so they should have the
very best of things.

415
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,191
Now, something else,

416
00:42:32,336 --> 00:42:36,170
and please don't be insulted
if l speak about this. Bread.

417
00:42:36,306 --> 00:42:38,274
Let's talk about bread.

418
00:42:38,976 --> 00:42:42,309
Now, to my mind, it's an
abomination to consider

419
00:42:42,446 --> 00:42:46,644
that any man, woman, or child
in this magnificent country of ours

420
00:42:46,783 --> 00:42:50,241
should have to look upon a
loaf of bread as a luxury.

421
00:42:51,054 --> 00:42:54,615
We're going to dig water wells here,
and water wells means irrigation.

422
00:42:54,758 --> 00:42:57,124
lrrigation means cultivation.

423
00:42:57,261 --> 00:43:01,129
We're going to raise crops here where
before it just simply wasn't possible.

424
00:43:01,265 --> 00:43:03,665
You're going to have more grain
than you'll know what to do with,

425
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:06,735
and bread will be coming right
out of your ears, ma'am.

426
00:43:06,837 --> 00:43:12,139
New roads, agriculture,
employment, education.

427
00:43:12,276 --> 00:43:14,244
These are just a few of the
things we can offer you,

428
00:43:14,344 --> 00:43:16,312
and l assure you,
ladies and gentlemen,

429
00:43:16,446 --> 00:43:18,607
that if we do find oil here,

430
00:43:18,749 --> 00:43:22,150
and l think there's a very
good chance that we will,

431
00:43:22,286 --> 00:43:25,769
this community of yours
will not only survive

432
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:26,780
it will flourish.

433
00:43:29,026 --> 00:43:32,052
l'd be happy to answer any questions
that you might have. Yes?

434
00:43:32,162 --> 00:43:34,687
Will the new road lead
to the church?

435
00:43:34,798 --> 00:43:39,235
That'll be the first place that it
leads. Thank you, Eli. Anyone else?

436
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:42,201
Well, if anything comes up,
l'm pretty easy to find.

437
00:43:42,306 --> 00:43:43,568
You just come visit with me.

438
00:43:43,674 --> 00:43:45,699
Thank you so much for your time,
and good night.

439
00:44:24,247 --> 00:44:29,207
What a privilege to carry

440
00:44:29,353 --> 00:44:33,221
everything to God in prayer!

441
00:44:34,191 --> 00:44:37,752
What a privilege to carry...

442
00:44:55,112 --> 00:44:56,977
Just follow the new road right
to the church.

443
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:59,310
The new road will lead you there.

444
00:44:59,416 --> 00:45:01,077
Hello, brother, my name is Eli.

445
00:45:01,218 --> 00:45:04,745
The Church of the
Third Revelation welcomes you.

446
00:45:04,888 --> 00:45:06,583
Hello, brother, my name is Eli.

447
00:45:06,723 --> 00:45:09,021
The Church of the
Third Revelation welcomes you.

448
00:45:09,159 --> 00:45:12,185
Just follow the new road
right to the church.

449
00:45:21,037 --> 00:45:24,598
Jesus knows our every weakness

450
00:45:26,443 --> 00:45:29,378
Take it to the Lord in prayer

451
00:45:30,614 --> 00:45:34,778
Are we weak and heavyladen

452
00:45:35,819 --> 00:45:38,811
Cumbered with a load of care?

453
00:45:40,056 --> 00:45:43,150
Precious Savior still our refuge

454
00:45:45,195 --> 00:45:47,789
Take it to the Lord in prayer...

455
00:45:59,810 --> 00:46:02,870
Daniel, may l speak with you?...
Yes, come in.

456
00:46:05,015 --> 00:46:07,984
l'll bring them up when
they arrive.

457
00:46:08,118 --> 00:46:10,313
Good morning....Good morning.

458
00:46:10,454 --> 00:46:12,354
How is all the work coming?

459
00:46:12,489 --> 00:46:13,922
Everything's good.

460
00:46:14,024 --> 00:46:17,152
All the men are provided for?...
Of course.

461
00:46:19,229 --> 00:46:21,094
Spirits seem high.

462
00:46:23,567 --> 00:46:27,003
ls there anything that you
need from me?

463
00:46:30,106 --> 00:46:32,675
Anything the church can do for you?

464
00:46:32,675 --> 00:46:34,338
l don't believe so. No. Thank you.

465
00:46:34,478 --> 00:46:36,810
l understand you've asked
the people to gather around

466
00:46:36,947 --> 00:46:38,539
and watch the well begin
tomorrow. ls that right?

467
00:46:38,648 --> 00:46:40,616
That's right....
l will bless the well.

468
00:46:42,385 --> 00:46:45,081
Before you begin,
you should introduce me.

469
00:46:45,188 --> 00:46:47,748
You'll see me walk up towards
the oil well, and when l...

470
00:46:47,858 --> 00:46:48,916
The derrick.

471
00:46:49,025 --> 00:46:52,825
You'll see me walk up, and
then you could say my name.

472
00:46:52,963 --> 00:46:55,090
When you walk up?

473
00:46:55,198 --> 00:46:59,100
Yes. You'll see me walk up,
and then you could say,

474
00:46:59,202 --> 00:47:01,238
''The proud son of these hills

475
00:47:01,238 --> 00:47:04,333
who tended his Father's flock,''

476
00:47:04,574 --> 00:47:06,974
and then you could say my name.

477
00:47:08,278 --> 00:47:09,836
That's fine.

478
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:12,081
And what happens then?

479
00:47:12,081 --> 00:47:14,248
Well, then we start the drill.

480
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:21,049
lt's a simple blessing, Daniel,
but an important one.

481
00:47:21,191 --> 00:47:24,160
lt's just a few words.
lt won't take long.

482
00:47:25,262 --> 00:47:28,356
What time?...What time's
good for you, Eli?

483
00:47:28,498 --> 00:47:31,296
4:00....Well,
let's make it 4:00 then.

484
00:47:32,402 --> 00:47:36,133
My thanks for your visit....
Good day. Thank you.

485
00:47:51,555 --> 00:47:53,523
Afternoon, everyone.

486
00:47:54,858 --> 00:47:56,450
Come with me.

487
00:48:01,865 --> 00:48:05,323
l thank you all so much for
visiting with us at this time.

488
00:48:05,468 --> 00:48:07,265
l've had the pleasure of
meeting some of you

489
00:48:07,370 --> 00:48:09,201
and l hope very much in the
months to come,

490
00:48:09,339 --> 00:48:12,502
l'll be able to visit with
each and every one of you.

491
00:48:12,642 --> 00:48:15,304
l'm better at digging holes in
the ground than making speeches,

492
00:48:15,445 --> 00:48:16,969
so let's forget the speech
for this evening,

493
00:48:17,113 --> 00:48:19,013
just make it a simple blessing.

494
00:48:19,149 --> 00:48:20,912
You see, one man doesn't
prospect from the ground.

495
00:48:21,017 --> 00:48:24,953
lt takes a whole community of
good people, such as yourselves,

496
00:48:25,055 --> 00:48:28,047
and this is good. We stay together.

497
00:48:28,158 --> 00:48:29,921
We pray together, we work together,

498
00:48:30,026 --> 00:48:32,995
and if the Good Lord smiles
kindly on our endeavor,

499
00:48:33,129 --> 00:48:35,597
we share in the wealth together.

500
00:48:38,034 --> 00:48:40,093
Now, before we spud in Mary's
Well Number One,

501
00:48:40,203 --> 00:48:43,366
named for the lovely Miss Mary
Sunday, here by my side,

502
00:48:43,473 --> 00:48:46,465
a proud daughter of these hills,

503
00:48:46,610 --> 00:48:50,307
l'd just like to say God bless these
honest labors of ours, and, of course,

504
00:48:50,447 --> 00:48:52,472
God bless you all.

505
00:48:52,616 --> 00:48:53,708
Amen.

506
00:48:53,817 --> 00:48:55,114
Now go.

507
00:49:00,090 --> 00:49:01,853
Won't be a minute.

508
00:49:04,928 --> 00:49:06,896
Fast as you can, H.W.

509
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,527
Are you ready to do this?

510
00:49:22,379 --> 00:49:24,847
That's it, ladies and gentlemen!

511
00:49:28,752 --> 00:49:32,848
Al Rose has very generously provided
some refreshments for this occasion

512
00:49:32,956 --> 00:49:35,686
out of his own pocket. Thank you, Al.

513
00:49:36,426 --> 00:49:40,863
lf you'll all just care to help
yourselves, l'll be back in a minute.

514
00:50:53,837 --> 00:50:55,361
Mary.

515
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,667
Mary Sunday.

516
00:51:01,511 --> 00:51:04,241
Do you like your new dress?...
Yes. Thank you.

517
00:51:04,347 --> 00:51:07,248
You're welcome. l thought
you'd like it.

518
00:51:08,118 --> 00:51:10,643
Are you happy l came here?...Yes.

519
00:51:12,355 --> 00:51:16,052
Your daddy doesn't hit you anymore,
does he? Does he now?

520
00:51:16,926 --> 00:51:18,791
Better not, right?

521
00:51:19,462 --> 00:51:21,453
l'll take care of you.

522
00:51:22,565 --> 00:51:27,696
No more hitting, right?
No more hitting. Now go.

523
00:51:27,837 --> 00:51:30,863
Go and play some more and
don't come back.

524
00:51:40,016 --> 00:51:41,449
Daniel?

525
00:51:45,121 --> 00:51:49,285
lt's okay, H.W. Go back to sleep.
Go on. Go back to sleep.

526
00:51:51,828 --> 00:51:52,988
Daniel.

527
00:51:55,398 --> 00:51:56,592
Daniel.

528
00:51:59,536 --> 00:52:00,798
Daniel!

529
00:52:02,372 --> 00:52:03,566
Daniel!

530
00:52:03,673 --> 00:52:04,935
What?

531
00:52:06,810 --> 00:52:08,903
Lost a man down the well.

532
00:52:13,449 --> 00:52:15,576
What man?...Joe Gundha.

533
00:52:17,587 --> 00:52:19,646
Did l know him?...No.

534
00:52:20,156 --> 00:52:21,214
What happened?

535
00:52:28,898 --> 00:52:30,297
Pick it up.

536
00:52:30,967 --> 00:52:32,559
Set the brake.

537
00:52:32,669 --> 00:52:34,967
Tie it down....Tie it on.

538
00:52:39,576 --> 00:52:40,907
Shit!

539
00:52:42,979 --> 00:52:45,777
God damn it. Where's the body?

540
00:52:46,115 --> 00:52:49,107
They're fishing it out now....
All right.

541
00:52:52,488 --> 00:52:55,116
Where's the bit?...
lt's on the deck.

542
00:53:38,668 --> 00:53:41,501
Clean him up.
Put some clothes on him.

543
00:53:42,639 --> 00:53:43,901
And...

544
00:53:45,541 --> 00:53:47,099
Set up a tent.

545
00:53:47,210 --> 00:53:51,169
Anyone goes down into the cellar,
you tell somebody. Yes?

546
00:53:51,814 --> 00:53:53,213
Yes, sir....Yes, sir.

547
00:53:57,153 --> 00:53:59,178
Shut down till midday.

548
00:54:30,486 --> 00:54:33,019
And l had a vision.

549
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:35,890
Yes, last night, l had a vision

550
00:54:35,992 --> 00:54:38,893
and l felt God's breath move
through me.

551
00:54:42,532 --> 00:54:46,628
And it rolled down into
my stomach.

552
00:54:48,638 --> 00:54:50,503
lt sloshed around.

553
00:54:51,908 --> 00:54:55,776
And my stomach spoke in a
whisper, not a shout,

554
00:54:59,015 --> 00:55:03,213
''Touch this woman with your
hands and caress her.'' Yes.

555
00:55:07,590 --> 00:55:09,751
My dear Mrs. Hunter,

556
00:55:10,927 --> 00:55:13,259
you have arthritis, don't you?

557
00:55:13,396 --> 00:55:15,387
Yes, l do, Eli....Yes.

558
00:55:15,498 --> 00:55:19,093
The devil is in your hands,
and l will suck it out.

559
00:55:20,269 --> 00:55:24,729
Now, l will not cast this
ghost out with a fever

560
00:55:24,874 --> 00:55:29,902
for the new spirit inside me has shown
me l have a new way to communicate.

561
00:55:32,382 --> 00:55:34,407
lt is a gentle whisper.

562
00:55:40,790 --> 00:55:43,156
Get out of here, ghost.

563
00:55:45,728 --> 00:55:48,060
Get out of here, ghost.

564
00:55:50,099 --> 00:55:51,532
Get out.

565
00:55:52,135 --> 00:55:55,036
Get out of here, ghost.

566
00:55:57,407 --> 00:56:00,570
Get out of here, ghost.

567
00:56:00,710 --> 00:56:02,661
...and enter this woman's body now.

568
00:56:02,661 --> 00:56:04,612
Get out of here, ghost.

569
00:56:04,714 --> 00:56:09,549
Get out of here. Don't you dare
turn around and come back.

570
00:56:10,753 --> 00:56:12,448
For if you do,

571
00:56:12,555 --> 00:56:18,050
all the armies of my boot
will kick you in the teeth

572
00:56:18,194 --> 00:56:21,686
and you will be cast up and
thrown in the dirt

573
00:56:21,831 --> 00:56:24,197
and thrust back to perdition!

574
00:56:24,333 --> 00:56:28,030
And as long as l have teeth,
l will bite you,

575
00:56:28,171 --> 00:56:32,130
and if l have no teeth,
l will gum you!

576
00:56:32,241 --> 00:56:35,972
And as long as l have fists,
l will bash you!

577
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:40,812
Now, get out of here, ghost!
Get out of here, ghost!

578
00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:43,976
Get out of here, ghost!

579
00:56:47,156 --> 00:56:48,748
And it left!

580
00:56:49,525 --> 00:56:51,516
Hallelujah!...Hallelujah!

581
00:56:53,062 --> 00:56:55,496
Praise the Lord and his holy
days!...Praise God!

582
00:56:55,631 --> 00:56:59,067
Amen! Thank you....Thank you,
Jesus. Thank you, God.

583
00:57:00,336 --> 00:57:02,497
My dear Mrs. Hunter.

584
00:57:06,109 --> 00:57:07,838
Dance with me.

585
00:57:15,084 --> 00:57:17,416
Thanks for coming....
lt was a wonderful sermon.

586
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,920
Will l see you tomorrow?...Yes.

587
00:57:24,927 --> 00:57:25,894
Eli.

588
00:57:28,464 --> 00:57:31,262
Had a tragedy at
the well last night.

589
00:57:32,502 --> 00:57:34,197
Yes, l heard.

590
00:57:34,303 --> 00:57:36,703
Joe Gundha was a man of
considerable faith.

591
00:57:36,806 --> 00:57:41,038
So if you wish to say a few words,
his burial is at noon tomorrow.

592
00:57:41,144 --> 00:57:43,977
Daniel, this accident could
have been avoided.

593
00:57:44,113 --> 00:57:46,206
lt is terrible to think of
that well

594
00:57:46,315 --> 00:57:46,675
working away out there...

595
00:57:46,675 --> 00:57:48,180
These men work in 12hour shifts.

596
00:57:48,284 --> 00:57:49,273
unblessed....They need their rest.

597
00:57:49,418 --> 00:57:49,878
lf they don't have it, they
start to make stupid mistakes.

598
00:57:49,878 --> 00:57:51,862
l've seen the men drinking

599
00:57:51,862 --> 00:57:53,237
Don't you think that has
something to do with this?

600
00:57:53,237 --> 00:57:55,590
We need these men wellrested
to bring in this well.

601
00:57:55,725 --> 00:57:57,886
They can't get that if they're
up here listening to your gospel,

602
00:57:57,994 --> 00:58:00,121
and then the well can't produce
and blow gold all over the place.

603
00:58:00,263 --> 00:58:02,231
l wish l had more time with
Joe Gundha.

604
00:58:02,365 --> 00:58:03,559
More could have been done.

605
00:58:03,699 --> 00:58:08,693
Then the well can't produce and
blow gold all over the place.

606
00:58:15,044 --> 00:58:17,342
Now, would you see to it that
his personal possessions

607
00:58:17,446 --> 00:58:19,573
find their way back to his
family, please?

608
00:58:19,715 --> 00:58:21,182
Thank you.

609
00:58:21,717 --> 00:58:24,845
Heard you were planning
some renovations.

610
00:58:24,954 --> 00:58:27,923
Yes, our congregation is
growing strongly.

611
00:58:28,591 --> 00:58:29,925
We need more room.

612
00:58:29,925 --> 00:58:33,051
That was one goddamn hell
of a show.

613
00:58:34,197 --> 00:58:36,722
We were happy to have you,
Daniel.

614
01:00:30,346 --> 01:00:32,075
Gas, gas, gas!

615
01:00:41,157 --> 01:00:44,251
Lights out! Wait here.
Wait here. Lights out!

616
01:00:54,403 --> 01:00:56,200
Put that fire out!

617
01:01:23,065 --> 01:01:26,831
ls he hurt? H.W.!
Hand him down to me!

618
01:01:31,407 --> 01:01:33,637
Hand him down!...Here.

619
01:01:37,780 --> 01:01:39,873
Got him?...l've got him!

620
01:01:47,189 --> 01:01:48,554
Oh, God.

621
01:02:03,973 --> 01:02:05,372
Come on.

622
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:19,078
Open the door.

623
01:02:33,903 --> 01:02:36,633
Let go. There you go.
You're safe. You're safe.

624
01:02:37,606 --> 01:02:41,440
You're safe now. l got you here.
You're safe. Let go, son.

625
01:02:42,812 --> 01:02:45,679
Tell me where it hurts. Tell me
where it hurts. Tell me where...

626
01:02:45,815 --> 01:02:47,282
Did you see this?...No.

627
01:02:47,383 --> 01:02:48,441
Tell me where it hurts.

628
01:02:48,551 --> 01:02:51,111
Where does it hurt you?
Where does it hurt you?

629
01:02:51,220 --> 01:02:52,628
l can't hear my voice.

630
01:02:52,628 --> 01:02:54,883
Were you hit in the head?

631
01:02:55,591 --> 01:03:00,119
Were you hit in the head? Tell me!
You have to tell me if you were!

632
01:03:00,229 --> 01:03:02,254
l can't hear my voice.

633
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:13,970
l have to go and deal with this
now. You wait here for me.

634
01:03:14,076 --> 01:03:15,488
You understand?
You wait here for me.

635
01:03:15,488 --> 01:03:17,910
l'll be back.
l'll be back in a minute.

636
01:03:18,013 --> 01:03:19,173
Wait here....Don't leave!

637
01:03:19,315 --> 01:03:22,003
l'm going to take care of you.
Wait.

638
01:03:22,003 --> 01:03:23,752
Stay here, son.
l'm going to fix this.

639
01:03:23,853 --> 01:03:24,751
Don't leave!...
You're going to be fine!

640
01:03:24,854 --> 01:03:25,843
Wait for me here!

641
01:03:25,955 --> 01:03:28,947
Hold him down. Hold him down....
Don't leave!

642
01:03:31,193 --> 01:03:33,821
Got to break the cables, Daniel!

643
01:03:33,963 --> 01:03:35,828
Get me a hammer!

644
01:03:42,137 --> 01:03:43,968
Get me a hammer!

645
01:03:46,542 --> 01:03:48,237
Here you go.

646
01:04:13,569 --> 01:04:14,900
Get back!

647
01:04:52,541 --> 01:04:53,838
Michael!...Sir!

648
01:04:53,943 --> 01:04:56,377
Take Dave and two of the fellas,
pick up some hoses...

649
01:04:56,478 --> 01:05:00,414
Billy, protect the roof. Don't
wait before it gets too hot.

650
01:05:22,805 --> 01:05:25,433
What are you looking so
miserable about?

651
01:05:25,574 --> 01:05:28,407
There's a whole ocean of oil
under our feet!

652
01:05:28,544 --> 01:05:31,206
No one can get at it
except for me.

653
01:06:17,926 --> 01:06:19,518
H.W. okay?

654
01:06:20,529 --> 01:06:22,087
No, he isn't.

655
01:06:24,366 --> 01:06:26,698
Where is he?...Mess room.

656
01:08:05,901 --> 01:08:09,530
That's enough now. That's enough,
H.W. That's enough.

657
01:08:12,207 --> 01:08:15,233
Do you hear me? Can you hear
me in there?

658
01:08:21,016 --> 01:08:22,711
That's enough.

659
01:08:35,063 --> 01:08:37,827
Grab his legs....l have his legs.

660
01:08:37,933 --> 01:08:39,833
No. Nope....No, lad.

661
01:08:45,507 --> 01:08:47,168
Give me that.

662
01:08:51,413 --> 01:08:52,471
Steady. That's it.

663
01:08:52,581 --> 01:08:54,981
Easy, boy. Easy....Soon be over.

664
01:08:55,083 --> 01:08:58,849
Yeah, and that's good. Now
the other side. Turn him over.

665
01:09:02,791 --> 01:09:03,758
Almost done.

666
01:09:07,296 --> 01:09:08,763
That's it.

667
01:09:09,631 --> 01:09:12,429
Come here. lt's over. lt's over.

668
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:20,500
Who do we know in San Francisco

669
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:24,500
or Los Angeles,
who could work with...

670
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:32,500
You know, we could... Someone,
a teacher for H.W.

671
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:38,500
How could you figure out that?

672
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:41,738
Now, call... God damn it

673
01:11:41,738 --> 01:11:43,113
God damn it, what's his name?

674
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:44,500
Bob Brody in San Francisco?

675
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:49,500
Call Bob Brody and get
someone down here.

676
01:11:56,500 --> 01:11:58,500
l'll do it right away.

677
01:13:06,190 --> 01:13:08,454
When do we get our money, Daniel?

678
01:13:14,498 --> 01:13:18,025
Aren't you a healer? And a
vessel for the Holy Spirit?

679
01:13:18,168 --> 01:13:21,160
When are you coming over
and make my son hear again?

680
01:13:21,305 --> 01:13:22,431
Can't you do that?

681
01:13:22,539 --> 01:13:24,507
lf you had let me bless the well,
his wouldn't have happened.

682
01:13:24,642 --> 01:13:27,440
Daniel....You shouldn't have
done that.

683
01:13:28,812 --> 01:13:33,112
You owe the Church of the
Third Revelation $5,000

684
01:13:33,217 --> 01:13:36,084
as part of the arrangement
that we made!

685
01:13:45,863 --> 01:13:50,664
Don't even try it, you little
runt! You splash around in here.

686
01:13:57,541 --> 01:13:59,441
That's it, that's it.

687
01:14:11,522 --> 01:14:14,184
l'm going to bury you underground,
Eli.

688
01:14:18,228 --> 01:14:20,822
l'm going to bury you underground.

689
01:14:52,396 --> 01:14:55,160
You are a stupid man, Abel.

690
01:14:57,001 --> 01:15:01,631
You've let someone come in
here and walk all over us.

691
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:08,267
You let him in and do his
work here,

692
01:15:08,379 --> 01:15:12,372
and you are a stupid man for
what we could have had.

693
01:15:12,516 --> 01:15:16,452
l followed His word, Eli. l tried.

694
01:15:16,553 --> 01:15:19,283
You didn't do anything but sit down.

695
01:15:20,657 --> 01:15:23,125
You're lazy, and you're stupid.

696
01:15:26,830 --> 01:15:30,960
Do you think God is going
to save you for being stupid?

697
01:15:33,637 --> 01:15:36,197
He doesn't save stupid people,
Abel.

698
01:15:39,576 --> 01:15:44,013
l will tear you apart for what
you've done, you stupid man!

699
01:15:44,148 --> 01:15:46,446
How did he come here?
Do you really know? l know!

700
01:15:46,550 --> 01:15:49,178
Son, don't do this, please!...
Be quiet!

701
01:15:49,319 --> 01:15:54,347
Shut your mouth, Abel!
lt was your stupid son!

702
01:15:54,491 --> 01:15:58,427
lt was Paul who told him to
come here. l know it.

703
01:15:58,529 --> 01:16:00,258
He went to him and he said,

704
01:16:00,364 --> 01:16:05,097
''My stupid, weak father
will give away his lots.

705
01:16:05,202 --> 01:16:08,660
''Go and take him.''
And you let it happen.

706
01:16:13,210 --> 01:16:16,338
A stupid father to a stupid son.

707
01:16:21,985 --> 01:16:23,646
Get out of there!

708
01:16:54,351 --> 01:16:55,978
Can l help you?

709
01:16:57,554 --> 01:16:59,078
Daniel?

710
01:16:59,189 --> 01:17:02,920
Who's that?...My name is Henry.

711
01:17:03,894 --> 01:17:05,293
Yeah?

712
01:17:06,463 --> 01:17:07,862
l'm Henry.

713
01:17:09,399 --> 01:17:11,424
What can l do for you?

714
01:17:14,304 --> 01:17:18,104
l'm Henry Plainview.
l'm from Fond du Lac.

715
01:17:20,644 --> 01:17:24,478
l'm your brother,
from another mother.

716
01:17:26,750 --> 01:17:28,650
Ernest is my father.

717
01:17:32,956 --> 01:17:34,480
Who are you?

718
01:17:35,859 --> 01:17:37,087
Henry.

719
01:18:04,154 --> 01:18:08,614
Mary Branch? ls that your mother?...
Yes, sir, that's right.

720
01:18:10,861 --> 01:18:16,026
l read about your gusher in
the paper, about your success.

721
01:18:16,166 --> 01:18:19,192
You heard about my strike?
You just show up?

722
01:18:20,237 --> 01:18:22,000
Our father's dead.

723
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:26,837
Ernest died, l heard.
l wanted to find you.

724
01:18:26,977 --> 01:18:28,604
When?

725
01:18:28,712 --> 01:18:32,307
Three months ago. l got a
letter from Annabelle.

726
01:18:33,317 --> 01:18:35,182
My sister, Annabelle?

727
01:18:37,187 --> 01:18:40,850
Where is she?...Still at home.
Fond du Lac.

728
01:18:42,593 --> 01:18:46,051
You came all the way from
Wisconsin to tell me this?

729
01:18:46,196 --> 01:18:49,222
l'm coming from New Mexico.
l've been there.

730
01:18:50,434 --> 01:18:52,299
l came to find you.

731
01:18:53,437 --> 01:18:55,496
Did you know about me?

732
01:19:03,614 --> 01:19:05,809
Do you have identification?

733
01:19:06,483 --> 01:19:08,576
Do you have this letter?

734
01:19:31,742 --> 01:19:33,801
Where are you coming from?...
From New Mexico.

735
01:19:33,910 --> 01:19:35,846
Yes, l know, but from where?

736
01:19:36,513 --> 01:19:39,539
Silver City. l've been there
for two years.

737
01:19:40,617 --> 01:19:45,418
l was trying drilling of my
own for years.

738
01:19:45,555 --> 01:19:51,960
Getting leases in Texas. Louisiana....
Anything that produced?

739
01:19:52,062 --> 01:19:55,054
No. Not like your success, no.

740
01:20:01,571 --> 01:20:04,005
Are you married?...No.

741
01:20:04,508 --> 01:20:08,501
l spent time in jail. l had
a stretch of very bad time.

742
01:20:09,179 --> 01:20:12,376
l had nothing. l was picked
up in Louisiana.

743
01:20:13,884 --> 01:20:17,513
l worked on a chain gang for
six months building roads.

744
01:20:18,055 --> 01:20:21,218
That was a very hard time.

745
01:20:22,220 --> 01:20:27,070
Are you married?

746
01:20:28,065 --> 01:20:30,499
What were you in jail for?

747
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:35,128
Believe it or not, for all the terrible
things l've gotten myself into,

748
01:20:35,238 --> 01:20:38,765
when they picked me up,
l hadn't done anything.

749
01:20:38,875 --> 01:20:42,675
But l've done my share of things

750
01:20:44,981 --> 01:20:47,381
that shouldn't be talked about.

751
01:21:09,873 --> 01:21:12,933
Drink it. Drink it!

752
01:21:55,519 --> 01:21:56,816
Come on.

753
01:22:28,485 --> 01:22:29,782
So...

754
01:22:34,591 --> 01:22:36,354
What do you want, Henry?

755
01:22:38,795 --> 01:22:40,194
Nothing.

756
01:22:43,333 --> 01:22:47,497
lf you can spare something, l
can work for you in any way.

757
01:22:47,637 --> 01:22:51,937
l know l'll keep moving, before
long, to get back to Fond du Lac.

758
01:22:52,976 --> 01:22:55,308
Do you have any money?...Some.

759
01:22:56,413 --> 01:22:58,574
Not much....Just answer me directly.

760
01:22:58,682 --> 01:23:02,277
You say ''nothing,'' then you say
you'd like to stay and work.

761
01:23:02,385 --> 01:23:07,322
And it's better, l'd just like to
hear you say you'd like to be here.

762
01:23:08,458 --> 01:23:10,358
l'd like to be here.

763
01:23:15,699 --> 01:23:21,296
l'm a good worker. l worked cable
tool rigs, built railroads.

764
01:23:23,473 --> 01:23:25,498
l won't need any favors.

765
01:23:30,514 --> 01:23:31,640
Good.

766
01:23:57,507 --> 01:23:59,668
What did my mother know?

767
01:24:02,279 --> 01:24:03,940
l don't know if she knew and
looked the other way,

768
01:24:04,514 --> 01:24:09,042
if she never knew.

769
01:24:11,788 --> 01:24:13,551
Why did you leave?

770
01:24:15,492 --> 01:24:18,461
l know you didn't get on
with our father.

771
01:24:23,667 --> 01:24:27,398
l worked for Geological Survey
and went to Kansas.

772
01:24:29,839 --> 01:24:32,865
l couldn't stay there.
l just couldn't.

773
01:24:34,611 --> 01:24:37,136
l don't like to explain myself.

774
01:24:43,186 --> 01:24:47,418
Are you an angry man, Henry?...
About what?

775
01:24:48,258 --> 01:24:52,024
Are you envious?
Do you get envious?

776
01:24:53,330 --> 01:24:55,264
l don't think so, no.

777
01:24:59,736 --> 01:25:02,068
l have a competition in me.

778
01:25:03,306 --> 01:25:05,706
l want no one else to succeed.

779
01:25:10,747 --> 01:25:13,200
l hate most people.

780
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:15,241
That part of me is gone.

781
01:25:16,486 --> 01:25:19,353
Working and not succeeding,

782
01:25:19,456 --> 01:25:23,449
all my failures have left me...

783
01:25:26,496 --> 01:25:28,361
l just don't care.

784
01:25:30,066 --> 01:25:32,660
Well, if it's in me, it's in you.

785
01:25:34,204 --> 01:25:37,762
There are times when
l look at people

786
01:25:37,762 --> 01:25:39,608
and l see nothing worth liking.

787
01:25:45,615 --> 01:25:49,642
l want to earn enough money l
can get away from everyone.

788
01:25:54,691 --> 01:25:57,159
What will you do about your boy?

789
01:26:04,901 --> 01:26:06,528
l don't know.

790
01:26:08,071 --> 01:26:10,505
Maybe it'll change.

791
01:26:10,674 --> 01:26:15,077
Does your sound come back to you?
l don't know. Maybe no one knows that.

792
01:26:15,211 --> 01:26:19,375
Doctor might not know that....
Where's his mother?

793
01:26:25,355 --> 01:26:28,381
l don't want to talk about
those things.

794
01:26:31,728 --> 01:26:33,958
l see the worst in people, Henry.

795
01:26:35,999 --> 01:26:39,833
l don't need to look past seeing
them to get all l need.

796
01:26:42,005 --> 01:26:45,964
l've built up my hatreds over
the years, little by little.

797
01:26:49,679 --> 01:26:53,012
Having you here gives me a
second breath of life.

798
01:26:54,250 --> 01:26:56,844
l can't keep doing this on my own

799
01:27:00,156 --> 01:27:05,219
with these people.

800
01:27:45,068 --> 01:27:47,593
Daniel! Daniel, wake up! Daniel!

801
01:29:29,939 --> 01:29:33,397
Just have to go and have a
word with the conductor.

802
01:29:34,177 --> 01:29:36,270
l'll be right back.

803
01:29:36,412 --> 01:29:41,111
You stay here. You understand?
You stay here.

804
01:29:42,185 --> 01:29:44,016
l'll be right back.

805
01:30:36,739 --> 01:30:38,570
No! No!

806
01:30:40,276 --> 01:30:41,504
No!

807
01:30:51,354 --> 01:30:52,878
Tilford!...Plainview.

808
01:30:53,022 --> 01:30:54,137
This is my brother,
Henry Plainview

809
01:30:54,137 --> 01:30:55,320
from Fond du Lac.

810
01:30:55,425 --> 01:30:57,052
H.M. Tilford. Pleasure.

811
01:30:57,193 --> 01:30:59,661
Henry Plainview. J.J. Carter.

812
01:31:01,698 --> 01:31:03,063
So...

813
01:31:03,199 --> 01:31:04,826
Shall we?...Yes.

814
01:31:13,009 --> 01:31:15,204
How's your boy?

815
01:31:15,345 --> 01:31:18,712
Thank you for asking....
ls there anything we can do?

816
01:31:18,848 --> 01:31:21,248
Thanks for asking is enough.

817
01:31:22,919 --> 01:31:24,910
So what are your plans?

818
01:31:26,689 --> 01:31:29,920
ls this about buying up my
tracts here?

819
01:31:30,059 --> 01:31:31,117
Yes.

820
01:31:31,227 --> 01:31:34,060
The cable was about my
Coyote Hills lease.

821
01:31:34,197 --> 01:31:38,361
We'd like that, too....What's
your offer on Coyote Hills?

822
01:31:38,501 --> 01:31:43,063
We'll offer 150,000 for full title
That's a deal. What's next?

823
01:31:43,906 --> 01:31:47,137
You have 1 1 ,000 acres
in Little Boston.

824
01:31:47,137 --> 01:31:48,468
You have one proven well

825
01:31:48,578 --> 01:31:50,068
that was damaged......l have
three wells proven.

826
01:31:50,213 --> 01:31:57,070
You haven't been paying attention.
That's three proven wells.

827
01:31:58,554 --> 01:32:00,454
We'll make you a millionaire
while you're sitting here

828
01:32:00,556 --> 01:32:01,903
from one minute to the next.

829
01:32:04,727 --> 01:32:07,491
And what else would l do
with myself?

830
01:32:09,232 --> 01:32:13,601
Are you asking me?...What else
would l do with myself?

831
01:32:14,237 --> 01:32:16,330
Take care of your son.

832
01:32:18,007 --> 01:32:20,475
l don't know what you would do.

833
01:32:23,079 --> 01:32:25,547
lf you were me and Standard
offered to buy what you had

834
01:32:25,681 --> 01:32:28,343
for a million dollars, why? So, why?

835
01:32:29,585 --> 01:32:30,677
You know why.

836
01:32:30,820 --> 01:32:32,651
Yeah, you fellas should just
scratch around in the dirt

837
01:32:32,755 --> 01:32:33,762
and find it like the rest of us,

838
01:32:33,762 --> 01:32:36,191
instead of buying up someone
else's hard work.

839
01:32:36,325 --> 01:32:38,259
l've scratched around the dirt,
son.

840
01:32:38,361 --> 01:32:40,352
You going to change your
shipping costs?

841
01:32:40,496 --> 01:32:43,465
We don't dictate shipping costs.
That's railroad business.

842
01:32:44,500 --> 01:32:47,128
You don't own the railroads?

843
01:32:51,140 --> 01:32:53,700
'Course you do. Of course you do.

844
01:32:55,411 --> 01:32:57,845
Where you going to put it all?

845
01:32:58,881 --> 01:33:00,314
Where?

846
01:33:02,151 --> 01:33:06,144
Build a pipeline? Make a deal
with Union Oil? Be my guest.

847
01:33:06,289 --> 01:33:07,950
But if you can't pull it off,

848
01:33:08,057 --> 01:33:12,153
you've got an ocean of oil under
your feet with nowhere to go.

849
01:33:13,162 --> 01:33:17,792
Why not turn it over to us?
We'll make you rich.

850
01:33:17,934 --> 01:33:20,232
You spend time with your boy.

851
01:33:21,304 --> 01:33:23,431
lt's a great discovery.

852
01:33:24,373 --> 01:33:26,466
Now, let us help you.

853
01:33:35,685 --> 01:33:38,779
Did you just tell me how to
run my family?

854
01:33:38,921 --> 01:33:41,116
lt might be more important now
that you've proven the field

855
01:33:41,257 --> 01:33:43,122
and we're offering to buy
you out.

856
01:33:43,259 --> 01:33:45,454
One night l'm going to come to
you, inside of your house,

857
01:33:45,595 --> 01:33:48,564
or wherever you're sleeping, and
l'm going to cut your throat.

858
01:33:48,664 --> 01:33:49,824
What?

859
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:51,862
What are you talking about?
Have you gone crazy?

860
01:33:51,968 --> 01:33:53,265
Did you hear what l said?...
l heard what you said,

861
01:33:53,402 --> 01:33:53,841
why did you say it?

862
01:33:53,841 --> 01:33:55,870
You don't tell me about my son.

863
01:33:55,972 --> 01:33:58,167
Why are you acting insane and
threatening to cut my throat?

864
01:33:58,274 --> 01:33:59,778
You don't tell me about my son.

865
01:33:59,778 --> 01:34:01,334
l'm not telling you anything!

866
01:34:01,444 --> 01:34:02,887
l'm asking you to be reasonable.

867
01:34:02,887 --> 01:34:05,244
lf l've offended you, l apologize.

868
01:34:05,381 --> 01:34:07,542
You'll see what l can do.

869
01:34:15,324 --> 01:34:19,522
This parcel here is the 3,000
acre ranch owned by B.L. Harper.

870
01:34:19,662 --> 01:34:22,153
This is San Luis Obispo
County land.

871
01:34:22,298 --> 01:34:24,129
And from here to the coast,
it's all Union Oil.

872
01:34:24,233 --> 01:34:27,361
What's this? Why don't l own this?

873
01:34:30,339 --> 01:34:32,950
Why don't l own this?

874
01:34:32,950 --> 01:34:34,867
That's the Bandy tract.

875
01:34:35,678 --> 01:34:38,841
He was the holdout, when
we were doing the buying.

876
01:34:38,948 --> 01:34:41,382
He had hoped to speak with you.

877
01:34:45,588 --> 01:34:49,080
Can't you just build the
pipeline around this tract?

878
01:34:52,061 --> 01:34:56,122
Can l build around 50 miles
of Tehachapi mountains?

879
01:34:56,265 --> 01:34:58,790
Don't be thick in front of me,
Al.

880
01:34:59,435 --> 01:35:00,388
l can go to him again.

881
01:35:00,388 --> 01:35:03,132
No, l'll go and talk to the man.

882
01:35:03,272 --> 01:35:06,173
l'll talk to him. Show you
how it's done.

883
01:35:10,012 --> 01:35:12,446
All right. Pack it up, Henry.

884
01:35:22,792 --> 01:35:26,694
How big is his room?...He's
sharing with another boy.

885
01:35:26,829 --> 01:35:29,662
Who?...An older boy. About 12.

886
01:35:29,765 --> 01:35:32,791
He's been there for a year.
Named Ballard.

887
01:35:38,007 --> 01:35:42,410
How big is the room?...lt's a
fair size. Got enough space.

888
01:35:44,714 --> 01:35:47,945
Are you taking Henry with you
to meet Union Oil?

889
01:36:01,230 --> 01:36:03,013
Are you the son of
William Bandy?

890
01:36:03,013 --> 01:36:04,791
Grandson.

891
01:36:04,900 --> 01:36:06,663
ls he here?...No, he's out.

892
01:36:06,802 --> 01:36:07,860
Where is he?

893
01:36:08,004 --> 01:36:10,871
Told you, he's out. Now,
what do you want?

894
01:36:14,377 --> 01:36:16,357
l'm Daniel Plainview.

895
01:36:16,357 --> 01:36:18,313
l want to talk with him about
his property.

896
01:36:18,414 --> 01:36:23,283
About what?...l believe l'll
talk with him about that.

897
01:36:23,753 --> 01:36:26,187
You're that oilman, aren't
you?...That's right.

898
01:36:26,322 --> 01:36:28,290
We don't want you drilling
out here.

899
01:36:28,391 --> 01:36:31,792
l don't want it either. Now,
when will he be back?

900
01:36:31,894 --> 01:36:32,952
Few days.

901
01:36:33,062 --> 01:36:35,656
Tell him l'd like to speak
with him. Not about drilling.

902
01:36:35,765 --> 01:36:37,995
And l'll be back in a week.

903
01:38:57,106 --> 01:38:59,233
Put that in a glass case.

904
01:39:00,142 --> 01:39:02,007
Here's to Union Oil.

905
01:39:02,711 --> 01:39:03,769
Hundred miles of pipeline,

906
01:39:03,913 --> 01:39:06,347
and all the independent producers
of this great state.

907
01:39:06,449 --> 01:39:07,416
Cheers.

908
01:39:32,575 --> 01:39:35,271
There's that house in Fond du Lac

909
01:39:37,179 --> 01:39:40,444
that John Hollister built.
Do you remember it?

910
01:39:43,319 --> 01:39:46,755
l thought as a boy that was the most
beautiful house l'd ever seen,

911
01:39:46,856 --> 01:39:48,483
and l wanted it.

912
01:39:49,225 --> 01:39:51,693
l wanted to live in it.

913
01:39:51,827 --> 01:39:53,351
And eat in it.

914
01:39:54,230 --> 01:39:55,822
And clean it.

915
01:39:58,834 --> 01:40:03,134
And even as a boy, l wanted to have
children to run around in it.

916
01:40:04,840 --> 01:40:06,325
You can have anything you'd like now

917
01:40:06,325 --> 01:40:07,570
Daniel.

918
01:40:08,277 --> 01:40:09,904
And you should.

919
01:40:10,679 --> 01:40:15,343
Where are you going to build it?...
Here, maybe. Near the ocean.

920
01:40:18,254 --> 01:40:21,018
Would you make it look like
that house?

921
01:40:25,761 --> 01:40:29,219
l think if l saw that house now,
it'd make me sick.

922
01:40:35,671 --> 01:40:38,139
We can eat and get some women.

923
01:40:41,110 --> 01:40:43,237
Take them to the Peachtree dance.

924
01:40:46,982 --> 01:40:50,918
l say get liquored up and take
them to the Peachtree dance.

925
01:40:53,822 --> 01:40:55,050
Yeah.

926
01:42:14,003 --> 01:42:16,403
Can l have some money, please?

927
01:42:23,812 --> 01:42:26,212
Can l have some money, please?

928
01:43:15,297 --> 01:43:17,788
l want you to tell me something.

929
01:43:21,470 --> 01:43:22,630
What?

930
01:43:23,672 --> 01:43:27,130
What's the name of the farm
next to the Hill House?

931
01:43:38,187 --> 01:43:42,851
What was the name of the farm
next to the Hill House?

932
01:43:46,395 --> 01:43:49,387
l can't remember......
Who are you?

933
01:43:52,334 --> 01:43:54,234
l'll leave, Daniel.

934
01:43:56,004 --> 01:43:57,562
Who are you?

935
01:44:00,909 --> 01:44:02,433
l'm no one.

936
01:44:03,512 --> 01:44:05,776
Just let me get up and go.

937
01:44:08,283 --> 01:44:10,148
Do l have a brother?

938
01:44:14,123 --> 01:44:19,322
l met a man in King City
who said he was your brother.

939
01:44:21,864 --> 01:44:24,958
We were friends for months.

940
01:44:26,435 --> 01:44:28,369
Working in King City.

941
01:44:30,606 --> 01:44:33,473
And he wanted to make his
way to you, Daniel.

942
01:44:34,743 --> 01:44:36,870
We didn't have any money.

943
01:44:41,750 --> 01:44:44,014
He died of tuberculosis.

944
01:44:45,454 --> 01:44:47,285
He wasn't harmed.

945
01:44:48,323 --> 01:44:50,553
Wasn't killed, nothing bad.

946
01:44:52,394 --> 01:44:54,658
But he told me about you,

947
01:44:57,699 --> 01:44:59,997
and l just took his story,

948
01:45:03,705 --> 01:45:05,502
used his diary.

949
01:45:09,144 --> 01:45:10,111
Daniel.

950
01:45:11,747 --> 01:45:15,080
Daniel, l'm your friend.

951
01:45:17,286 --> 01:45:19,720
l'm not trying to hurt you.

952
01:45:19,855 --> 01:45:21,083
Never.

953
01:45:22,224 --> 01:45:23,748
Just survive.

954
01:45:24,293 --> 01:45:25,521
No!

955
01:48:35,150 --> 01:48:36,617
Who is it?

956
01:48:37,919 --> 01:48:39,386
l'm Bandy.

957
01:48:52,167 --> 01:48:54,032
Yes. Yes.

958
01:48:56,538 --> 01:48:58,267
William Bandy.

959
01:49:01,476 --> 01:49:04,104
Yeah, l'd like to lease your land.

960
01:49:06,548 --> 01:49:10,109
l had asked for you to come
and talk to me before.

961
01:49:10,218 --> 01:49:12,482
When you were leasing land.

962
01:49:13,722 --> 01:49:15,519
That's right, yes.

963
01:49:17,225 --> 01:49:19,750
My boy's been very sick, you know.

964
01:49:20,896 --> 01:49:23,421
This was before your boy got sick.

965
01:49:26,535 --> 01:49:31,063
Now, l know that you would
like to build a pipeline

966
01:49:31,206 --> 01:49:33,868
through my property.

967
01:49:33,975 --> 01:49:38,105
ls that right, what l've heard?...
lt's absolutely right. And,

968
01:49:38,814 --> 01:49:39,781
well...

969
01:49:41,083 --> 01:49:44,314
Eight inch pipe. lt could be
buried with your consent.

970
01:49:44,453 --> 01:49:46,978
l guarantee you absolutely
no disruption...

971
01:49:47,122 --> 01:49:48,282
God.

972
01:49:50,158 --> 01:49:52,786
God has told me what you must do.

973
01:49:57,165 --> 01:49:58,894
And what is that?

974
01:49:59,868 --> 01:50:03,770
You should be washed in the
blood of Jesus Christ.

975
01:50:05,574 --> 01:50:07,508
But l am.

976
01:50:09,044 --> 01:50:11,740
l have been washed, Mr. Bandy.
l have been.

977
01:50:11,880 --> 01:50:14,450
lt's your only way to salvation.

978
01:50:14,450 --> 01:50:17,580
And your only way for what
you want.

979
01:50:19,421 --> 01:50:22,982
You can take it at the Church
of the Third Revelation.

980
01:50:25,427 --> 01:50:27,395
l'll pay you $3,000.

981
01:50:30,031 --> 01:50:32,795
l'd like you to be part of
our church.

982
01:50:34,703 --> 01:50:36,603
l'll pay you $5,000.

983
01:50:37,706 --> 01:50:39,173
Be baptized.

984
01:50:40,542 --> 01:50:44,376
Be forgiven for the sin
that you've done.

985
01:50:48,650 --> 01:50:53,519
What sin are you referring
to, Mr. Bandy?

986
01:50:54,689 --> 01:50:56,591
My sin of drilling?

987
01:51:47,275 --> 01:51:51,268
l truly wish everyone could
be saved, don't you?

988
01:51:51,413 --> 01:51:53,313
Yes.

989
01:51:53,448 --> 01:51:56,144
l am afraid that's
just not the case.

990
01:51:57,018 --> 01:52:01,512
The doctrine of universal
salvation is a lie, is it not?

991
01:52:01,656 --> 01:52:04,284
lt's a lie....lt's a lie.

992
01:52:04,392 --> 01:52:06,138
l wish everyone could be saved

993
01:52:06,138 --> 01:52:09,159
but they won't. No, they won't.

994
01:52:09,297 --> 01:52:12,755
You will never be saved if you...

995
01:52:12,867 --> 01:52:14,835
Reject the blood.

996
01:52:15,670 --> 01:52:16,830
Good.

997
01:52:17,906 --> 01:52:22,366
Now, is there a sinner here
looking for salvation?

998
01:52:25,046 --> 01:52:26,638
A new member?

999
01:52:31,119 --> 01:52:32,882
l'll ask it again.

1000
01:52:34,889 --> 01:52:37,585
ls there a sinner here
looking for God?

1001
01:52:37,726 --> 01:52:38,886
Yes.

1002
01:52:42,998 --> 01:52:44,431
Allow me.

1003
01:52:46,668 --> 01:52:49,432
Thank you for coming,
brother Daniel.

1004
01:52:51,539 --> 01:52:53,200
Thank you, Eli.

1005
01:52:54,342 --> 01:52:59,439
We have a sinner with us here
who wishes for salvation!

1006
01:52:59,547 --> 01:53:03,142
Daniel, are you a sinner?...Yes.

1007
01:53:03,251 --> 01:53:05,947
The Lord can't hear you, Daniel.

1008
01:53:06,054 --> 01:53:09,888
Say it to him. Go ahead and
speak to him. lt's all right.

1009
01:53:10,692 --> 01:53:12,990
Yes....Down on your knees.

1010
01:53:13,094 --> 01:53:14,652
Pray to him.

1011
01:53:16,064 --> 01:53:20,433
Look up to the sky and say it.

1012
01:53:23,038 --> 01:53:25,199
What do you want me to say?

1013
01:53:26,241 --> 01:53:30,735
Daniel, you've come here and
you've brought good and wealth,

1014
01:53:30,845 --> 01:53:35,043
but you have also brought your
bad habits as a backslider.

1015
01:53:35,150 --> 01:53:39,416
You've lusted after women, and
you have abandoned your child.

1016
01:53:39,521 --> 01:53:42,581
Your child, that you raised,
you have abandoned

1017
01:53:42,691 --> 01:53:45,125
all because he was sick and
you have sinned.

1018
01:53:45,260 --> 01:53:47,421
So say it now. l am a sinner.

1019
01:53:47,529 --> 01:53:49,429
l am a sinner....Say it louder.

1020
01:53:49,531 --> 01:53:52,261
l am a sinner....l am a sinner.

1021
01:53:52,400 --> 01:53:54,300
Louder, Daniel! l am a sinner!

1022
01:53:54,436 --> 01:53:57,371
l am a sinner....l am sorry, Lord.

1023
01:53:57,472 --> 01:53:59,633
l am sorry, Lord....
l want the blood.

1024
01:53:59,774 --> 01:54:03,141
l want the blood....You have
abandoned your child.

1025
01:54:03,912 --> 01:54:05,209
l have abandoned my child.

1026
01:54:05,313 --> 01:54:07,645
l will never backslide....
l will never backslide.

1027
01:54:07,782 --> 01:54:10,774
l was lost, but now l am found.

1028
01:54:10,919 --> 01:54:12,294
l was lost, but now l'm found.

1029
01:54:12,294 --> 01:54:14,821
l have abandoned my child.

1030
01:54:16,591 --> 01:54:19,754
Say it. Say it.

1031
01:54:19,861 --> 01:54:22,887
l abandoned my child....Say it
louder. Say it louder!

1032
01:54:22,997 --> 01:54:25,090
l've abandoned my child!

1033
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,525
l've abandoned my child!

1034
01:54:28,670 --> 01:54:30,661
l've abandoned my boy!

1035
01:54:30,805 --> 01:54:33,205
Now beg for the blood!

1036
01:54:34,409 --> 01:54:36,274
Just give me the blood, Eli.
Let me get out of here.

1037
01:54:36,378 --> 01:54:39,142
Give me the blood, Lord,
and let me get away!

1038
01:54:39,247 --> 01:54:43,013
Do you accept Jesus Christ as
your Lord and Savior?

1039
01:54:43,151 --> 01:54:45,881
Yes, l do....Get out of here,
devil!

1040
01:54:46,020 --> 01:54:48,818
Out, devil! Out, sin!

1041
01:54:48,990 --> 01:54:51,515
Let me feel the power of the
Lord, Eli....Do you accept

1042
01:54:51,659 --> 01:54:55,527
the Church of the Third Revelation
as your spiritual guide?

1043
01:54:57,065 --> 01:55:01,263
Get out of here, ghost!...
Where is your Lord, Eli?

1044
01:55:01,403 --> 01:55:03,888
Get out! Go back where you belong!

1045
01:55:03,888 --> 01:55:05,464
Where is he? There he is!

1046
01:55:05,607 --> 01:55:09,202
Do you accept Jesus Christ
as your Savior?

1047
01:55:09,310 --> 01:55:10,743
Yes, l do.

1048
01:55:13,515 --> 01:55:17,815
Would you be free from the
burden of sin?

1049
01:55:17,952 --> 01:55:20,284
There's power in the blood

1050
01:55:20,422 --> 01:55:22,447
Power in the blood

1051
01:55:22,724 --> 01:55:24,521
Would you o'er evil a
victory win?

1052
01:55:24,626 --> 01:55:26,821
There's a pipeline.

1053
01:55:26,961 --> 01:55:31,125
There's wonderful power
in the blood

1054
01:55:31,266 --> 01:55:35,635
There is power, power
wonder-working power

1055
01:55:35,737 --> 01:55:39,434
ln the blood of the Lamb

1056
01:55:39,541 --> 01:55:41,304
Praise the Lord!

1057
01:55:45,914 --> 01:55:48,781
Welcome to the fold,
brother Plainview.

1058
01:56:00,128 --> 01:56:02,392
Welcome, brother Daniel.
God bless you.

1059
01:56:03,665 --> 01:56:05,098
God bless you.

1060
01:56:08,269 --> 01:56:09,930
Hallelujah....Amen.

1061
01:56:10,371 --> 01:56:12,305
Welcome home, brother.

1062
01:56:12,941 --> 01:56:16,399
That's enough. That's enough, now.

1063
01:56:18,646 --> 01:56:22,810
He must take the spirit
in on his own.

1064
01:56:25,587 --> 01:56:27,452
We have a new member.

1065
01:56:27,589 --> 01:56:29,716
Yes, brother....Hallelujah.

1066
01:56:29,824 --> 01:56:31,792
Hallelujah....Amen.

1067
01:56:33,962 --> 01:56:36,055
My sweet Mary....
Mr. Plainview has been generous

1068
01:56:36,164 --> 01:56:38,894
enough to make a $5,000 donation

1069
01:56:39,033 --> 01:56:42,430
to the church which we are
still waiting for.

1070
01:57:54,208 --> 01:57:57,507
That does me good.
That does me good.

1071
01:57:59,614 --> 01:58:01,445
Welcome home, son.

1072
01:58:04,052 --> 01:58:06,020
Welcome home, son.

1073
01:58:09,958 --> 01:58:12,017
This here's George Reynolds.
Teacher from the deaf school.

1074
01:58:12,126 --> 01:58:15,118
Mr. Plainview....Fletcher.

1075
01:58:17,932 --> 01:58:20,025
You're too heavy for me.

1076
01:58:23,104 --> 01:58:25,800
Do you want to get something to eat?

1077
01:58:27,008 --> 01:58:31,308
That's the pipeline, see?
All the way to the sea.

1078
01:58:52,433 --> 01:58:53,991
Come here.

1079
01:59:00,875 --> 01:59:02,638
l love you, son.

1080
01:59:04,545 --> 01:59:06,672
Let's take a look at you.

1081
01:59:08,950 --> 01:59:11,817
All right. That's it, that's it.
That's it.

1082
01:59:35,877 --> 01:59:39,176
Let's get some decent food
inside of you.

1083
01:59:39,280 --> 01:59:43,080
That's all we need here is a good,
strong, expensive meal.

1084
01:59:43,718 --> 01:59:45,208
You hungry?

1085
01:59:46,287 --> 01:59:47,379
Waiter?...Yes, sir.

1086
01:59:47,522 --> 01:59:50,514
Two steaks, a whiskey,
and water for him.

1087
01:59:52,160 --> 01:59:54,685
And goat's milk....
Very good, sir.

1088
02:00:01,502 --> 02:00:04,437
We're going to have this
teacher help you.

1089
02:00:05,006 --> 02:00:09,466
He's going to help take care
of all of this. Understand?

1090
02:00:09,610 --> 02:00:12,306
'Cause l need you.
Need your help.

1091
02:00:12,447 --> 02:00:16,406
Got everything we need now to
build this company. Come here.

1092
02:00:24,225 --> 02:00:25,920
Good afternoon.

1093
02:00:42,076 --> 02:00:44,135
How are you doing?...
lt's nice to see you again.

1094
02:00:44,245 --> 02:00:47,043
We need four....
l'll have them right up.

1095
02:00:51,219 --> 02:00:53,210
Good afternoon,
Daniel....Tilford.

1096
02:00:53,321 --> 02:00:54,686
Good afternoon.

1097
02:00:56,257 --> 02:01:01,524
Hello! H.M. Tilford!...
You don't have to shout.

1098
02:01:03,564 --> 02:01:04,963
Pleasure.

1099
02:01:09,670 --> 02:01:11,934
lt's good to be in Little B.

1100
02:01:13,207 --> 02:01:16,506
Could use some rain out
here....Yeah, we could.

1101
02:01:17,378 --> 02:01:20,472
There we go....R.J.,
how's the London broil?

1102
02:01:20,615 --> 02:01:23,277
Believe we ordered these
drinks before those people.

1103
02:01:23,384 --> 02:01:25,387
R.J., tell us.
How's the London broil?

1104
02:01:25,387 --> 02:01:27,650
Excuse me, gentlemen. Sorry.

1105
02:01:29,724 --> 02:01:33,660
l am sorry about that, sir.
l'll have your steaks right out.

1106
02:01:43,504 --> 02:01:46,064
So that green turtle soup is
fantastic....ls it?

1107
02:01:46,207 --> 02:01:47,834
lt's delicious.

1108
02:01:52,880 --> 02:01:53,847
Sounds good to me.

1109
02:01:53,981 --> 02:01:57,325
So Standard offered us a
million dollars

1110
02:01:57,325 --> 02:01:59,715
for the Little Boston leases.

1111
02:01:59,821 --> 02:02:02,722
l told H.M. Tilford where
he could shove that.

1112
02:02:02,824 --> 02:02:07,420
And we made a deal with Union!
On the pipeline!

1113
02:02:07,562 --> 02:02:11,020
And that whole ocean of oil
underneath our fields.

1114
02:02:11,132 --> 02:02:12,793
...$150,000....Yes.

1115
02:02:12,900 --> 02:02:15,198
We needed the money to drill.

1116
02:02:15,336 --> 02:02:17,566
Who is this guy?...
l go out to meet him.

1117
02:02:17,672 --> 02:02:20,436
He's getting oil on the property.
We're trying to make a claim on it.

1118
02:02:20,575 --> 02:02:22,475
Offered him a million dollars.

1119
02:02:22,610 --> 02:02:25,807
Turned us down flat....
Well, l'm hungry.

1120
02:02:25,947 --> 02:02:30,577
Orange fritters, mashed potatoes,
green peas.

1121
02:02:30,685 --> 02:02:33,153
All the way around?...All right.

1122
02:02:36,057 --> 02:02:37,422
Hold on.

1123
02:02:41,195 --> 02:02:43,459
l want you to look over there.

1124
02:02:43,564 --> 02:02:44,325
Daniel, let me introduce...

1125
02:02:44,325 --> 02:02:46,362
Look over there. You see?

1126
02:02:46,500 --> 02:02:48,593
That's my son. See him?

1127
02:02:48,703 --> 02:02:51,035
Yes....Do you see?

1128
02:02:53,374 --> 02:02:54,807
l see him.

1129
02:02:55,676 --> 02:02:58,543
You don't tell me how to raise
my family.

1130
02:03:00,681 --> 02:03:04,208
l told you not to tell me
how to raise my family.

1131
02:03:05,686 --> 02:03:07,551
Daniel...

1132
02:03:08,389 --> 02:03:10,220
So what do you see?

1133
02:03:12,226 --> 02:03:13,575
l'm very happy for you
that the deal...

1134
02:03:13,575 --> 02:03:15,389
Yes, l made a deal with Union.

1135
02:03:15,496 --> 02:03:17,862
My son is happy. He's safe....
Congratulations.

1136
02:03:17,965 --> 02:03:21,128
l'm taking care of him now,
so......Excellent.

1137
02:03:22,436 --> 02:03:25,428
You look like a fool,
don't you, Tilford?

1138
02:03:30,111 --> 02:03:32,944
Yes....Yes.

1139
02:03:34,782 --> 02:03:36,443
Yes, you do.

1140
02:03:37,351 --> 02:03:38,818
Excuse me, gentlemen.

1141
02:03:39,153 --> 02:03:42,384
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Excuse him, gentlemen.

1142
02:03:45,927 --> 02:03:48,555
l told you what l was going to do.

1143
02:03:58,873 --> 02:04:00,101
My son.

1144
02:04:18,159 --> 02:04:21,458
Mr. Sunday, l understand that
you're leaving our fair community.

1145
02:04:21,595 --> 02:04:24,723
Yes, l'm going on a mission....
Where you going?

1146
02:04:24,832 --> 02:04:26,993
Oildale, Taft, and then on to
Bakersfield.

1147
02:04:27,134 --> 02:04:29,466
Well, l want you to know...

1148
02:04:29,603 --> 02:04:31,468
Three quarters of an hour.

1149
02:04:31,605 --> 02:04:33,129
...you done a great job for us.

1150
02:04:33,274 --> 02:04:36,141
Thank you. You will be in my
prayers....l thank you very much.

1151
02:04:36,243 --> 02:04:39,508
Union Oil Company,
Santa Paula, California.

1152
02:06:48,509 --> 02:06:52,309
''The woman saith unto him,
'Sir, give me this water

1153
02:06:53,347 --> 02:06:58,307
'''and l shall thirst not,
neither come hither to draw.'''

1154
02:08:39,820 --> 02:08:41,481
Come in, come in.

1155
02:09:08,249 --> 02:09:10,479
Can we be alone?

1156
02:09:10,584 --> 02:09:14,281
This is my closest associate.
He hears everything.

1157
02:09:21,362 --> 02:09:26,425
l'd prefer to speak to you
in private....You can't speak.

1158
02:09:26,533 --> 02:09:28,763
So why don't you flap your
hands about

1159
02:09:28,869 --> 02:09:32,430
and have what'shisname
tell me where you've been.

1160
02:09:40,414 --> 02:09:43,144
Or do you think l don't know?

1161
02:09:57,631 --> 02:09:59,861
This is hard for me to say.

1162
02:10:00,968 --> 02:10:05,098
l'll tell you first,
l love you very much.

1163
02:10:08,375 --> 02:10:12,368
l've learned to love what
l do because of you.

1164
02:10:15,816 --> 02:10:17,681
l'm leaving here.

1165
02:10:19,119 --> 02:10:21,451
l'm going to Mexico.

1166
02:10:21,588 --> 02:10:24,557
l'm taking Mary,
and l'm going to Mexico.

1167
02:10:26,226 --> 02:10:28,319
l miss working outside.

1168
02:10:29,363 --> 02:10:31,228
l miss the fields.

1169
02:10:34,201 --> 02:10:36,328
lt'll only be for a time,

1170
02:10:37,538 --> 02:10:39,870
for me to do my own drilling

1171
02:10:41,575 --> 02:10:43,702
and start my own company.

1172
02:10:46,714 --> 02:10:51,174
lt's time to make a change.

1173
02:11:04,231 --> 02:11:06,722
This makes you my competitor.

1174
02:11:10,704 --> 02:11:15,801
No. No, it's not like that....
lt is like that, boy.

1175
02:11:17,044 --> 02:11:19,012
Your own company, huh?

1176
02:11:19,446 --> 02:11:20,936
That's right.

1177
02:11:23,283 --> 02:11:25,046
ln Mexico?

1178
02:11:26,520 --> 02:11:27,578
Yes.

1179
02:11:27,688 --> 02:11:32,751
You are making such a misstep.
So, what are you doing?

1180
02:11:34,795 --> 02:11:38,128
l know you and l have disagreed
over many things.

1181
02:11:39,066 --> 02:11:43,400
l'd rather keep you as my
father than my partner.

1182
02:11:43,504 --> 02:11:44,971
Then say it.

1183
02:11:45,105 --> 02:11:46,800
lf you've got something to
say to me, then say it.

1184
02:11:46,907 --> 02:11:50,570
l'd like to hear you speak
instead of your little dog.

1185
02:12:08,695 --> 02:12:11,357
l'm going to Mexico with my wife.

1186
02:12:12,366 --> 02:12:14,493
l'm going away from you.

1187
02:12:20,541 --> 02:12:23,203
That wasn't so hard, was it?

1188
02:12:25,145 --> 02:12:27,773
Killing us with what you're doing.

1189
02:12:30,684 --> 02:12:34,142
You're killing my image
of you as my son.

1190
02:12:34,288 --> 02:12:37,655
You are stubborn. You won't listen.

1191
02:12:37,791 --> 02:12:40,089
You're not my son.

1192
02:12:40,194 --> 02:12:43,391
Please don't say that.
l know you don't mean it.

1193
02:12:43,497 --> 02:12:47,456
lt's the truth. You're not my son.
You never have been.

1194
02:12:48,836 --> 02:12:50,633
You're an orphan!

1195
02:12:53,340 --> 02:12:55,570
Did you ever hear that word?

1196
02:12:57,077 --> 02:12:58,977
Tell him what l said.

1197
02:12:59,746 --> 02:13:02,715
You operated here today like one.

1198
02:13:04,351 --> 02:13:06,819
l should have seen this coming.

1199
02:13:08,322 --> 02:13:13,157
l should have known that,
under this all, these past years

1200
02:13:13,293 --> 02:13:16,660
you've been building new hate
for me, piece by piece.

1201
02:13:16,797 --> 02:13:20,426
l don't even know who you are
because you have none of me in you.

1202
02:13:20,534 --> 02:13:23,401
You're someone else's.

1203
02:13:24,838 --> 02:13:28,296
This anger. Your maliciousness.

1204
02:13:29,409 --> 02:13:32,310
Backwards dealings with me.

1205
02:13:33,981 --> 02:13:37,940
You're an orphan from a basket
in the middle of the desert.

1206
02:13:40,754 --> 02:13:42,575
And l took you for no other
reason than

1207
02:13:42,575 --> 02:13:45,714
l needed a sweet face to
buy land.

1208
02:13:47,227 --> 02:13:48,990
Did you get that?

1209
02:13:50,230 --> 02:13:53,990
So now you know.

1210
02:13:55,302 --> 02:13:59,602
Look at me! You're lower
than a bastard.

1211
02:14:24,565 --> 02:14:27,028
You have none of me in you.

1212
02:14:27,028 --> 02:14:29,025
You're just a bastard from a basket.

1213
02:14:38,712 --> 02:14:42,978
l thank God l have none of
you in me.

1214
02:14:47,888 --> 02:14:52,348
Not my son. Just a little
piece of competition.

1215
02:14:54,261 --> 02:14:56,354
Bastard from a basket.

1216
02:14:58,765 --> 02:15:00,960
Bastard from a basket!

1217
02:15:09,343 --> 02:15:11,868
You're a bastard from a basket!

1218
02:16:14,408 --> 02:16:16,205
Get up, Mr. Daniel.

1219
02:16:20,580 --> 02:16:22,138
Mr. Daniel.

1220
02:16:24,117 --> 02:16:26,677
Mr. Daniel, you've got a visitor.

1221
02:16:30,357 --> 02:16:32,188
Wake up, Mr. Daniel.

1222
02:16:34,928 --> 02:16:36,520
Sir?

1223
02:16:50,043 --> 02:16:51,977
You can leave us now.

1224
02:17:00,287 --> 02:17:01,254
Daniel.

1225
02:17:04,624 --> 02:17:05,784
Daniel.

1226
02:17:08,395 --> 02:17:11,592
Daniel Plainview,
the house is on fire!

1227
02:17:16,269 --> 02:17:19,238
Brother Daniel, it's Eli.

1228
02:17:29,483 --> 02:17:33,214
Yes, it is. Yes, it is.

1229
02:17:35,322 --> 02:17:37,256
l'll make us a drink.

1230
02:17:43,830 --> 02:17:46,993
Your home is a miracle.

1231
02:17:48,268 --> 02:17:49,536
lt's beautiful.

1232
02:17:49,536 --> 02:17:49,900
lt's beautiful.

1233
02:17:50,537 --> 02:17:52,596
God bless it.

1234
02:17:52,739 --> 02:17:56,732
l've been spreading
His word far and wide.

1235
02:17:58,011 --> 02:17:59,808
Far and wide.

1236
02:18:01,615 --> 02:18:04,379
So much travel for Him.

1237
02:18:09,089 --> 02:18:11,489
l've been working in radio.

1238
02:18:14,194 --> 02:18:18,153
Yes, so much...
So much has been happening.

1239
02:18:19,199 --> 02:18:24,660
To be here and find you and
see you well is wonderful.

1240
02:18:24,805 --> 02:18:27,365
And we have a chance to catch up.

1241
02:18:40,520 --> 02:18:42,579
No. Thank you so much.

1242
02:19:00,707 --> 02:19:02,231
My brother.

1243
02:19:03,643 --> 02:19:06,908
Daniel, my brother by marriage.

1244
02:19:08,915 --> 02:19:13,011
We're such old friends.
So much time.

1245
02:19:19,526 --> 02:19:22,620
Things go up, things go down,

1246
02:19:22,729 --> 02:19:27,029
but at least the Lord is
always around.

1247
02:19:28,635 --> 02:19:31,297
We've seen ups and downs,
haven't we?

1248
02:19:35,108 --> 02:19:38,077
Are things down for you right
now, Eli?

1249
02:19:39,446 --> 02:19:40,845
No. No.

1250
02:19:43,283 --> 02:19:45,911
But l do come with some sad news.

1251
02:19:47,654 --> 02:19:50,384
Perhaps you remember Mr. Bandy?

1252
02:19:53,026 --> 02:19:56,359
Mr. Bandy has passed on
to the Lord.

1253
02:19:57,297 --> 02:20:00,460
He lived to be 99 years old,
God bless him.

1254
02:20:01,167 --> 02:20:05,035
Mr. Bandy has a grandson.
Have you met his grandson, William?

1255
02:20:06,039 --> 02:20:10,635
William Bandy is one of the
finest members we have

1256
02:20:10,744 --> 02:20:13,304
at the Church of the
Third Revelation.

1257
02:20:13,413 --> 02:20:16,712
He's eager to come to Hollywood
to be in movies.

1258
02:20:18,184 --> 02:20:20,345
He is very goodlooking.

1259
02:20:22,555 --> 02:20:27,549
And l do think he will have
success....That's wonderful.

1260
02:20:29,696 --> 02:20:32,460
Would you like me to speak
with him?

1261
02:20:39,873 --> 02:20:44,606
Daniel, l'm asking if you'd
like to have business

1262
02:20:44,744 --> 02:20:46,974
with the Church of the
Third Revelation

1263
02:20:47,080 --> 02:20:51,312
in developing this lease on
young Bandy's 1 ,000acre tract.

1264
02:20:53,787 --> 02:20:55,379
l'm offering you to drill

1265
02:20:55,522 --> 02:20:58,980
on one of the great undeveloped
fields of Little Boston.

1266
02:20:59,092 --> 02:21:03,222
l'd be happy to work with
you....You would?

1267
02:21:04,831 --> 02:21:07,664
Yes, yes, of course.
That's wonderful.

1268
02:21:07,801 --> 02:21:10,770
But there is one
condition for this work.

1269
02:21:10,870 --> 02:21:12,360
All right.

1270
02:21:14,441 --> 02:21:17,968
l'd like you to tell me that
you are a false prophet.

1271
02:21:23,350 --> 02:21:28,754
l'd like you to tell me that you
are, and have been a false prophet.

1272
02:21:29,956 --> 02:21:32,322
And that God is a superstition.

1273
02:21:38,431 --> 02:21:40,228
But that's a lie.

1274
02:21:43,036 --> 02:21:45,561
lt's a lie. l cannot say it.

1275
02:21:59,853 --> 02:22:02,287
When can we begin to drill?...
Very soon.

1276
02:22:02,389 --> 02:22:03,981
How long will it take to
bring in the well?

1277
02:22:04,124 --> 02:22:06,024
lt shouldn't take long.

1278
02:22:06,159 --> 02:22:09,424
l would like a $100,000
signing bonus,

1279
02:22:09,529 --> 02:22:12,794
plus the five that is owed
to me with interest.

1280
02:22:13,500 --> 02:22:15,263
That's only fair.

1281
02:22:21,041 --> 02:22:25,808
l am a false prophet,
and God is a superstition.

1282
02:22:25,945 --> 02:22:28,914
lf that's what you believe,
then l will say it.

1283
02:22:29,015 --> 02:22:32,507
Say it like you mean it....
Daniel.

1284
02:22:33,053 --> 02:22:35,385
Say it like it's your sermon.

1285
02:22:38,558 --> 02:22:40,185
Don't smile.

1286
02:22:45,965 --> 02:22:47,865
l am a false prophet.

1287
02:22:47,967 --> 02:22:51,300
God is a superstition....
Why don't you stand up?

1288
02:22:54,374 --> 02:22:56,365
Put your glass down.

1289
02:23:08,555 --> 02:23:12,116
l am a false prophet.

1290
02:23:12,258 --> 02:23:15,318
God is a superstition....
Eli, stop.

1291
02:23:15,428 --> 02:23:20,832
Just imagine this is your church here
and you have a full congregation, so...

1292
02:23:23,369 --> 02:23:27,135
l am a false prophet.
God is a superstition.

1293
02:23:27,240 --> 02:23:28,832
Say it again.

1294
02:23:29,909 --> 02:23:33,966
l am a false prophet.
God is a superstition.

1295
02:23:33,966 --> 02:23:35,006
They can't hear you at the back.

1296
02:23:35,148 --> 02:23:38,515
l am a false prophet.
God is a superstition.

1297
02:23:38,651 --> 02:23:39,675
Say it again.

1298
02:23:39,819 --> 02:23:44,449
l am a false prophet!
God is a superstition!

1299
02:23:44,557 --> 02:23:46,252
Say it again.

1300
02:23:46,359 --> 02:23:50,090
l am a false prophet!
God is a superstition!

1301
02:23:51,297 --> 02:23:53,629
Those areas have been drilled.

1302
02:23:56,736 --> 02:23:58,135
What?

1303
02:23:58,271 --> 02:24:00,865
Those areas,
they've been drilled.

1304
02:24:02,475 --> 02:24:06,002
No, they haven't....
Yes, it's...

1305
02:24:06,112 --> 02:24:07,443
lt's called drainage, Eli.

1306
02:24:07,580 --> 02:24:12,415
See, l own everything around it, so,
of course, l get what's underneath it.

1307
02:24:13,887 --> 02:24:17,050
But there are no derricks there.

1308
02:24:17,190 --> 02:24:19,556
This is the Bandy tract.
Do you understand?

1309
02:24:19,692 --> 02:24:21,660
Do you understand, Eli?

1310
02:24:22,395 --> 02:24:25,626
That's more to the point.
Do you understand?

1311
02:24:25,732 --> 02:24:31,136
l drink your water.
l drink it up every day.

1312
02:24:32,138 --> 02:24:36,370
l drink the blood of Lamb
from Bandy's tract.

1313
02:24:41,648 --> 02:24:43,741
You can sit down again.

1314
02:25:01,901 --> 02:25:03,232
Daniel.

1315
02:25:06,506 --> 02:25:07,495
Daniel.

1316
02:25:11,377 --> 02:25:12,674
Please.

1317
02:25:15,315 --> 02:25:19,649
l am in desperate times....
l know.

1318
02:25:19,752 --> 02:25:22,619
l need a friend....Yes.
Of course, you do.

1319
02:25:23,022 --> 02:25:24,614
l've sinned.

1320
02:25:26,392 --> 02:25:29,486
l need help. l'm a sinner.

1321
02:25:29,629 --> 02:25:34,225
l've let the devil grab hold
of me in ways l never imagined.

1322
02:25:34,334 --> 02:25:35,767
l'm so full of sin.

1323
02:25:35,868 --> 02:25:39,133
The Lord sometimes challenges
us, doesn't He, Eli?

1324
02:25:39,272 --> 02:25:41,240
Yes, He does, Daniel....
Yes, He does.

1325
02:25:41,341 --> 02:25:43,935
Yes, He does!

1326
02:25:44,077 --> 02:25:45,977
Yes, He does!

1327
02:25:47,280 --> 02:25:52,843
He's completely failed to alert me
to the recent panic in our economy.

1328
02:25:52,952 --> 02:25:55,113
And this......Oh, dear.

1329
02:25:55,255 --> 02:26:01,922
l must have this, Daniel. l must,
l must, l must have this.

1330
02:26:02,061 --> 02:26:04,325
My investments have...

1331
02:26:04,430 --> 02:26:05,950
Daniel, l won't bore you,

1332
02:26:05,950 --> 02:26:09,458
but if l could grab the Lord's
hand for help l would,

1333
02:26:09,569 --> 02:26:12,470
but He does these things
all the time.

1334
02:26:12,572 --> 02:26:16,531
These mysteries that He presents,
and while we wait...

1335
02:26:17,810 --> 02:26:19,971
While we wait for His word!

1336
02:26:20,113 --> 02:26:22,849
Because you're not the chosen
brother, Eli.

1337
02:26:22,849 --> 02:26:23,076
Because you're not the
chosen brother, Eli.

1338
02:26:25,485 --> 02:26:29,285
'Twas Paul who was chosen.

1339
02:26:30,189 --> 02:26:32,325
He found me and told me
about your land.

1340
02:26:32,325 --> 02:26:33,124
You're just a fool.

1341
02:26:33,259 --> 02:26:34,675
Why are you talking about Paul?

1342
02:26:34,675 --> 02:26:36,092
l did what your brother couldn't.

1343
02:26:36,195 --> 02:26:37,457
Don't say this to me.

1344
02:26:37,457 --> 02:26:38,720
l broke you and l beat you.

1345
02:26:39,632 --> 02:26:42,430
lt was Paul told me about you.

1346
02:26:42,568 --> 02:26:45,825
He's the prophet.
He's the smart one.

1347
02:26:45,825 --> 02:26:47,028
He knew what was there

1348
02:26:47,140 --> 02:26:49,506
and he found me to take it
out of the ground.

1349
02:26:49,609 --> 02:26:52,703
Know what the funny thing is?
Listen, listen.

1350
02:26:53,579 --> 02:26:57,481
l paid him $10,000 cash in
hand. Just like that.

1351
02:26:58,518 --> 02:27:01,851
He has his own company now.
Prosperous little business.

1352
02:27:01,954 --> 02:27:05,481
Three wells producing,
$5,000 a week.

1353
02:27:07,560 --> 02:27:11,360
Stop crying, you sniveling ass.
Stop your nonsense.

1354
02:27:12,565 --> 02:27:16,399
You're just the afterbirth,
Eli....No.

1355
02:27:16,502 --> 02:27:19,130
That slithered out
on your mother's filth.

1356
02:27:19,272 --> 02:27:20,603
No.

1357
02:27:20,707 --> 02:27:24,905
They should've put you in a
glass jar on the mantelpiece.

1358
02:27:26,612 --> 02:27:29,979
Where were you when Paul was
suckling at his mother's teat?

1359
02:27:30,116 --> 02:27:31,606
Where were you?

1360
02:27:31,751 --> 02:27:36,450
Who was nursing you, poor Eli?
One of Bandy's sows?

1361
02:27:36,589 --> 02:27:37,700
That land has been had.

1362
02:27:37,700 --> 02:27:39,524
Nothing you can do about it.
lt's gone.

1363
02:27:39,625 --> 02:27:41,786
lf you would just take this
lease......You lose.

1364
02:27:41,928 --> 02:27:45,159
Drainage!

1365
02:27:46,199 --> 02:27:49,760
Drainage, Eli, you boy.

1366
02:27:50,903 --> 02:27:54,040
Drained dry. l'm so sorry.

1367
02:27:55,041 --> 02:27:57,134
lf you have a milkshake

1368
02:27:58,244 --> 02:28:00,007
and l have a milkshake,

1369
02:28:00,113 --> 02:28:01,263
and l have a straw, there it is.

1370
02:28:01,263 --> 02:28:03,310
That's the straw, you see?

1371
02:28:03,416 --> 02:28:04,974
Watch it.

1372
02:28:06,419 --> 02:28:13,348
Now my straw reaches across
the room

1373
02:28:14,627 --> 02:28:17,425
and starts to drink your milkshake.

1374
02:28:18,364 --> 02:28:22,130
l drink your milkshake!

1375
02:28:24,337 --> 02:28:27,795
l drink it up!...Don't bully
me, Daniel.

1376
02:28:30,543 --> 02:28:35,742
Did you think your song and dance and
your superstition would help you, Eli?

1377
02:28:35,882 --> 02:28:40,512
l am the Third Revelation.
l am who the Lord has chosen.

1378
02:28:42,722 --> 02:28:45,020
Daniel!...Because l'm smarter
than you!

1379
02:28:45,124 --> 02:28:46,591
l'm older!

1380
02:28:46,591 --> 02:28:49,258
l'm your old friend, Daniel!

1381
02:28:49,260 --> 02:28:51,900
l'm not a false prophet......
Help me! Help me!

1382
02:28:51,900 --> 02:28:54,162
...you sniveling boy!

1383
02:28:54,267 --> 02:29:00,934
l am the Third Revelation!
l am the Third Revelation!

1384
02:29:01,040 --> 02:29:04,009
l told you l would eat you....
We're family!

1385
02:29:04,143 --> 02:29:05,903
l told you l would eat you up!

1386
02:29:05,903 --> 02:29:08,580
We're brothers! We're brothers!

1387
02:29:15,688 --> 02:29:18,486
Daniel, please forgive me.
l beg you.

1388
02:29:22,161 --> 02:29:24,220
That's it. That's it.

1389
02:30:26,626 --> 02:30:28,093
Mr. Daniel?

1390
02:30:36,002 --> 02:30:37,663
l'm finished.
