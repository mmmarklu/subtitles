He wants to hack Steel Mountain's climate control system,

33
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:13,510
raise the facility's heat high enough to destroy all the tapes.

34
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,450
This is what we're doing.

35
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:16,670
I'll hit up my Dark Army contact as soon as you take off.

36
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:19,910
You just gonna hit up the world's most dangerous hacker crew?

37
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:21,310
He has my bank account, Ollie.

38
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:25,110
We cannot just infect Allsafe's network because of this.

39
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:26,720
I'll lose my job.

40
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,810
Evil Corp's upping their security protocol.

41
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:30,780
They are physically copying then shipping

42
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,410
all the analog backups.

43
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:33,780
We go up today.

44
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,620
I want you to be where you belong:

45
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,030
here with me.

46
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,480
I think I'm happy where I am.

47
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:48,550
Don't let me down, okay?

48
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:50,870
That girl in there is mine.

49
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,120
Did you have something to do with Vera getting busted?

50
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,960
He's on murder charges, do you know that?

51
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:56,720
It's my plan. I'll go in.

52
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,290
You might be able to hide it from these nerds,

53
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:00,330
but I know a junkie when I see one.

54
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:01,620
I'm alone.

55
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,030
No, you're not.

56
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:04,760
I'm not going anywhere, kiddo.

57
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,680
I wish I had better news for you, Fernando,

58
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,990
but this isn't the you're-getting-out meeting.

59
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,710
This is only as much as I could carry.

60
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:37,610
The D.A. has more.

61
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:41,040
How long this gonna be?

62
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,060
We're talking years.

63
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:44,690
Yo, you playing?

64
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,570
You get our people out.

65
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:48,520
That's your use to us.

66
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,160
They have a solid case.

67
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,690
For every charge they're gonna lay on you,

68
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,830
they have these binders, your twitters, your instagram.

69
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:59,520
You said they wouldn't figure this shit out.

70
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,610
They can't, brah.

71
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:02,800
I'm telling you, it was airtight, V.

72
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:05,460
Fellas, this isn't the Imitation Game.

73
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,670
The code here is not that complicated.

74
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,210
Besides, who told you to put your business

75
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,250
anywhere near social media?

76
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,360
My aspirational little brother.

77
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,570
You know how much money we saved last year?

78
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,400
Made our whole operation way more efficient.

79
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,600
We were careful.

80
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,100
You tweeted about every transaction your business was involved in.

81
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,040
That is the opposite of careful.

82
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:30,300
It's no wonder an anonymous tip turned you in.

83
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,030
Who called in the tip?

84
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,090
This is what is meant by anonymous.

85
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,920
It is now spilled milk.

86
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,390
The information got out,

87
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,440
and now they're coming down hard.

88
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,650
There's no plea on the table.

89
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,380
They're gonna lay murder one on you.

90
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,760
I ain't pleading anyway.

91
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,140
Men can't sentence me.

92
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,440
That is a cosmic responsibility.

93
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,770
Someone's gonna get hurt for this.

94
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,000
That's how we get square with the universe.

95
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,500
Fernando, we need to discuss strategy.

96
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,750
You don't want supermax.

97
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,940
Naw, naw.

98
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:06,230
If they lock me up,

99
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:08,380
the kind of door they close don't matter.

100
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,840
So that's you.

101
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,810
That's who you are.

102
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,220
I know you.

103
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:16,530
Excuse me.

104
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,250
Pardon me. Pardon me. I already paid.

105
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,720
Just want to pay my respects.

106
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,890
Thank you. Thank you.

107
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:22,380
Ooh, I'm sorry, man. Sorry.

108
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,150
Just want to pay my compliments.

109
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,940
Hey, excellent coffee, fantastic service.

110
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,530
Buy yourself something nice.

113
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:45,910
Steel Mountain.

114
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,250
We're trying to penetrate a data security facility

115
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,160
whose tagline literally is...

117
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,600
Nothing is actually impenetrable.

118
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,440
A place like this says it is, and it's close,

119
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,570
but people still built this place.

120
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:06,830
And if you can hack the right person,

121
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:07,430
all of a sudden,

122
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,560
you have a piece of powerful malware.

123
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:12,350
People always make the best exploits.

124
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:15,500
I've never found it hard to hack most people.

125
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,440
If you listen to them, watch them,

126
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,520
their vulnerabilities are like

127
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,210
a neon sign screwed into their heads.

128
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:22,890
Mobley's a glutton.

129
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,770
He lacks discipline from his urges.

130
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:26,990
I don't want to get bugs. They spread disease.

131
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,770
Romero is a know-it-all and a hypochondriac.

134
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:31,910
Bill Harper is our first exploit.

135
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,390
He isn't gonna give the search much scrutiny.

136
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,450
He'll get us to Level 1,

137
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:36,120
but Bill is not gonna be able to get us to Level 2.

138
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,060
And we need to get to Level 2.

139
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,780
You're gonna ask to speak to his supervisor, Wendy.

141
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,760
She'll get us to exactly where we need to be.

142
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,130
Then we'll be able to get rid of her from the van.

143
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,210
After that, you connect the Raspberry Pi

144
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:50,000
to the climate control system, and Bob's your uncle.

145
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,440
Now we can hear you, and you can hear us.

146
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:58,930
Mr. Robot?

147
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:01,280
His flaw is he's absolutely insane.

148
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:02,620
We're talking clinical.

149
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:05,240
When they say, "If your friends jump off a bridge, would you?"

150
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,100
He would, without hesitation,

151
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,350
just to prove something.

152
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:10,910
He goes in there, he's liable to blow the whole place up,

153
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,770
just like he wanted to in the first place.

154
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:15,040
Sure you don't want to look over the info and the map again?

155
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,060
I got it.

156
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:19,470
Okay, James Bond, let's go mess their shit up.

157
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:25,460
Yes, I also have security flaws.

158
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,340
I don't like being outside.

159
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:28,750
I liked morphine too much.

160
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,830
Mr. Sepiol?

161
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:31,970
I'm talking to you right now,

162
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:33,510
and you don't exist.

163
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,110
Sam Sepiol?

164
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,840
Sir?

165
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,300
That's you, Elliot.

166
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:41,600
Okay.

167
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:43,670
So sorry you had to wait.

168
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:46,430
As you can see, there's always a lot of bustle here.

169
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:47,630
How can I help you today?

170
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,120
you need a tour. Don't elaborate.

171
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,400
A tour.

172
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,560
Okay.

173
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,020
I'm sure they told you at reception

174
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,650
that we--we require appointments for tours.

175
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:03,710
My supervisor gives us all a hard time about that.

176
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,900
I'm Sam Sepiol.

177
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:08,830
You should look me up.

178
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,030
Okay.

179
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,430
A little inelegant, but we can work with it.

180
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,050
Tell you what.

181
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,870
Have your company call over to new accounts,

182
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,270
and we can set something up later this week.

183
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,670
Ask for Bill Harper.

184
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:22,940
They'll know where to find me.

185
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:23,970
listen, Bill.

186
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,860
You think your boss gives you a hard time now?

187
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,350
You're gonna get a really hard time

188
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,890
right after I walk out of here.

189
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:30,570
I'm not rescheduling, Bill.

190
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:32,580
When I walk out that door, I'm never coming back.

191
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,210
That's your ass, Bill.

192
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,910
I really think you should look me up.

193
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:42,360
It--it just doesn't work like that.

194
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,750
I'm sorry, sir.

195
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:45,840
You take care, okay?

196
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:54,070
I'm coming out. It's not working.

197
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:55,250
It's gonna work.

198
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,220
Hang in there.

199
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,790
I was being too weird.

200
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:59,750
Just like every other tech billionaire.

201
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,860
Slow your roll. It's gonna happen.

202
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:09,300
It's no wonder Wikipedia is never accurate.

204
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,840
Anyone can edit them.

205
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:14,080
Well, not anyone.

206
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,650
Nerds like Mobley built a lot of credit over the years

207
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:18,620
with his 20,000 edits.

209
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,700
And still people trust it,

210
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:24,020
beholden to all the Mobleys of the world for their information.

211
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,190
Mr. Sepiol?

212
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,690
Mr. Sepiol!

213
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,550
I have some good news.

214
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,640
Stop it. Stop it.

215
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,620
Can you stop packing for, like, five minutes?

216
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,250
Can we just hash this out like adults?

217
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,440
I love you.

218
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,490
You don't even know why you're crying.

219
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:42,730
Let's get married.

220
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,510
Ollie, will you please stop?

221
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:48,240
Angela--Angela, you can't just give up on us like this.

222
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,440
I mean, have you even thought this through?

223
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,850
What are you gonna do, go live with your dad in Jersey?

224
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:00,980
Come on.

225
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,130
You're ruining your life.

226
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:05,400
Maybe,

227
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,450
but I also ruined yours.

228
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:11,230
Why do you have my work ID?

229
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:18,960
Did you--

230
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,360
Did you-- do you--do you--

231
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,100
Do you know what's gonna happen?

232
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,740
There will be fallout from this, and I'm gonna tell them--

233
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:33,710
I used your computer, so tell them whatever you want.

234
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,170
Are you serious?

235
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,080
Did you even think about how this would affect me?

236
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:43,650
I did.

237
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,840
Here's an idea of how big this place is.

238
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,680
We have our own fire department, inside the building,

239
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,090
Just for us.

240
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,830
And you can't have a fire department without a fire truck,

241
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,280
and you can't have a fire truck without roads.

242
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:06,040
We have all of that, inside.

243
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:07,600
Imagine that.

246
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:17,820
Elliot, now's the time we get rid of bill.

247
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:20,560
There's so much information...

248
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,960
Okay, we're gonna need to roll up our sleeves here.

249
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:26,450
You have to destroy Bill in order to get to a supervisor.

250
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:29,910
There's one vault in here that's 200,000 square feet.

251
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,520
That's the size of a shopping mall,

252
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,820
and that's just one.

253
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,670
Bill, where are those giant vaults?

254
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:40,350
Oh, they're on level 2, but that's not part of the tour.

255
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,700
Even I don't have authorization.

256
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,400
He's not gonna take you for ice cream.

257
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,900
He has to go away.

258
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,000
There's no place in this plan for Bill.

259
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:50,340
Now, right down here--

260
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,440
Everything okay, sir?

261
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,400
We need to tear Bill down piece by piece.

262
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:59,660
You need to wipe that smile off of his stupid face.

263
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,080
Sir, are you okay?

264
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:04,770
You're not-- you're not saying anything.

265
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:08,580
Dig into him, Elliot.

266
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:17,430
You of all people can do this, Elliot.

267
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:20,150
You know how it feels when someone makes you small.

268
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:22,770
You understand what happens when someone exposes

269
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:24,890
the thing you fear most about yourself.

270
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:25,910
Answer me!

271
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,080
Answer me!

272
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,550
Get up.

273
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:34,250
Just get up!

274
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:36,950
I hate you.

275
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,130
You're nothing.

276
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,500
You're worthless.

277
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,540
Think about it, Bill.

278
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:49,750
Think about what?

279
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:56,700
If you died,

280
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,430
would anyone care?

281
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,110
Would they really care?

282
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,460
Yeah, maybe they'd cry for a day,

283
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,440
but let's be honest.

284
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,940
No one would give a shit.

285
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:13,600
They wouldn't.

286
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,340
The few people that would feel obligated to go to your funeral

287
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,370
would probably be annoyed,

288
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:23,180
and leave as early as possible.

289
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,720
That's who you are.

290
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,370
That's what you are.

291
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:40,830
You're nothing to anyone,

292
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,530
to everyone.

293
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,420
Think about it, Bill.

294
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,830
'cause if you do,

295
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,210
if you let yourself...

296
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,830
You'll know I'm telling you the truth.

297
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,450
So instead of wasting any more of my time,

298
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:05,960
I need you to go call someone that matters,

299
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,470
because, Bill...

300
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,480
You don't.

301
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:18,840
I'll...

302
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:22,740
I'll call my supervisor.

303
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:27,680
And that's why Bill Harper is a perfect exploit,

305
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,180
desperate enough for the business to break protocol

307
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,280
and let me in.

309
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,970
Lonely enough to break.

310
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,170
I need a supervisor in L1-S3.

311
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,650
Copy that.

312
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,430
Don't apologize.

313
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:50,340
You're almost there. You did great.

314
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,200
Once Wendy gets there, we'll send her a text

315
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,410
letting her know her pregnant wife is in labor.

317
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,670
Once she leaves, that should give you enough time

318
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:01,380
to plant the Pi, you dig?

319
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,990
Trudy Davis, Accounts Supervisor.

320
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,250
Is there a problem here?

321
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,930
- Mr. Sepiol is asking... - Trudy?

322
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:11,480
for someone more senior than me.

323
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,030
I don't seem to have your name.

324
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,300
I'm Sam Sepiol?

325
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:20,020
- Is that a question? - Trudy? Trudy?

326
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,050
Where's Wendy?

327
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:22,940
We only prepped for Wendy. Where the hell is Wendy?

328
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:25,070
I need Wendy, actually.

329
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:28,720
And how do you know Wendy? She didn't come in today.

332
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:34,780
What is it that you need, Mr. Sepiol?

333
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,700
I would love a tour of Level 2.

334
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:42,140
I don't know what you've been told,

335
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,910
but we don't allow that.

336
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:46,320
I'll see you out. You can go, Bill.

337
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,730
Follow me to the lobby.

339
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,650
This woman's a ghost.

340
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:57,540
None of these are her.

341
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,180
No Facebook, no LinkedIn.

342
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,870
She's been married for 30 years.

343
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,290
All we have is her husband's cell phone number.

344
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:03,390
He doesn't even have a picture online.

345
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:05,020
No hobbies, no kids,

346
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:08,000
no credit problems, no weird sex stuff.

347
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,350
House paid off.

348
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:11,310
I need-- I need to-- I need to think.

349
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,470
The elevator's almost here.

350
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,500
Yes, that's how they work when you press the button.

351
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:21,790
Okay.

352
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,150
People-- people are all just people, right?

353
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,970
When it gets down to it, everyone's the same.

354
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:27,790
They love something.

355
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,240
They want something. They fear something.

356
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,650
Specifics help, but specifics don't change

357
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:32,090
the way that everyone is vulnerable.

358
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:36,740
It just changes the way that we access those vulnerabilities.

360
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,650
I-I have to go. I'm sorry.

361
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:03,150
I need to go to my office.

362
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,840
Reception will see you out.

363
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:14,880
What'd you do?

364
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,710
I spoofed a text from her husband.

368
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:34,230
It's a palm print scanner.

369
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,330
Get out of there.

370
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,140
There's one door manually locked.

371
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:41,500
It's a fire code thing, and I think you can pick it.

372
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,290
Where?

373
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:45,150
It's at the end of the hallway if you're heading north on L1.

376
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:14,880
The stairs don't go to Level 2.

377
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:16,440
They go to a parking lot.

378
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,850
You're on the complete wrong side of the building.

379
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,210
You're gonna have to double back

380
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:22,720
and go through the door you came in and make a run for it.

381
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,940
Elliot...

382
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:33,770
I thought I saw you.

383
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,220
What are you doing here?

384
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:37,970
Thank you.

385
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:40,180
Y'all come back to Wingstravaganza.

386
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,640
Okay, real important...

387
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,060
Wingstravaganza means wings and extravaganza.

388
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,510
Do you know what extravaganza means?

389
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:46,850
Yep, it's a big deal.

390
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:48,410
You got it.

391
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,680
You look nervous. Are you excited?

392
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:53,460
- Oh, yeah. - Okay.

393
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,900
So you'll shadow me for the week, but don't sweat it.

394
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:57,580
It's like every other server job.

395
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,720
Well, I've actually never been a waitress before.

396
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,640
This is kind of like a new beginning for me.

397
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,430
What were you doing before?

398
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:07,730
Pharmaceutical sales.

399
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:08,830
Fancy.

400
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:11,730
You must have made bank. What happened?

401
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:15,330
Oh, um, just, you know, Obamacare.

402
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:24,520
Welcome to Steel Mountain's data center.

403
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:27,460
Our facility meets diamond specifications

404
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:30,750
and features a tier 10 certified build and design,

405
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:35,810
providing you with a safe, rock-solid fortress for your data needs.

406
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:39,090
All of our facilities implement comprehensive security measures...

407
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:42,460
They say I'm overdoing it, and I say exactly.

408
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:44,580
So yeah.

409
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:45,790
Elliot.

410
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:48,090
- Nice meeting you. - You too.

411
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:50,580
- Tell your wife I said hi. - I will.

412
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:53,940
Those men I just shook hands with,

413
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:56,640
financiers of Hezbollah and ISIS.

414
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,380
I wouldn't stare.

415
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,240
Did he know I was gonna be here?

416
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:02,970
Does he know why I'm here?

417
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,080
Shit, he's gonna kill me.

418
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:06,700
As you were saying?

419
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:10,460
Uh, just a routine data process check.

420
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:12,620
Allsafe does them all the time.

421
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:15,920
But why would they send you?

422
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:17,940
That type of thing isn't usually handled

423
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,560
by the engineers, is it?

424
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,140
We've been overlapping a lot in our duties.

425
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,160
Budget reasons.

426
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:29,820
It seems we both had the idea to work off-site today.

427
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,460
Let's call this fortuitous.

428
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,180
Join me for lunch?

429
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,260
S-sure.

430
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,290
I eat lunch.

431
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,080
So you are like the rest of us.

432
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,580
Come.

433
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,050
He got owned, man.

434
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:53,220
We got to go.

435
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,110
We're not going anywhere.

436
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,620
This changes nothing.

437
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,170
What can I get you, Elliot?

438
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:00,950
Have a lot of things here.

439
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,230
He has a vulnerability.

440
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:04,760
He's an arrogant prick, and he's proud of it.

441
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,810
He cares what you think about him,

442
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,560
even though he probably hates that he does.

443
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,410
Tyrell Wellick's greatest asset is his hubris,

444
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,950
but it's also his flaw, and that's your exploit.

445
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,200
Would be nice.

446
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,210
You eat here?

447
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,180
This place?

448
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,060
Is that your plan, to piss him off?

449
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,520
No, wait, man. Wait.

451
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,080
Now remember, Elliot,

452
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,190
you'll lose our signal on level 2.

453
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:36,580
Elliot.

454
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:41,410
Elliot, say something if you can hear us.

455
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:49,650
I'm impressed you came all the way out here.

456
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:53,240
Allsafe is finished, but you won't let it die.

457
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,280
We're the same.

458
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:57,370
We're perfectionists.

459
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:10,430
I've seen our waiter here for the last... seven years.

460
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,730
Must be in his 50s, maybe has kids,

461
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,360
divorced, second wife, more kids.

462
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,670
And I wonder,

463
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,140
what must he think of himself?

464
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:26,050
His life's potential reached at a 30-grand-a-year salary,

465
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:28,580
an economy car he still owes money on,

466
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,810
two-bedroom apartment,

467
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:33,760
child support, coupons.

468
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,690
I couldn't bear it,

469
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,120
a life like that.

470
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:41,320
The life of an ordinary cockroach

471
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,440
whose biggest value is to serve me salad.

472
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:27,410
I have to go to the bathroom.

473
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:55,490
Goddamn withdrawals again.

474
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:57,100
Or is it Tyrell Wellick?

475
00:22:57,530 --> 00:22:58,720
Is he toying with me?

476
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:00,220
What kind of game are we playing?

477
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,620
Am I his malware?

478
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,380
I had to wash my face.

479
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,520
Hard to breathe...

480
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:01,400
here.

481
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:04,140
I know you framed terry colby.

482
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:07,800
I-I didn't.

483
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,040
Your father worked at Evil Corp before he died.

484
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:11,890
That's a matter of public record.

485
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,220
I'm not turning you in, if that's what you're thinking.

486
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,660
I don't even have proof,

487
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,610
and even if I did, I don't care.

488
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:33,630
Just wanted to know your weakness.

489
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,180
Now I do.

490
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:38,120
Revenge.

491
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:41,900
How ordinary.

492
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:44,670
Just like our waiter.

493
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:47,780
But even extraordinary people,

494
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:49,570
and I believe you are,

495
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:52,370
are driven by human banalities.

496
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:55,010
And unfortunately, we're all human.

497
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,250
Except me, of course.

498
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:02,370
I'm joking, Elliot.

499
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:05,290
Enjoy your long drive back home.

500
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,280
I'm having a helicopter take me back to new york.

501
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:12,300
You take care, Elliot.

512
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:06,240
No. Bullshit.

513
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,950
Dude, bullshit!

514
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,400
- What did they say? - Oh, I don't know.

515
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,710
Basically that they're a bunch of dickless assholes.

516
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:14,410
- Where are you going? - To fix it.

517
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,150
No one else is going to.

518
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:17,980
Darlene, wait.

519
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:24,480
I really don't think you should keep pushing them.

520
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,410
Put it this way.

521
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:27,670
Either I'm fixing this or breaking it.

522
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,380
Their call.

523
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:42,870
Hi, pumpkin.

524
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,340
Hey, daddy.

525
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,730
Why aren't you at work?

526
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:50,810
I broke up with Ollie.

527
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,140
I know.

528
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:54,090
Just got off the phone with him.

529
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:55,830
Come on.

530
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,340
He was sobbing.

531
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,050
He wanted me to tell you something like,

532
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:02,760
"I'll always love you.

533
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:04,130
Please come back."

534
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:07,290
Oh, and he can learn to forgive you.

535
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,120
Jesus.

536
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:12,150
What did you say?

537
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:14,810
I told him I thought you should've broken up with him a long time ago

538
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:15,770
and hung up on him.

539
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:16,910
Nice.

540
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:19,870
What did he mean, anyway?

541
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:25,170
Just normal work and...

542
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,080
money stuff.

543
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:31,970
And, well, he cheated on me,

544
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:34,400
so there's that.

545
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:37,630
Well, the cheating part, I'm not surprised.

546
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,560
Not trying to make you feel bad, honey, but come on.

547
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,960
The kid's a douchebag.

548
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,760
- As for the money... - Dad, no.

549
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,880
I'll float you some money for professional development.

550
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,470
Dad--

551
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:53,730
Call it a loan,

552
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,370
but do not pay me back.

553
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:59,060
And you'll stay here and commute

554
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,690
until you can save for an apartment.

555
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,620
I can't make you do any of that.

556
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:03,620
And you didn't.

557
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,500
It's what I want.

558
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,860
Are you hungry?

559
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,480
- Yeah. - No, no. Sit, sit, sit, sit.

560
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,570
Relax.

561
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:14,120
What would you like?

562
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,530
You don't need to cook for me, dad.

563
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:19,540
French toast coming up!

580
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:35,190
Why are they backing out?

581
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:38,410
This is a library.

582
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:40,840
You want to discuss that, go back to the irc island.

583
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,820
They banned me from the channel!

584
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,480
What happened?

585
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:45,980
We just owned Steel Mountain.

586
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,590
We did our part, and it went perfect.

587
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:49,080
Come on, we both know that shit didn't go perfect.

588
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,350
Well, it doesn't matter! They called it off.

589
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:52,680
We pulled our side together,

590
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,080
and your side called it off like it was nothing.

591
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:56,360
You got your answer.

592
00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:00,470
You better tell your pal WhiteRose to stop being a pussy

593
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:01,970
and start growing a pair

594
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:04,420
because we don't have time to dilly-dally around--

595
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:06,750
And now you're gonna talk about this in the world?

596
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:09,640
Do you even care who hears you?

597
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:12,520
Face it, Darlene.

598
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,520
It's over.

599
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:15,190
Walk away.

600
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:18,670
I can't go back to my people with that.

601
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,530
Tell me why.

602
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:23,650
You said the Dark Army was with us on this.

603
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:29,760
Between us?

604
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:32,130
I'm not about to goddamn tweet about it.

605
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:38,440
They were out before you ever got to Steel Mountain.

606
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,440
I don't know why. That's all they said to me.

607
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,500
I know you had your heart set,

608
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,010
but for real this time,

609
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:49,570
just let it go.

610
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,580
- I need seats mostly. - No.

611
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:14,000
I imagine it must be exciting to work in government.

612
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,420
It's like a spy movie.

613
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,370
Can you read my secret emails?

614
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,850
Mm, no.

615
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,340
My job is mostly paperwork and bureaucracy.

616
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:24,720
They always want more than the technology allows.

617
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:28,220
I don't even have time to read your secret emails.

618
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,350
But it's a stopgap for me.

619
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:31,790
I'm restless.

620
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,910
I'm always itching for something else.

621
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:36,400
There have been a lot of something elses.

622
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,190
For both of us.

623
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:41,850
Before this, I worked at an ngo,

624
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:45,210
and before that, I worked at Microsoft for a year,

625
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:48,070
which felt like a decade.

626
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:54,060
Your place is beautiful.

627
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,790
I wish I could take the compliment.

628
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:58,810
The decorating is Scott's domain.

629
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,060
- Oh, really? - Yes.

630
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,600
- Very nice. - Yeah.

631
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,120
Where's all the-- the antiques from?

632
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,250
They're--

633
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:08,730
So they tapped you for CTO, yes?

634
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,210
Don't be surprised.

635
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:15,860
Suspicious is more accurate.

636
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:18,610
I was beginning to wonder why you set this dinner.

637
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,280
Four people in the world

638
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:25,080
know about my conversations.

639
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:29,120
Somehow you're number five.

640
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,940
Then I'm exactly what you need in a right hand.

641
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:36,310
So that's what this is about.

642
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:38,890
Isn't everything about something?

643
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:41,860
Like, we were thinking about, is it--is it babyproof?

644
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:44,490
Ah, yeah, that's-- that's a consideration.

645
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,230
If you were me,

646
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:49,290
would you trust you as your right hand?

647
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,570
If I were you,

648
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:53,950
I wouldn't have even let me in the house.

649
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:15,900
Hey, it's me.

650
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:17,070
Is now a good time?

651
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,390
Yeah.

652
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,860
I'm at my new job.

653
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:22,350
How's it going?

654
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:25,080
Seriously, it's hard as hell,

655
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,990
but I am getting the hang of it.

656
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,740
At first, it took me, like, years to marry ketchups,

657
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:33,640
but it turns out I'm amazing at upselling expensive cocktails.

658
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:35,850
I'm not surprised.

659
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:38,180
And then when I have to put together to-go orders,

660
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:40,930
it's like bagging molly, so I'm, like, kind of an expert.

661
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:41,940
How are you?

662
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:44,740
I'm good.

663
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:49,580
Wow, I've never heard you say a sentence like that before, ever.

664
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,790
I did what I had to do today.

665
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:56,550
Well, if you're around tonight,

666
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:58,850
come over and tell me about it, okay?

667
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,550
I got to go.

668
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,150
Okay, bye.

669
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,700
You seem to know how to drink your wine.

670
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:23,930
I indulge in few things, but I do love wine.

671
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,630
Yourself?

672
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:28,840
In my other life, when I could drink for one.

673
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,500
But even then I had cheap tastes.

674
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:34,440
It's safe to smell, though.

675
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:35,950
Put your nose in there.

676
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:42,290
You know, to me, it smells like every wine.

677
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:44,740
But I'd love to learn.

678
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:50,690
Dried red fruit, fresh violet,

679
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:53,180
uh, lemon peel.

680
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:55,410
Try it again.

681
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,910
Smell and really-- really think about it.

682
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,840
Mmm, I do smell lemon.

683
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,860
- Sharon? - Yeah?

684
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:08,220
How do you not blow your brains out being married to him?

685
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:10,160
Excuse me?

686
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:12,760
Shall I repeat the question?

687
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:15,870
You're a guest in our house.

688
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:17,910
A very honest one.

689
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:28,110
I think I'll mistake what you said as a joke in poor taste

690
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,120
and excuse myself to the bathroom.

691
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:35,900
I have a beautiful vintage over here.

692
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,880
I would love to just show you the label.

693
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,640
Let's see here.

694
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:46,530
Nope.

695
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:48,860
Nope.

696
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,130
There's the one.

697
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:55,320
This is my prized possession, actually.

698
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,350
Take a look at this.

699
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:01,680
I'm in here.

700
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,300
Can I help you?

701
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:47,500
Thank you for a lovely evening.

702
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:11,290
Siege in stormstout!

703
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,410
Carcass emblem!

704
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,530
We got problems.

705
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:16,960
Is the pi online?

706
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:18,660
Yeah, we're in the whole system.

707
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,860
We could deliver the whole payload right now if we wanted.

708
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,850
And yet I hear no applause.

709
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,040
Applaud.

710
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:31,800
You have to tell them.

711
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:34,780
What?

712
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:36,880
We lost China.

713
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:38,710
I'm sorry?

714
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:40,480
The Dark Army is bailing.

715
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:42,490
Why?

716
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:45,270
They don't answer whys apparently.

717
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,360
That's no problem. We'll just call 'em back.

718
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,010
We'll set up another meet asap--

719
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:50,260
Dude, did you not hear me?

720
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,640
They've gone dark. It's not happening.

721
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:03,140
I know. I know.

722
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:05,250
I get it, okay? I f---ed up.

724
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,120
Let's not wait, then.

725
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:20,880
Let's do it anyway, just us.

726
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:22,390
Let's do it right now.

727
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:24,620
Okay? We execute now.

728
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:26,400
We execute on our side and trust that the Dark Army

729
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,120
gets their shit together and follows.

730
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,590
Why do they get to dictate terms?

731
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:30,900
We dictate terms!

732
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:31,680
We can go now.

733
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,180
If we move forward and they don't,

734
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,370
China still holds all the redundant information.

735
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:36,400
It will be pointless.

736
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,130
And if we wait, it'll also be pointless.

737
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:41,900
Everything you guys did today would be for nothing.

738
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,090
God, are you crazy?

739
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:49,150
It will have no effect!

740
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,190
It'll take down their network for weeks.

741
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:52,170
They'll recover.

742
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:53,230
It would still hurt them.

743
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:54,700
We don't want to hurt them!

744
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,660
We want to kill them!

745
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,540
And neither will happen if we do nothing right now.

746
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:03,430
What are you doing, huh?

747
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:05,600
Take another step, and I'll do it.

748
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:09,830
Think about what you're doing, okay?

749
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:10,930
All right?

750
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:13,190
In a month, they're gonna be up and running again

751
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,750
with even better security.

752
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:16,710
We are not gonna get another shot at this.

753
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,670
The revolution that we've always talked about

754
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:21,360
will be gone, dead, and buried.

755
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:24,710
We will have failed because of you.

756
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:29,080
Please do not do this.

757
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:39,870
Is there anyone here who can communicate with this woman?

758
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,210
Please.

759
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,350
Tell me it's okay to execute.

760
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:30,670
But we were so close.

761
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:41,490
It's not over.

762
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:43,780
We'll rework it.

763
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:45,070
We'll figure something out.

764
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:47,120
We got this far.

765
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,800
We'll find a way, just not tonight.

766
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,400
This is all my fault.

767
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:11,160
Come on.

768
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:13,400
You can crash at my place.

769
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,090
My father picked me up from school one day,

770
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:29,260
and we played hooky and went to the beach.

771
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,000
It was too cold to go in the water,

772
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,440
so we sat on a blanket and ate pizza.

773
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:38,630
When I got home, my sneakers were full of sand,

774
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,910
and I dumped it on my bedroom floor.

775
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,040
I didn't know the difference.

776
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,040
I was six.

777
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:46,850
My mother screamed at me for the mess,

779
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,300
But he wasn't mad.

780
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,400
He said that billions of years ago,

781
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,590
the world shifting and the oceans moving

782
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:54,970
brought that sand to that spot on the beach,

783
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:56,450
and then I took it away.

784
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:58,150
"Every day," He said,

785
00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:00,700
"We change the world," which is a nice thought

793
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:03,260
until I think about how many days and lifetimes

794
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:05,540
I would need to bring a shoe full of sand home

795
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:07,430
until there is no beach,

796
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:09,940
until it made a difference to anyone.

797
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:12,640
Every day, we change the world,

798
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:15,530
but to change the world in a way that means anything,

799
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:17,980
that takes more time than most people have.

800
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:20,090
It never happens all at once.

801
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:23,730
It's slow.

802
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:25,200
It's methodical.

803
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:26,660
It's exhausting.

804
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,780
We don't all have the stomach for it.

805
00:42:56,790 --> 00:42:57,650
Hey, sweetie.

806
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:00,990
I'm gonna go for a run.

807
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:03,730
Nice.

808
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:16,150
Shayla's got the dog.

809
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,410
She doesn't shit on her pillows.

810
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:22,130
That's a plus, I guess.

811
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,000
Shayla?

812
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:39,990
Hey, brah.

813
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:43,990
Sometimes the universe aligns perfectly.

814
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:46,040
Here I am, locked away.

815
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:48,980
Still, it brings you right to me.
