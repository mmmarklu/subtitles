你如何摧毀完全
What to do when a bunch of data you want to destroy

32
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:13,200
不聯網的數據
is completely off the grid?

33
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,680
你好  邪惡公司  我們是去社會
Hello, Evil Corp. We are fsociety.

34
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,190
風云人物  行個屈膝禮吧

黑暗軍團
Dark Army?

36
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:23,780
他們毫無準則  做任何人的雇傭黑客
They got no code. They hack for anyone:

37
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,650
恐怖分子  北朝  伊朗  俄國
terrorists, North Korea, Iran, Russia--

38
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,670

他掌握了我的銀行賬戶  奧利
He has my bank account, Ollie.

41
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:34,260
我們不能為此就感染眾安的網絡
We cannot just infect Allsafe's network because of this.

42
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,240
能說下計劃嗎
Can we please hear the plan?

43
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,010
鋼山那邊現在進展如何
Where are we at with Steel Mountain?

44
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,370
我知道要如何摧毀備份而不必炸管道了
I know how to take out the backups without blowing up the pipeline.

45
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,470
正常人難過的時候會做什么
What do normal people do when they get this sad?

46
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:47,560
大概是去找朋友家人吧
They reach out to friends or family.

47
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:49,900
我嗑嗎啡
I do morphine.

48
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,780
就這些了
There it is.

49
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,590

After all the searching, scraping, dusting,

50
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,190
就剩下這些了
That's all that's left.

51
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,030
一條線  最后的一條
One line. The last line.

52
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,550
此時此刻  是揭發維拉  結識機器人先生
The consequences of busting Vera and meeting Mr. Robot,

53
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:32,900
創造你  以及所有一切的結果
creating you--everything till now, this moment.

54
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:36,760
這是我的選擇  是我選擇了這一切
I chose this. I chose all this.

55
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:43,100
像鋼山這樣的數據存儲中心
Data storage facilities like Steel Mountain--

56
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:46,560
使用LTO-9存儲標準
it's linear-tape open standard 9.

57
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:46,560
{\pos(172,252)}一種磁帶存儲技術

58
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,430
溫度限制在16到35攝氏度
Temp value between 61 and 95.

59
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,140
磁帶上的氧化鐵顆粒
Iron oxide in mag tape--

60
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:54,220
通過粘合劑固定在聚氨酯帶基上
it sticks to polyurethane with a binder.

61
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:05,130
如果室溫超過了35攝氏度上限
If hvac conditions surpass the ceiling 95 degrees,

62
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,060
聚氨酯膠粘劑軟化松脫  數據將無法讀取
polyurethane adhesive mollifies and tape data is unreadable.

63
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,710
這就是我們要做的
This is what we're doing.

64
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,580
將這塊電路板裝在恒溫器后
This circuit board, if installed behind a thermostat,

65
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,040
我們就能植入專用后門
it lets us plant an asymmetric back door

66
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,630
在鋼山的專用網絡上建立一個VPN
then create a VPN in the Steel Mountain intranet.

67
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,560
我們都知道樹莓派[卡式計算機]是什么
Okay, we all know what a Raspberry Pi is.

68
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,790
你想說什么
What's your point?

69
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,100
他想黑進鋼山的氣候控制系統
He wants to hack Steel Mountain's climate control system,

70
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,000
升高整個中心的溫度  毀掉所有磁帶
raise the facility's heat high enough to destroy all the tapes.

71
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,800
你認為把這玩意安在恒溫器后就足夠了嗎
And you think sticking this behind the thermostat will do all that?

72
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,100
只要有專門設計的軟件就行
With the right software specifically designed.

73
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,960
我這就調出我對這個中心的研究
I'll pull up my research on the facility,

74
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,930
看看哪個恒溫器最容易得手
start targeting which thermostats are the most accessible.

75
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,210
你們說得倒挺輕松
Yeah, well, that's all well and good,

76
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,670
但還是得有人進入那破地方
but we still gotta get in the damn joint.

77
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,800
就在這里  在阿迪朗達克山脈深處
There. Deep in the Adirondacks.

78
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,200
占地145英畝以上  以前是一個石灰礦井
In 145-plus acre former limestone mine.

79
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,750
3噸重的鋼制大門  武裝警衛全天候巡邏
3-ton steel gates, 24/7 armed guards,

80
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,890
閉路監控  還有網絡運行中心工作人員
closed circuit cameras, NOC staffing.

81
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,390
真不想直接炸了嗎
Sure you don't want to just blow it up?

82
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:39,340
只要找到一個安保漏洞就行
All we need is one security flaw.

83
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:42,240
你自己看看  就是建成零漏洞的
Look at this place, man. It was built not to have any.

84
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:47,730
我就看到...6個到處走的漏洞
I see about... six walking around.

85
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,820
你還好嗎
You okay, man?

86
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,820
怎么個意思
What the hell?

87
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,330
你要去哪
Where you going?

88
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,940
事說完了  不是嗎
We're done, aren't we?

89
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,930
戒斷反應差不多該出現了
That was about the time the withdrawal started.

90
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,260
記得嗎
Remember?

91
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,010
我知道  我違反了自己的規則
I know--I broke my own rule.

92
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:20,960
但我沒有賽寶松
But I have no suboxone.

93
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:25,270
我只有抑郁癥  社交恐懼癥
What I do have--clinical depression, social anxiety.

94
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,810
白天上班  晚上接著忙  私人關系一團糟
A day job, a night job, confusing relationships.

95
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,380
還有那些指望我的人
Others depending on me.

96
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,740
以及扳倒世界上最大的公司的目標
Taking down the largest corporation in the world.

97
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:35,690
都是我自己選的
And I chose it all.

98
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,760
我這輩子  這條線都在試圖控制我
This line has wanted to own me my whole life.

99
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,690
它們在墨西哥被生物合成出來  制成藥片
Biosynthesized in some lab in Mexico, packed into a pill,

100
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:45,650
再裝箱運到美國  分揀包裝
shipped to the states where it was packaged

101
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:48,040
印上商標  政府再抽稅
with a logo and taxed by the government,

102
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,770
然后被受賄的警衛偷走  賣給了維拉的嘍啰
stolen by a bribed guard, sold to a Vera henchman,

103
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:53,710
倒手給夏拉  然后再賣給我
then oversold to Shayla, and then to me.

104
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:57,070
它需要我  正如我需要它
It needs me just as much as I need it.

105
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,830
這一刻是注定了的  每一個選擇都推動著我
The moment was destined, every choice bringing me

106
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,750
向這條線邁進一步
closer to this one line.

107
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:05,070
這條線  是最后的一條
This line. This last line.

108
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:06,930
我保證
I promise.

109
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,360
今天會是最難受的一天
Today will be the worst of it.

110
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,130
熬過接下來的幾天  我就徹底戒了
Get through the next couple days, and then I'll be clean.

111
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:41,820
你想怎樣
What do you want?

112
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,270
是我  快開門
It's me, open up.

113
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,580
我本不想勞您大駕給我開門
I would have saved you the trip to the door

114
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,640
但你又不希望我闖進來什么的
but you're all, like, against me breaking in or whatever.

115
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,200
你來干什么
Why are you here?

116
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,340
你的小計劃羅梅洛有了新看法
Romero got some clarity on your little plan

117
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,040
需要你親自過去商量
that's gonna need your undivided.

118
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,780
-那好  我們走  -你這是怎么了
- Okay, let's go. - What's going on with you?

119
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,050
看著跟快死了似的
You look like shit.

120
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,120
我沒事
I'm fine.

121
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,580
我跟你說  這個計劃行不通的
Look, man. This plan's not gonna work.

122
00:06:58,130 --> 00:06:59,720
為什么
Why? Why is that?

123
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,500
我對鋼山進行偵查
I was doing recon on Steel Mountain.

124
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,780
發現了個問題  大問題
Came up with a problem. A big, fat one.

125
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,630
邪惡公司正在升級他們的安保協議
Evil Corp's upping their security protocol.

126
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,260
要我說他們有點反應過度  但手段有效
If you ask me, it's overkill, but it's legit.

127
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:13,490
我說過  他們不是無懈可擊
I already told you, they have their vulnerabilities.

128
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:15,940
我們黑了紐約的中心然后怎么辦
So what happens after we hack the New York facility?

129
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,800
然后我們還得去一趟納什維爾
Then we have to take a trip to Nashville,

130
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,000
然后再去科羅拉多  去圣何塞
then Colorado, then San Jose,

131
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:23,150
然后再去該死的塔拉哈西
then goddamn Tallahassee.

132
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,530
這可不妙  大事不妙
Ugh, this looks real bad. Real bad.

133
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,450
他們準備把所有數據的模擬備份
They are physically copying then shipping

134
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,320
復制轉運到各地
all the analog backups.

135
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:34,210
全國各地五個規模極大安保極嚴的后備中心
Five big-ass fortress-like redundancies across the country.

136
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:37,190
假如  我只是說假如
Now maybe--and it was always a big maybe--

137
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,820
我們能成功潛入一個  也不可能都能闖進去
we get into one, but no way we get into all of them.

138
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,730
我們剛剛燒糊了其中一個
The minute we fry one facility,

139
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:44,480
他們就會立即升級其它所有中心的溫控
they'll patch every climate control system they own.

140
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:47,440
不管你用什么手段  這個計劃都行不通
No matter how you slice it, the plan is DOA.

141
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,690
你從哪得到的消息
Where'd you get this?

142
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:50,480
你這話什么意思
What the hell do you mean?

143
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,520
我們還在邪惡公司的網絡里呢
We're still in Evil Corp's network.

144
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,130
該死
Shit.

145
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,840
提利爾說的就是這個
This is what Tyrell was talking about.

146
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,370
你剛說什么
What'd you just say?

147
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,880
提利爾  那個提利爾·威利克
Tyrell? As in Tyrell Wellick?

148
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:05,800
對
Yeah.

149
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,800
你什么時候和邪惡公司的首席技術官
Since when did you and the goddamn CTO

150
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,500
成了好哥們了
of Evil Corp become, what, chums?

151
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:16,350
他說4月1日才會進行升級
Says this isn't happening till April 1st.

152
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,360
今天是29號
It's only the 29th.

153
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,640
我們還有幾天
We still got a few days.

154
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,390
還有時間
We have time.

155
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,290
所有的磁帶還都存在紐約的中心里
All their tapes are still in the New York facility.

156
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:30,310
也就是說  我們今天就得行動
Just means we go up today.

157
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,430
但我們根本沒準備好
We're nowhere close to being ready.

158
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:40,730
我已經下載好了所需的樓層平面圖
Well, I've already downloaded all the necessary PDFs of the floor plans

159
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,380
來定位目標恒溫器
to target the thermostats.

160
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,360
得好好計劃一下
It will require some planning,

161
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,900
但我在車上就能搞定
But nothing I can't do in the car.

162
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:48,190
我應該很快就能控制那里的監控和數據采集網絡
It shouldn't take me long to own the facility's scada network.

163
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,670
尤其有人幫忙的話
Especially with some help.

164
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:51,570
你們去實地
You guys hit the road

165
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:54,480
特倫頓幫我完成軟件部署
while Trenton helps me finish the distro.

166
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,570
我們會加速完成的
We'll double-time it.

167
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,280
你們一到那里就能從FTP服務器上下載了
You can get it off the FTP server as soon as you get there.

168
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,170
中國那邊怎么辦
What about China?

169
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:01,320
周二之前我們就得完成入侵
We'd have to execute the hack before Tuesday.

170
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,210
不用擔心中國那邊
Don't worry about China.

171
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,970
你們一走我就聯系我黑暗軍團的聯絡人
I'll hit up my Dark Army contact as soon as you take off.

172
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,780
你就這樣"聯系"
Oh, you just gonna hit up

173
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,630
世界上最危險的黑客團體嗎
the world's most dangerous hacker crew?

174
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,300
你們是集體失心瘋了
Ya'll have gone and misplaced your collective minds.

175
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,320
這事我們計劃了幾個月了
We've been planning this for months.

176
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:20,870
現在我們就憑他一句話  就說走就走嗎
Now we're gonna go up on a lark just 'cause he said so?

177
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,450
這計劃太爛了
This plan is shit.

178
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,380
這計劃會成功的
The plan will work.

179
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:27,120
等我們到了那里
And once we're actually there,

180
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,200
我還需要準備社交工程I still need to prep the social engineering,

181
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,200
{\pos(232,252)}非技術性入侵  通過社交達到欺騙等目的

182
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,220
而且我們還不知道具體誰進去
plus we have no idea who physically's gonna go in.

183
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:40,390
這是我的計劃  我進去
It's my plan. I'll go in.

184
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:41,990
聽著  伙計  你...
Look, man, you...

185
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,050
你也許能瞞過這些呆子
You might be able to hide it from these nerds,

186
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:47,200
但我一眼就能認出癮君子
but I know a junkie when I see one.

187
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,920
你這種狀態什么也做不了
In your condition, you ain't gonna do Jack or Jill

188
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,280
只會狂吐不止
except puke your brains out

189
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,350
或者給人打飛機  換毒品來爽一把
or give hand jobs for another high.

190
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,340
就像你之前說的
Like you said,

191
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,900
三天之后  一個鋼山就會變成五個
in three days, one Steel Mountain becomes five.

192
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,140
那樣任何計劃都行不通了
That's no good for any plan.

193
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,400
這家伙不太對勁
Something ain't right about this guy.

194
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,520
是啊  但他都領著我們走到這一步了
Yeah, well. He's gotten us this far.

195
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,630
就算這樣  我還是不信任他
Still, I don't trust him.

196
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,790
這和信任無關  記得嗎
Well, it's not about trust, remember?

197
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:20,100
謝謝你  媽媽
Thank you, mom.

198
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,430
-給你  -好的
- There it is. - All right.

199
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,270
到爸爸這兒來
Come to daddy.

200
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,590
伙計
Yo, man.

201
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,820
你不發表下意見嗎
You gonna say anything about this?

202
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:09,860
有什么好說的
What's there to say?

203
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,810
看起來一切都在你掌控之中
You seem to have everything under control.

204
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,420
是啊  好吧
Yeah. Okay.

205
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,650
這不是我的行動
This isn't my operation.

206
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,460
我之前就告訴過你了
I told you before.

207
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,410
你是整件事的關鍵
You're the key to the whole thing.

208
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,810
你是這里唯一的自然之力
You're the only force of nature at play here.

209
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,800
有這么一種說法
There's a saying.

210
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,260
魔鬼最強之時
The devil's at his strongest

211
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,100
就是我們不聞不問之時
while we're looking the other way,

212
00:11:57,390 --> 00:12:00,400
就像我們忙其他事的時候
like a program running in the background silently,

213
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,520
在后臺默默運行的程序
while we're busy doing other shit.

214
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,950
后臺程序  是這么稱呼的
Daemons, they call them.

215
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:09,200
它們無需用戶操作就能運行
They perform action without user interaction.

216
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,240
監視  記錄  通知
Monitoring, logging, notifications.

217
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,430
原始的沖動
Primal urges,

218
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:16,740
被壓抑的記憶
repressed memories,

219
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,460
不自覺的習慣
unconscious habits.

220
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,650
它們一直都在  一直處于活躍狀態
They're always there, always active.

221
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,750
我們可以試著行善
We can try to be right,

222
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,540
我們可以試著做好人
we can try to be good,

223
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,480
我們可以試著發揮影響
we can try to make a difference,

224
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,230
但這都是無用功
but it's all bullshit.

225
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,590
因為意圖是無關緊要的
'Cause intentions are irrelevant.

226
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,600
它們無法驅使我們  后臺程序卻可以
They don't drive us. Daemons do.

227
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:37,550
至于我  我的后臺程序比大部分人都多
And me? I've got more than most.

228
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,340
我只是需要休息一下  我會沒事的
I just need to rest a minute, okay? I'll be fine.

229
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,480
放屁  再過幾個小時
Bullshit--a couple hours,

230
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,370
你只會比現在更難受
you'll wish you felt as shitty as you do right now.

231
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,200
等會兒你驚厥發作
Wait till the convulsions start.

232
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,460
你會全身疼痛  又尿又吐  然后...
Full body pains, leaking from everywhere, then--

233
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,490
會對光線和聲音格外敏感
Hypersensitivity to brightness and sound.

234
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:57,220
再之后是高度妄想
After that, overwhelming paranoia

235
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:59,490
然后就將陷入抑郁的陰霾
followed by the darkest of depressions.

236
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:01,530
這些癥狀可能會持續兩周
Symptoms may persist for two weeks,

237
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,580
如果我能撐那么久的話
assuming I last that long.

238
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,870
我知道等著我的是什么
Yeah, I know what's in store.

239
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:07,900
羅梅洛說得沒錯
Romero may have a point.

240
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,250
你挨過去之前  什么都做不了
You're not gonna be good for anything till you kick this.

241
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,470
燒得慌
I...It burns.

242
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,550
不要生我的氣
Don't be mad at me.

243
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:22,540
我是犯了錯  但我馬上就要改變世界了
I know I slipped, but I'm about to change the world.

244
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,820
我馬上就要改變世界了
I'm about to change the world.

245
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,340
該死
Shit.

246
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:58,370
我就喜歡早上這樣醒來
Mm, that is the way I like to get up in the morning.

247
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:01,560
在床上喝咖啡吃早餐算什么
Screw coffee or breakfast in bed.

248
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,990
如果我每天最先看到的
The first thing I could see every day

249
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,570
是你的性感小屁屁
is that sweet butt of yours.

250
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,720
那我就是這里最幸福的人了
I'd be the happiest dude in the city.

251
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,470
你要出門嗎  寶貝
Are you going somewhere, babe?

252
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:13,430
嗯  我要去和我爸吃早午餐
Yeah, um, I'm gonna meet my dad for brunch.

253
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:14,550
什么  別去啊
What? No, babe.

254
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:16,370
我想帶你去吃早午餐的
I was gonna take you to brunch.

255
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,250
我知道咱倆現在的關系
I mean, I know that things are, like, okay

256
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,350
還算可以  但我不會
between us right now, but I'm--I'm not

257
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:24,980
就這么輕易原諒自己的
gonna let myself off easy, all right?

258
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:27,630
我會一直讓你吃香的喝辣的
You will be wined, and you will be dined

259
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:30,480
直到我覺得自己已經重獲青睞了
until I feel I've gotten myself out of the doghouse.

260
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,350
那咱們今晚去做點什么吧
Well, we can do something tonight, then.

261
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:34,830
很好
Perfect.

262
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,210
-好了  -別嘛
- Okay. - No.

263
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,350
艾略特在嗎  我給他發過短信
Is Elliot around? I tried texting him.

264
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:47,030
但他沒回我
Uh, he didn't text me back.

265
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,040
他今天不在
Yeah, he's gone for the day,

266
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,190
所以我才要照顧小鰭
which is why I'm on Flipper duty.

267
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,070
他去哪了
Where is he?

268
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:54,220
我怎么知道
Shit if I know.

269
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:55,690
我從不過問細節
I mean, I don't ask details,

270
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:58,250
再說他也只會告訴我他想說的
but he only ever tells me what he wants anyway, right?

271
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:01,410
我會告訴他你來過
And I'll tell him you stopped by.

272
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,040
要不要跟我們一起去
Do you want to walk with us?

273
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:13,140
小鰭尿尿的時候最喜歡有人看了
Flipper loves an audience when she pees.

274
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,390
好啊  反正我
Sure. Yeah. I gotta...

275
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,740
也得走回地鐵站
head back towards the subway anyway.

276
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,860
我們從來不計劃路線的
Oh, we don't plan our path.

277
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:26,040
我們都是隨便逛逛  隨心情走
I mean, we just kind of wing it and see where the moment takes us.

278
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:27,670
跟上
Come on.

279
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,970
走啦  要不她要噴發了
Come on, before she bursts.

280
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:38,220
或許這都是有意的
Maybe this was all intentional.

281
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,550
我的潛意識正在后臺運轉
My subconscious, running in the background,

282
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:43,670
使我懷疑我哄別人相信的東西
making me doubt what I got everyone else to believe in.

283
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:47,290
讓我變成自己所懼怕事物的實體體現
Turning me into the physical manifestation of my fear

284
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:47,880
也就是...
of being a...

285
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,570
廢物
Goddamn waste.

286
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:50,960
給他一晚來恢復  好吧
Just give him a night to recover, okay?

287
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,270
-明天也來得及  -這狀態得持續一周
- We still have tomorrow. - This shit'll last a week.

288
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,300
我才不想浪費時間照顧病人
And I refuse to waste my time playing nurse.

289
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,820
我們得回去重新部署  考慮后備計劃
We gotta get back, regroup, start devising a plan b.

290
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,880
兔子進入管理系統了
The rabbit is in the administration system.

291
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,080
-來一劑流感疫苗  -兔子  流感疫苗
- Send a flu shot. - Rabbit, flu shot...

292
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,680
-有人嗎  請回答  -兔子在自我復制
- Someone talk to me. - A rabbit replicates

293
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:10,020
直到文件超載  之后會癌癥一樣傳播
till it overloads a file, then it spreads like cancer.

294
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:10,910
癌癥
Cancer?

295
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,210
好萊塢式的黑客臆想
Hollywood hacker bullshit.

296
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:13,980
我干這行27年了

從來沒遇到過動畫音樂病毒
Not once have I ever come across an animated singing virus.

{\pos(172,252)}《電子世界爭霸戰》

299
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:20,470
我也沒見過特隆城那樣的文件夾結構
I have yet to fly through a Tron city directory structure.

300
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:23,590
我敢打賭  現在肯定有編劇在努力寫一部電視劇
I bet you right now some writer's working hard on a TV show

301
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:26,900
把這一代黑客文化的概念亂搞一通
that'll mess up this generation's idea of hacker culture.

302
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,120
可以直接找我要嘛  小偷
All you had to do is ask, klepto.

303
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,830
我更新了FTP
I've updated the FTP.

304
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:09,390
文件都準備好了
All the files are ready.

305
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:11,600
-我創建了...  -他們有消息嗎
- I've created... - Any word from the road?

306
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,350
天哪  已經足足24小時了
Jesus, it's been a full 24 hours.

307
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:17,220
他們能去哪呢
Where the hell could they be?

308
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:19,980
有止痛藥嗎
Got any Advil?

309
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,380
你沒去聯系中國那邊嘍
I'm guessing you didn't make contact.

310
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:27,790
沒有
Nope.

311
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:30,660
可能這個計劃太大了
Perhaps this plan was a little too ambitious.

312
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,580
我們先等其他人回來
We'll wait until the rest of them get back

313
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,880
然后重新評估情況
and then reevaluate.

314
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,980
無能為力地坐在這兒  等著完蛋嗎
Sitting here helpless while we crash and burn?

315
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,360
不是我的風格
Not my speed.

316
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,660
即使他們黑進了鋼山
Even if they hack into steel mountain,

317
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,360
我們也要同時攻擊中國的數據中心
we need to hit China's data centers simultaneously.

318
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:43,920
如果黑暗軍團不照做
If the Dark Army isn't compliant,

319
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,630
那我們也無能為力
then there's not much we can do.

320
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:51,010
天...該死
God... Shit!

321
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,610
我喝大了  都忘了今天是周日

我知道我的人在哪
I know where my guy will be.

323
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:56,710
這樣好嗎
Is that wise?

324
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:59,340
這些人可不怎么體諒人
Those guys aren't known for being the most understanding.

325
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,060
如果他想聯系我們
I'm assuming if he wanted contact--

326
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,450
現在是我想聯系他們
What about what I want?

327
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:06,810
我跟你一起去
I'm coming with you.

328
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,670
不必了
No, thank you.

329
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:11,760
你待在這兒  等他們上FTP
You stick around, wait for the boys to FTP it.

330
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,080
特倫頓

00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:44,570
-這是什么  -就這最后兩顆了
- What is this? - Come on, they're my last two.

333
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:48,410
是搖頭丸嗎
Is this ecstasy?

334
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:49,900
不是  是"明白藥"
No, it's clarity.

335
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:53,570
能讓你看明白你現在的煩惱
It'll help you see past whatever's bringing you down.

336
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,220
抱歉  我不想無禮
I'm sorry. I don't mean to be rude.

337
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:58,460
但我不吸毒
I...don't do drugs.

338
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,810
我是抽點大麻
I mean, I-I smoke weed--

339
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:03,150
抱歉  但是不能還給我
Well, sorry, but there's no take-backs, so...

340
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:05,920
再說  難道你不想想明白你的心事嗎
Besides, don't you want to figure your shit out?

341
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:10,670
有時候  如果我遇到什么難事
For me, sometimes when I'm going through something,

342
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:12,850
我就...怎么說呢
just gotta--I don't know.

343
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,230
先忘卻它一陣子
Forget about it for a little while.

344
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:58,640
你不是真在喝氣泡水吧
Are you seriously drinking a goddamn sparkling water right now?

345
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:01,590
要不是你系著我的圍巾  我就揍你了
If you weren't wearing my scarf, I'd kick your ass.

346
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:06,900
我們還是走吧
I think we should go.

347
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,910
相信我  他每周日都來這兒
Trust me--he's here every Sunday, okay?

348
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:12,500
他會來的
He'll show.

349
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,800
天啊  羅梅洛  我們該怎么辦
Jesus Christ, Romero. What are we gonna do?

350
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:23,370
我們把他扔到哪家醫院
We dump him at a hospital,

351
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:25,510
再想其他辦法
come up with an alternative course of action.

352
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:26,970
這是我們唯一的選擇
That's our only option.

353
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:28,440
不行  不能去醫院
No. No hospital.

354
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,200
那我們就走人  管他呢
Then we split. Screw it.

355
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,980
你自己也總這么說
I mean, you say it all the time yourself,

356
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,970
每次革命都要流血犧牲
there's casualties in every revolution.

357
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:35,960
只有結果是最重要的
All that matters is the end result.

358
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,660
我們沒時間帶著累贅
We got no time to haul dead weight.

359
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:40,140
好吧  你想走  走吧
Fine! You wanna leave, leave.

360
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,090
去你的
Screw this, man.

361
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,380
我得嗑一發
I need a hit.

362
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:03,930
我會好起來的
I'll be better.

363
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:05,640
讓我挺過去就行
Just to get me through this.

364
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:07,000
我不能讓你那么做
I can't let you do that.

365
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,380
就嗑一發
One hit.

366
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,280
能讓我重新上路就行
You know, just to get me back on the road.

367
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:16,030
我們沒時間了
We don't have time. This...

368
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,890
我們得馬上行動

00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:33,070
來吧
Come on.

371
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,330
走吧
Let's go.

372
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:41,990
打擾一下  伙計
Excuse me, fella.

373
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:43,750
你們在找什么嗎
You lookin' for something?

374
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,420
他需要點幫助
He could really use a helping hand.

375
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,080
好吧  他可以進去  但只能他一人進去
Yeah, okay, he can go in. But only him.

376
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:52,440
不行  我也得進去
Uh, no can do. I gotta come with.

377
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:55,870
除非你也嗑  否則就只有他能進去
Only if you're partaking, otherwise he goes it alone.

378
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:01,620
給你
Here you go.

屋里的人會照顧你的
The guy in the house will set you up right.

382

只要他不殺你的話
Long as he doesn't kill you.

383
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:19,030
聽著  你一嗑完
All right, look, the minute you're done...

384
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:20,670
就馬上走
you leave.

385
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:24,010
你不許看任何人  也不許跟任何人說話
You don't look at anyone. You don't talk to anyone.

386
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,390
你辦完了事  就出來
You take care of business and you get out.

387
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:29,900
明白就點點頭
Nod if you understand.

388
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:01,950
想要嗎
You want?

我都墮落到這個地步了嗎
Have I sunk this low?

403
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:51,080
你會怎么想我啊
What must you think of me?

404

I know I promised my last line, but...

我們會一起走到底
We're in this to the end.

516
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:33,840
你還是好好走路吧  你似乎不太會跳芭蕾
Maybe you should just walk. Ballet seems out of your skill set.

517

再過4小時  我就得去上班了
I have to be at work - in four hours!

535

There's a lot I'm gonna miss about this gig.

536
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,410
你今后要怎么掙錢啊
What are you gonna do for money now?

537
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,840
就是...去做個性感服務員唄

很高興你喜歡
Glad you liked it.

540
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:53,300
不過我很高興打工掙錢之前
Although I am glad I got in one last hurrah

541
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,810
還能再這么玩一次
before going all corporate.

542
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:57,510

擔心什么
Worried about what?

544
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:01,260

00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:04,290
開始新工作之前我總會很擔心
I always get worried before starting a new job.

546
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:07,630
不  我絕對不擔心

547
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:09,680
擔心是浪費時間
Worry's a waste of time.

548
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:12,380
這份工作不合適  我就另找一份
I mean, shit didn't work out at one job, so I got another.

549
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:13,910
就這樣
That's all!

550
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,570
你經常擔心  是吧
You worry a lot, don't you?

551
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:22,610
嗯
Yeah.

552
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,330
看鏡子
Look in the mirror.

553
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,570
看到那個狠角色了嗎
See that badass bitch?

554
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:03,140
她是你這輩子唯一該擔心的人
That's the only person you should ever worry about.

555
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,470
你知道我找你找得多辛苦嗎
Do you know how hard it's been for me to find you?

556
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,280
過來
Come here.

557
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:44,410
你冷靜點
Yo, you need to chill.

558
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,570
去死吧  混蛋
Go to hell, asshole!

559
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:49,370
這才像話
There she is.

560
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:53,450
我黑暗空虛的生活中的一縷陽光
A ray of sunshine in the dark void of my existence.

561
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:54,790
真詩意
Oh, poetic.

562
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:56,540
但這不叫道歉
But not an apology.

563
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,090
我才不想道歉呢
I ain't apologizing for shit.

564
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:01,150
是因為我甩了你嗎
Oh, this is because I dumped your ass.

565
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:04,450
告訴你  你要惹火我了
For real? You're gonna start pissing me off.

566
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:05,930
抱歉我想跟你共度一生
Sorry I wanted to spend my life with you.

567
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:07,390
我真混蛋死了
What a monster I am.

568
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:09,890
有大事要發生了  西斯科
Things are happening, Cisco.

569
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:11,380
我們明天就得行動
We need to go tomorrow.

570
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:13,100
這是唯一的機會
It's our only shot.

571
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,640
那你就沒機會了
Then you never had one.

572
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,620
我說真的  達琳
Look, I'm serious, Darlene.

573
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:19,320
這些人不是鬧著玩的
These guys don't mess around.

574
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,510
不管你以為你在做什么
Now, whatever it is you think you're doing--

575
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:22,600
解放世界  解救眾生
freeing the world, freeing the masses--

576
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,470
雇我的人
the guys I work for,

577
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:26,090
他們的動機可不是那么高尚
they ain't motivated by kumbaya shit like that.

578
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,650
我警告你
All right? Now, I'm warning you...

579
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,050
最后一次警告你
for the last time.

580
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:37,200
得了
Oh, come on.

581
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:58,860
你知道這對我多重要
You know how much this means to me.

582
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,460
求你
Please...

583
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:04,000
跟他們談談
Just talk to them.

584
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,930
我姑媽艾斯特的惡習都用這個治好的
My aunt Esther cured all her habits with this--

585
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:18,680
液體抗腹瀉劑  治你的...那個
liquid anti-diarrheal for the--well, you know.

586
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:21,750
檸檬和鹽補充電解質
Lemon and salt for the electrolytes,

587
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:23,880
解充血藥止鼻涕
decongestant for the runny nose.

588
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,870
這都第三杯了
This is the third one.

589
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:26,610
再來七杯  你就精神煥發了
Seven more, you'll be good as new.

590
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:35,900
我去把車開過來
I'm gonna go pull the van around.

591
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,740
讓他繼續喝
Make sure he keeps chugging those.

592
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:39,880
謝謝
Thanks.

593
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:43,280
不客氣
Cool.

594
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:45,800
又見了
Hello again.

595
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:47,750
好幾沒...
Long time no...

596
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:49,950
做我們做的事了
whatever it is we do.

597
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:53,390
我想你了  你去哪了
I missed you. Where did you go?

598
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:55,720
是你走開了  還是我
Did you leave, or did I?

599
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:08,070
或許我們都走開了
Maybe it was both.

600
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,440
也或者都沒  無所謂了
Or neither. Doesn't matter.

601
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:30,680
那些充滿希望的時刻嚇到我了嗎
Did those hopeful moments scare me?

602
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:34,280
當然了  后臺程序  記得嗎
Of course. Daemons, remember?

603
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:44,150
早晚  會有一項"無需用戶操作程序"
At some point an "action without user interaction"

604
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:46,410
出現  讓我措手不及
will come along and sweep my legs.

605
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:51,660
虛高真低的轉盤會繼續轉動
This spinning wheel of false highs and true lows will continue.

606
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,560
這我確定
That much I know.

607
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:59,100
后臺程序  他們不會停止運轉
Daemons-- they don't stop working.

608
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:00,860
他們總是活躍的
They're always active.

609
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:06,470
他們誘惑  操控
They seduce. They manipulate.

610
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:07,950
他們主宰我們
They own us.

611
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:14,490
盡管你在我身邊
And even though you're with me,

612
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,940
盡管我創造了你  也無所謂
even though I created you, it makes no difference.

613
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:20,080
我們都得獨自面對他們
We all must deal with them alone.

614
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:21,800
我們最多只能期望
The best we can hope for--

615
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:24,520
這一切之中唯一的希望
the only silver lining in all of this--

616
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:26,270
就是我們撐過去時
is that when we break through,

617
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:29,370
會看到有幾個熟人
we find a few familiar faces

618
00:44:29,410 --> 00:44:31,120
在那邊等我們
waiting on the other side.
