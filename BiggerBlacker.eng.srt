Bigger & Blacker

Ladies and gentlemen...

7
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,320
live from the world-famous Apollo Theater...

8
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,520
in Harlem, New York.

9
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,920
Are you ready?

10
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,420
Are you ready?

Please welcome Mr. Chris Rock!

14
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,640
What's up...

15
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,160
New York?

16
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,400
There's Brooklyn in the house.

17
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,280
Well, l'm from Brooklyn.

18
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,520
Shit, look at this. White people are up top tonight.

19
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,240
You know, I was just in my hotel, a little while ago, on my way here...

20
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:42,080
and I got in the elevator, right?

21
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,720
I'm getting in the elevator...

22
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,200
and these two high-school white boys try to get on with me...

23
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,640
and l just dove off.

24
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,480
I said, "Y'all ain't killing me!"

25
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,560
I am scared of young white boys.

26
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,440
If you white and under 21, I am running for the hills.

27
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,880
What the hell is wrong with these white kids shooting up the school?

28
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,040
They don't even wait till 3:00, either.

29
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,120
Killing people in the morning. That ain't right.

30
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,360
The Trench Coat Mafia.

31
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,520
"No one will play with us."

32
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,720
"We have no friends. We're the Trenchcoat Mafia."

33
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,160
Hey, I saw the yearbook pictures. It was six of them.

34
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,320
I didn't have six friends in high school.

35
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,000
I don't got six friends now.

36
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,800
Shit, that's three-on-three with a half court.

37
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,200
What the hell is wrong with these kids?

38
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,120
I got people telling me, "Come on, Chris. Come up to a school. Talk to the kids."

39
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,240
I'm like, "Fuck the kids!

40
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,960
"Do you got a vest? Maybe I'll think about it."

41
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,960
Everybody wants to know what the kids was listening to.

42
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,760
What kind of music was they listening to?

43
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,760
Or what kind of movies was they watching?

44
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,600
Who gives a fuck what they was watching?

45
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,280
Whatever happened to crazy?

46
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,240
What happened to crazy? What, you can't be crazy no more?

47
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,800
Did we eliminate "crazy" from the dictionary?

48
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,920
Fuck the records. Fuck the movies. Crazy!

49
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,920
When I was a kid, they used to separate the crazy kids from everybody.

50
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,080
When I was a kid, the crazy kids went to school in a little-ass bus.

51
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,600
They had a class at the end of the school...

52
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,240
and they used to get out of school at 2:30.

53
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,680
Just in case they went crazy...

54
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,320
they would only hurt other crazy kids.

55
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,240
And we was all safe.

56
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,520
We was all safe. Damn, the world's coming to an end.

57
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,760
You'll have little white kids saying,

58
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,600
"I want to go to a black school where it's safe."

59
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,040
That's right, man.

60
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:31,840
And everybody's talking about gun control, got to get rid of the guns.

61
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,080
Fuck that. I like guns.

62
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,000
You got a gun, you don't have to work out.

63
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,040
I ain't working out. I ain't jogging.

64
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,240
You got pecs, I got Tecs.

65
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,880
Fuck that shit. You don't need no gun control.

66
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,040
You know what you need? We need some bullet control.

67
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,200
Man, we need to control the bullets, that's right.

68
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,560
I think all bullets should cost $5,000.

69
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,760
$5,000 for a bullet. You know why?

70
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:07,440
'Cause if a bullet costs $5,000, there'd be no more innocent bystanders.

71
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,960
That'd be it.

72
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,600
Every time someone gets shot, people will be like, "Damn, he must have did something."

73
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:24,120
"Shit, they put $50,000 worth of bullets in his ass."

74
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,120
People would think before they killed somebody, if a bullet cost $5,000.

75
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,200
"Man, I would blow your fucking head off, if I could afford it."

76
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,520
"I'm gonna get me another job, I'm gonna start saving some money..."

77
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,600
"and you're a dead man."

78
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,960
"You better hope I can't get no bullets on layaway."

79
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,880
So even if you get shot by a stray bullet...

80
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,440
you won't have to go to no doctor to get it taken out.

81
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,160
Whoever shot you would take their bullet back.

82
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,360
"I believe you got my property."

83
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,480
That's right, man.

84
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,920
See, everybody blames the kids as fucking crazy.

85
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,080
Everybody wants to be mad at the kids for shooting up the school.

86
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,240
What about the parents? The parents.

87
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,600
The parents is really fucked up, man.

88
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:27,600
Their damn parents need to go to jail for some of this fucking shit, man.

89
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,280
Cause everybody knows that crazy-ass kid that went to jail.

90
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,800
You go, "Man, he ain't never had a chance."

91
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,760
"If you'd known his mama, you'd know he gonna be there."

92
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,600
I was at the club the other night, down at Life, chilling at the club.

93
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,920
I'm chilling with this girl. She was dancing.

94
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,960
It was about 2:00 a.m. I'm talking to her, and realized she had two kids at home.

95
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,800
I don't mind the two kids at home, that's all good.

96
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,720
But I'm like, "What the fuck are you doing in a club..."

97
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,640
"at 2:00 in the fucking morning on a Wednesday night?"

98
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,160
"What the fuck are you doing here?"

99
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,880
"Is it your birthday?"

100
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,040
"Did you get a raise?"

101
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,720
"Well, you got to get the fuck out."

102
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,560
"You go. I'm kicking you the fuck out. Yes, bye!"

103
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,640
"Go take care of them kids before they rob me in 10 years."

104
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,720
You got to get your kid on or your groove on.

105
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,280
You can't get both on at the same time. I'm tired of this shit.

106
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,400
And a bunch of girls are like:

107
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,720
"You don't need no man to help you raise no child."

108
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,280
Shut the fuck up with the bullshit.

109
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:44,120
Yeah, you can do it without a man but that don't mean it's to be done.

110
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,960
Shit, you could drive a car with your feet if you want to.

111
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,160
That don't make it a good fucking idea.

112
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,720
I don't give a fuck. You could be the baddest mama on earth.

113
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,960
I don't give a fuck how good you are.

114
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,080
Ain't nothing you can say more powerful than, "I'm gonna tell your daddy."

115
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,680
Can't fuck with it.

116
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,120
Can't come close to, "I'm gonna tell your daddy."

117
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,760
You can have a gun at the kid's head, "I'll blow your fucking head off."

118
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,560
- "So what?"  - "I'll tell your daddy."

119
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,080
"Okay, okay."

120
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,360
Can't fuck with it, man.

121
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,160
I'm tired of bumping into these girls at the club...

122
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,360
all late on a fucking weeknight.

123
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,800
I got a little cousin who got left back in the first grade.

124
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,480
Left back in the first grade...

125
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,280
cause his mama's out getting the groove on.

126
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,040
You know how dumb you got to be...

127
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,840
to get left back in the first grade?

128
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,560
- "What's four plus four?"  - "Jell-O."

129
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,800
But that ain't his fault. That's the mama's fault.

130
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,840
That's the mama's fucking fault. That's right.

131
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:06,120
I'm telling my cousin, "Tina, talk to your fucking kid."

132
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,560
"Talk to him, teach him some shit."

133
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,000
"If you said more words to him than,'Mommy be back'..."

134
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,040
"he might know something."

135
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,160
That's right.

136
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,160
And it's real easy to tell who kids are gonna be fucked up.

137
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,200
It don't take no scientist to tell who's gonna have some fucked-up kids.

138
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,360
If the kid calls his grandmamma "Mommy"...

139
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,160
and his mama "Pam," he's going to jail.

140
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:48,440
You ain't saving no college money, you saving bail money.

141
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,760
That money's going to Johnnie Cochran.

142
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:57,200
That's right. If the kid can't read, that's Mama's fault.

143
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,240
That is Mama's fucking fault.

144
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,560
Now, if the kid can't read cause there ain't no lights in the house...

145
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,480
that's Daddy's fault.

146
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,200
You got this shit down?

147
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,600
See, nobody gives a fuck about Daddy. There's some real daddies out there.

148
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,280
I'm not talking about the guy that fucked you and left.

149
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,720
Fuck him, okay? I'm talking about the real daddies.

150
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,360
There's still some motherfuckers out there that handle their business.

151
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,560
Motherfuckers wanna act like brothers...

152
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,160
There's some brothers that handle their business.

153
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,440
Cause people don't give a fuck... Nobody gives a fuck about Daddy.

154
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:44,440
Everybody takes Daddy for granted. Just listen to the radio.

155
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:48,400
Everything's "Mama. Dear Mama. Always loved my Mama."

156
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,880
What's the Daddy song? Papa was a Rollin' Stone.

157
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,880


158
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,880
Nobody gives a fuck. Nobody appreciates Daddy.

159
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,800
Now, Mama's got the roughest job. I ain't gonna front.

160
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,520
But at least people appreciate Mama.

161
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,960
Every time Mama do something right, Mama gets a compliment...

162
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,640
cause women need to hear compliments all the time.

163
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,920
Women need food, water, and compliments.

164
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,600
That's right.

165
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,320
And an occasional pair of shoes.

166
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,480
That's right. Women got to hear it all the time, or they lose their minds.

167
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,400
And get Daddy to make sure you thank your mama for everything.

168
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,920
"Tell your mama how good the food is. Tell her how nice the house looks."

169
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,760
"Tell your mama how nice her hair looks."

170
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,400
"Did you tell your mama? You better go in there and tell your mama."

171
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,440
That's right! "Tell your mama."

172
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,480
Nobody ever tells Daddy shit.

173
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,600
I'm talking about the real daddies that handle their fucking business.

174
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,760
Nobody ever says, "Hey, Daddy, thanks for knocking out this rent."

175
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,720
"Hey, Daddy, I sure love this hot water."

176
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:11,160
"Hey, Daddy, this is easy to read with all this light."

177
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,640
Nobody gives a fuck about Daddy.

178
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,360
I'm talking about a daddy that handles his business. Nobody gives a fuck about Daddy.

179
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,800
Think about everything that the real daddy does:

180
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,800
pay the bills, buy the food, put a fucking roof over your head.

181
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,000
Everything you could ever ask for.

182
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,760
Make your world a better, safer place.

183
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,640
And what does Daddy get for all his work?

184
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,920
The big piece of chicken. That's all Daddy gets...

185
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,120
is the big piece of chicken.

186
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:51,040
That's right. And some women don't want to give up the big piece of chicken.

187
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,400
"Who the fuck is you..."

188
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,120
"to keep the big piece of chicken?'

189
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,160
"How dare you keep the big piece of chicken!"

190
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:05,000
A man can't work 12 hours and come home to a wing.

191
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,080
When I was a kid, my mama would lose her mind...

192
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,240
if one of us ate the big piece of chicken by accident.

193
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,360
"What the fuck! You ate the big piece of chicken?"

194
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,400
"Oh, Lord! No, no."

195
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,680
"Now I got to take some chicken and sew it up and shit."

196
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,920
"Get me two wings and a pork chop. Daddy'll never know the difference."

197
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,840
Just can't do it. Can't do it.

198
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,040
I don't know, man. The world's nuts. It's all good for Clinton.

199
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,360
Any time something bad happens, it's good for Bill Clinton.

200
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,640
Just gets people off his ass.

201
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:51,360
"Stop thinking about me. Good. Kids got shot. Good."

202
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,440
"Good. People are not thinking about me."

203
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,560
"Tornadoes. Good."

204
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,360
"People ain't thinking about me."

205
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,280
Clinton damn near got impeached, for what?

206
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,760
For what?

207
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:07,920
Lied about a blowjob so his wife wouldn't find out.

208
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,040
Is that against the law?

209
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,560
Do you need the Supreme Court for that one?

210
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,200
You could have took that one to The People's Court!

211
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,720
Could have took that one to Judge Judy.

212
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,840
She'd have knocked it out in a half hour, plus commercials.

213
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,200
What the fuck did Clinton do?

214
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:43,120
They was charging him with shit I didn't even know was crimes.

215
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,920
"You got her some gifts." So what he got her gifts? That's his friend.

216
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,440
You can't buy your friend a gift?

217
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,680
"Tried to get her a job." You can't get your friend a job?

218
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,480
Shit, 80% of the people in this room got their job...

219
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,000
because a friend recommended them.

220
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:08,160
It's against the law to get your friend a job?

221
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,200
Shit, she blew him for a couple of months.

222
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,600
The least he could do is give her a recommendation!

223
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,600
It's the least he could do.

224
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,920
See, people...

225
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,040
everybody expects this holy behavior cause he's the President.

226
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,600
Expect him to behave this holy way.

227
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,600
He's just the President. He ain't Rev. Clinton.

228
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,280
It ain't Pastor Clinton. It ain't Maharajah Clinton.

229
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,960
It is just Bill Clinton. He's just a man. A man's gonna be a man.

230
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,440
A man is basically as faithful as his options.

231
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,840
That's how faithful a man is, no more, no less.

232
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,000
You see all these fat Republican guys going,

233
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,520
"I would never do such a thing. This is a travesty."

234
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,400
I'm like, "Nobody's trying to blow you."

235
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:16,200
Ain't no 20-year-old girls trying to blow Orrin Hatch.

236
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,800
Ain't nobody trying to give Newt Gingrich some.

237
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,040
I don't give a fuck, you ain't never gonna hear Newt Gingrich go,

238
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:27,120
"Man, I wish these hoes would back up off me."

239
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:32,280
"I wish they would just back the fuck up off me."

240
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,360
Let a player play, shit!

241
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,880
That's right.

242
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,080
It's damn near impossible for a man to turn down sex.

243
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,000
It's hard for a man to turn down sex.

244
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:49,280
We can stop chasing it, and even that requires some rehab.

245
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,480
But it's hard for a man to stop.

246
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,920
If it chase us, we can't run that fast.

247
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,760
It's gonna catch us, we're like,

248
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:04,120
"Shit, pulled a hamstring. You got me."

249
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,480
You can't run that fast.

250
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,520
See, it's easy for women to turn down sex. It ain't shit for y'all to turn down sex.

251
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,560
It ain't no thing for y'all to turn down sex.

252
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:19,800
Y'all like, "Why can't you turn it down? I do it all the time."

253
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:23,880
"Why can't you say no? I say no." See, it's easy for y'all. You know why?

254
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,560
Cause every woman in here, ever since you were 13...

255
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,600
every guy you met has been trying to fuck you.

256
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:37,160
That's right. Women are offered dick every day.

257
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,200
Every woman in here...

258
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,440
gets offered dick at least three times a week.

259
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,520
Three times a day, shit!

260
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:52,320
That's right, every time a man's being nice to you...

261
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,600
all he's doing is offering dick. That's all it is.

262
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:03,520
"Can I get that for you? How about some dick?"

263
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,840
"Could I help you with that? Could I help you to some dick?"

264
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,880
"Do you need some dick?"

265
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,200
Nobody offers us shit.

266
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,160
We got to fend for ourselves.

267
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,560
We can't believe it when we get an offer. We're like, "Damn, this is my lucky day."

268
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,360
That's right, man.

269
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,240
See, this whole Monica Lewinsky scandal, a lot of this shit is Hillary's fault.

270
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,200
That's right, I said it.

271
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,360
I said it. It had to be said. Somebody got to say it.

272
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:49,840
Everybody's like, "Hillary's a hero." No, she ain't.

273
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,800
Aquaman's a hero.

274
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,680
He can talk to the fishes. What the fuck can Hillary do?

275
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,640
A lot of this shit is Hillary's fault, cause, ladies, you know your man.

276
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,840
You know your man better than he knows himself.

277
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,080
You know what kind of man you got.

278
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:17,920
You know if you got the crazy, need-a-blowjob-all-the-time man.

279
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:23,800
So sometimes you gotta save your man from himself.

280
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,520
So you know what happens if he don't get his medicine.

281
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,040
So Hillary Clinton put us all in danger.

282
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,520
She put the security of the free world in jeopardy...

283
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,560
and she needs to suffer the consequences for her actions.

284
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,040
That's right, she's the First Lady.

285
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:54,040
She's supposed to be the first one on her knees to suck his dick!

286
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,720
Shit!

287
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,960
That's right. Monica Lewinsky shouldn't have even stood a chance.

288
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:14,000
Hillary's supposed to already be down there like, "Hey, I got it."

289
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,000
"I've got it. I got the dick."

290
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,320
"Tickle his ass, or something."

291
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,040
"Yeah, grab a ball, make yourself useful."

292
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,600
And they always been on Clinton.

293
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,080
Before any of this happened, they was on Clinton.

294
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,560
What was they on him for?

295
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,160
Gays in the military. Everybody says, "Don't let them in."

296
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,040
If they wanna fight, let them fight, cause I ain't fighting.

297
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:54,520
I wouldn't give a fuck if I saw a Russian tank rolling down Flatbush Avenue.

298
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,000
I ain't shooting nobody. So call me a faggot.

299
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,840
When the war is over, I'll be the faggot with two legs, thank you.

300
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,480
You know what's fucked up? Everybody gets so homophobic.

301
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,600
People, we need to cut that shit out...

302
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:16,400
cause everybody in this room got at least a gay cousin.

303
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,640
Every last one of you got a gay cousin.

304
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,400
You knew he was gay when y'all was kids.

305
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,320
You was playing ball, he was jumping rope.

306
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:33,040
He didn't turn gay, he was gay then. He just didn't have nobody to be gay with.

307
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,960
Shit, I got a gay uncle. Call him Aunt Tom.

308
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,320
Every Christmas, he comes over with his "friend."

309
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,720
See, it don't make no sense to hate nobody.

310
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:54,400
It don't make no sense to be a racist, sexist, or nothing, but... It don't.

311
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,560
It doesn't.

312
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,880
It don't make no sense...

313
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,240
cause whoever you hate will end up in your family.

314
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,040
That's right, you don't like gays, you're gonna have a gay son.

315
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,640
You don't like Puerto Ricans?

316
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,320
Your daughter's gonna come home with "Livin' la vida loca!"

317
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,480
Don't you just love that shit?

318
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,600
That's a catchy-ass song.

319
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:32,720
You just want to jump up on shit. "Livin' la vida loca!

320
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,520
"Come on!"

321
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:45,880
I feel that shit. I'll be driving, "Livin' la vida loca!"

322
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,360
I love that shit.

323
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,080
That ain't going nowhere. That's gonna be out a long time.

324
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:55,800
That shit is like the Puerto Rican Whoomp! (There It Is)!

325
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,880
I was talking about my gay uncle.

326
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,520
See, your uncles prepare you for life.

327
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,200
If you got enough uncles, they'll prepare you for life...

328
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,440
cause you got every type of uncle.

329
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:12,920
You got your gay uncle, you got your alcoholic uncle.

330
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,240
You got your stealing uncle.

331
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,440
You got your molester uncle.

332
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,400
Everybody's got that one molester uncle.

333
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,440
Your mama's like, "Where them kids at?"

334
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,080
- "They're with Johnny."  - "Get them kids!"

335
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:35,240
"Hurry up, get them kids! Don't leave them with your Uncle Johnny!"

336
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,760
Later on, you get molested, your mama get mad at you.

337
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,320
"That's what you get."

338
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,640
"Hanging around fucking Johnny. I told you about that shit!

339
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,440
"Now walk it off!"

340
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,920
That's your family.

341
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,840
I don't know. Let's talk about Clinton.

342
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:09,720
One thing Clinton did I didn't like, raise taxes. Taxes all high and shit.

343
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,680
You know what's fucked-up about taxes?

344
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,520
You don't even pay taxes. They take tax.

345
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,040
You get your check, money gone.

346
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,120
That ain't a payment, that's a jack.

347
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,880
Got all these taxes: city tax, state tax, Social Security tax.

348
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,440
You don't get the money until you're 65.

349
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,680
Meanwhile, the average black man dies at 54.

350
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:38,400
Shit, we should get Social Security at 29!

351
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,720
What the fuck, man? We don't live that long.

352
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:51,960
Hypertension, high blood pressure, NYPD, something will get you.

353
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,880
What the fuck is up with the police? My God!

354
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:10,240
I am scared. I didn't get rid of no guns. Fuck that shit.

355
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,320
And I had a cop pull me over the other day, scared me so bad...

356
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,080
made me think I stole my own car.

357
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,680
"Get out the car, get out the fucking car! You stole this car!"

358
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,960
I'm like, "Damn, maybe I did."

359
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,960
"Oh, Lord, I done stole a car."

360
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:33,040
You know what's worse than taxes? What's worse than tax is insurance.

361
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,400
You got to have some insurance.

362
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:41,360
They shouldn't even call it insurance. They just should call it "in case shit."

363
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,560
I give a company some money in case shit happens.

364
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:50,840
Now, if shit don't happen, shouldn't I get my money back?

365
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:04,440
That's right, man, you better have some medical insurance, or you gonna die.

366
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,440
That's right, everybody. You got to eat right and exercise.

367
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,120
No, you don't, you need some coverage.

368
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,280
Coverage will save your life.

369
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:15,800
That's right, we all gonna die, but at least if you got some coverage...

370
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,960
you will die on a mattress.

371
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,440
That's right. When I was a kid, we didn't have no insurance.

372
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,440
We didn't have a damn thing.

373
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:27,560
You had to be damn near dead to see the doctor.

374
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,120
You had to be way past Robitussin.

375
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,320
That's all we had when I was a kid: Robitussin.

376
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,680
No matter what you got, Robitussin better handle it.

377
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,560
- "Daddy, I got asthma."  - "Robitussin."

378
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,600
- "I got cancer."  - "Robitussin."

379
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:47,040
I broke my leg, Daddy poured Robitussin on it.

380
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,280
"Yeah, boy, let that 'tussin get in there.

381
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,000
"Yeah, boy, let that 'tussin get on down to the bone.

382
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,560
"The 'tussin ought to straighten out the bone. It's good.

383
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:03,680
"If you run out of 'tussin, put some water in the jar, shake it up, more 'tussin.

384
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,160
"More 'tussin!"

385
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:12,400
Y'all like doctors 'cause they don't cure shit.

386
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,480
They don't cure nothing.

387
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,560
Same diseases been hanging out since I was a kid, man.

388
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,520
What's the last shit a doctor cured? Polio.

389
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,960
You know how long ago polio was?

390
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,640
That's like the first season of Lucy.

391
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,680
Shit, Fred had an Afro with finger waves!

392
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,640
Have you ever met anybody with polio?

393
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,040
Anybody feel a little 'poly around you?

394
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,800
No. That's right, they don't cure shit.

395
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,240
The same diseases been hanging out since I was a kid:

396
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,920
AlDS, sickle cell, tuberculosis, cancer, Jerry's kids still limping around.

397
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,640
I've been watching the Jerry Lewis Telethon...

398
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,360
for probably about 15 or 16 years now.

399
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:56,120
Not one stitch of progress whatsoever.

400
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,520
Come on, man. Lie to me, Jerry!

401
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,520
What the fuck you doing, Jerry?

402
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,120
Put a stick in the kid's back, prop him up or some shit!

403
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,720
Come on, call Steven Spielberg.

404
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,280
Get some special effects on this shit!

405
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,560
Get George Lucas on the case!

406
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,600
CGI, motherfucker!

407
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,080
What the fuck!

408
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:24,760
Tie some string around him, make a cripple puppet or some shit.

409
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,160
Lie to me!

410
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,120
Where the fuck's the money going?

411
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,520
What, to keep Jerry's hair black?

412
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,760
Where's the money going? Think about it.

413
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,040
Frank Sinatra: dead. Dean Martin: dead. Sammy Davis: dead.

414
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,920
Jerry Lewis got a full head of black hair.

415
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:52,040
And if you ain't gonna cure the disease, cut the kids a check!

416
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:58,000
That's right, you know the little boy who's getting ready to die? Get him a table dance.

417
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,880
Get him a table dance, for Christ's sake!

418
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:11,640
I'm sure the Make-A-Wish people hear that request every now and then.

419
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,320
Get the boy a table dance.

420
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,320
"What do you want, Jimmy? You're dying. Wanna meet Jim Carrey?"

421
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,160
"No, I want some big titties in my face."

422
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,080
"It's my last wish, come on."

423
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,360
That's right, man.

424
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,120
That's right, we got AlDS out there. You think they're gonna cure AIDS?

425
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,960
No, they can't even cure athlete's foot.

426
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,960
They ain't curing AIDS. Shit, they ain't never curing AIDS.

427
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,200
Don't even think about that shit.

428
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:48,120
They ain't curing it, cause there ain't no money in the cure.

429
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:52,480
The money's in the medicine. That's how you get paid, on the comeback.

430
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:57,280
That's how a drug dealer makes his money, on the comeback.

431
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,880
That's all the government is:

432
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,560
a bunch of motherfucking drug dealers, on the comeback.

433
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,680
They ain't curing no AlDS.

434
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,320
That's all it is.

435
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,480
You think they're gonna cure AIDS?

436
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:15,000
They're still mad at all the money they lost on polio!

437
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:20,360
Curing AIDS? Shit, that's like Cadillac making a car that lasts for 50 years.

438
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,400
And you know they can do it...

439
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,160
but they ain't gonna do nothing that fucking dumb.

440
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,720
Shit, they got metal on the space shuttle that can go around the moon...

441
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,920
and withstand temperatures of up to 20,000 degrees.

442
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
You mean to tell me you don't think they can make an Eldorado...

443
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,800
where the fucking bumper don't fall off?

444
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,200
They can, but they won't.

445
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:49,600
So what they will do with AIDS is the same thing they do with everything else.

446
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,760
They will figure out a way for you to live with it.

447
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,760
They don't cure shit, they just patch it up.

448
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,960
Get you to the next stop, so they can get more of your money.

449
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,520
They ain't gonna cure it.

450
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,040
Hopefully, in our lifetime, you're gonna see somebody go:

451
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,640
"Yo, man, you weren't at work yesterday. What's up?"

452
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,600
"My AIDS is acting up.

453
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:14,360
"You know, when the weather get like this, my AIDS just pop up."

454
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:17,280
"But I took some Robitussin. I'm fine now!"

455
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,240
That's right, man. AIDS is scary, man.

456
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:28,560
I took my AIDS test, passed it, got 65.

457
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,480
You know what's scary about the AIDS test?

458
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:39,640
What's scary is you don't get the results back for five days.

459
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,680
Five days, that's a long time.

460
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:46,880
And you know what happens in those five days? You start reflecting.

461
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:52,000
You start thinking about every nasty, skank-ass...

462
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:55,600
questionable piece of sex you ever had...

463
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,560
and everybody got a few.

464
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,040
And you're like, "God, what the fuck was I thinking?"

465
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:07,040
"1993. She didn't even have teeth!"

466
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,400
"Oh, God!"

467
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,920
"What the fuck was on my mind?"

468
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:16,040
It's like the movie Scrooge, and the Ghost of Pussy Past comes.

469
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,600
"Remember me? I'm Itchy, the stripper from Miami."

470
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,880
You know what else happens after you take an AIDS test?

471
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,280
You start calling up people to see if they're alive.

472
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,960
- Hello, can I speak to Lisa?  - This is Lisa.

473
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,560
- Hello, can I speak to Tammy?  - Tammy dead.

474
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,280
"What happened?"

475
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,200
"She got hit by a bus."

476
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,400
"Thank the Lord! Yes!"

477
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,560
"Go Greyhound!"

478
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,360
"Yeah, she got hit by a bus!"

479
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,600
"Livin' la vida loca!"

480
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:28,160
At least they're still working on AIDS. At least they're trying to get rid of AIDS.

481
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,400
Some diseases, they just gave up on.

482
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:34,000
There's some diseases, if you get them, you on your own.

483
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:37,040
They ain't gonna have no telethon for you...

484
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,440
R. Kelly ain't singing no song.

485
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,840
You just got this shit, that's right.

486
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,160
You get paralyzed, they don't got shit for you.

487
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,360
Look at Christopher Reeve, paralyzed.

488
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,400
Superman can't walk. What kind of sorry-ass shit is that?

489
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:55,400
Superman can't walk. What's next? What the fuck!

490
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,760
Aquaman gonna drown in the tub?

491
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:02,040
What the fuck kind of injustice is this?

492
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,040
Superman can't walk.

493
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,920
The Hulk gonna get the gout? What the fuck!

494
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,520
Superman can't walk.

495
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:13,040
Now you go tell a doctor you paralyzed, they don't got shit for you.

496
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,840
"Doc, I'm paralyzed. What you got?"

497
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:18,720
"Why don't you take this chair and roll your ass around town?"

498
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,080
"Is that all the fuck you got is a goddamn chair?"

499
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:26,280
"Where do I take this prescription, to a furniture store, motherfucker?"

500
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:29,360
"I gotta go to IKEA? What the fuck is this shit?"

501
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,520
"I said I can't walk. I didn't say I can't sit!"

502
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,320
That's right. And if you go blind, they don't got shit for you.

503
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:41,510
Look at Stevie Wonder, been blind for 40-something years...

504
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,800
got all the money in the world. Don't know if he got hundreds or ones!

505
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,520
It's just a stack to Stevie.

506
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,400
They don't got... Stevie can't see shit.

507
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,640
Can't see the day, the night, the shadow, the shade, can't even get a peek!

508
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:09,040
Just a peek. Can we help Stevie get a peek? Get a fucking peek!

509
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:12,960
The man wrote Songs in the Key of Life, Talking Book, Innervisions.

510
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:17,520
Can we get this brother a peek? Just a fucking peek!

511
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:22,800
Is that asking for too much? Just a... That's it.

512
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:32,320
You tell the doctor you're blind, he don't got shit for you.

513
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,360
"Doc, I'm blind. What you got?"

514
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:39,120
"Why don't you take this dog and have the dog drag your blind ass around town?"

515
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:44,240
"That's all the fuck you got, is a damn dog? Man, if I could see, I would whup your ass!"

516
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,240
"A fucking dog! What the fuck is wrong with you?"

517
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:50,120
"Come on, give me a midget or something!"

518
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:53,240
That's right, blind people should get midgets.

519
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,800
All blind people should get midgets.

520
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,200
It's hard enough living life when you're blind.

521
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,920
Now they gotta learn how to talk dog.

522
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:06,200
What kind of shit is that? You can't see, so you can't read the dog's lips.

523
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,840
You just listen.

524
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,200
"What, my shoelace untied? What?"

525
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,640
"Is it cold outside? What?"

526
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:20,120
"Is somebody at the door? What, motherfucker?"

527
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,360
Just give blind people midgets.

528
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:26,880
And if you're a midget, it's already hard enough to get a job.

529
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,400
Just have the midget tell the blind man where to go. Be a seeing-eye man.

530
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:36,080
Just walk in front of the blind man like, "Yo, man, you gotta make a left."

531
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,480
"Just make a left, brother."

532
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:47,680
Racism everywhere, everybody pissed off. Black people yelling, "Racism."

533
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,480
White people yelling, "Reverse racism."

534
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,360
Chinese people yelling, "Sideways racism!"

535
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,480
And the Indians ain't yelling shit 'cause they dead.

536
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,400
So everybody bitch about how bad their people got it.

537
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,320
Nobody got it worse than the American Indian.

538
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:06,000
Everybody need to calm the fuck down.

539
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,640
Indians got it bad. Indians got it the worst.

540
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:15,640
You know how bad the Indians got it? When's the last time you met two Indians?

541
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,720
You ain't never met two Indians.

542
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:23,600
Shit, I have seen a polar bear ride a fucking tricycle in my lifetime.

543
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:27,840
I have never seen an Indian family that's chilling out at Red Lobster.

544
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,120
Never seen it.

545
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:36,160
Everybody wanna save the environment. Shit, I see trees every fucking day!

546
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,960
I don't never see no Indians.

547
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,960
I went to the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade this year.

548
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,320
They didn't have enough Indians for that shit.

549
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,920
They had a bunch of Pilgrims.

550
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,120
When it came time for the Indians, they had three real Indians...

551
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:52,480
and the rest was a bunch of Puerto Ricans with feathers in their hair.

552
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,760
What the fuck! Shit, I know Puerto Ricans when I see them.

553
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:05,280
You can't slip a Puerto Rican by me.

554
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,920
That's not Pocahontas, that's Jennifer Lopez!

555
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:13,920


556
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:21,400
Racism everywhere. Who's the maddest people? White people.

557
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,480
Not y'all. Y'all all right.

558
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,480
You paid money to see me, we cool.

559
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,520
The feud is over.

560
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:34,440
No, you watch the TV, watch 60 Minutes. You see white people pissed off, man.

561
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,280
Man, the white man thinks he's losing the country.

562
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:41,000
You watch the news: "We're losing everything. We're fucking losing."

563
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:44,360
"Affirmative action, and illegal aliens..."

564
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,400
"and we're fucking losing the country."

565
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,800
Losing? Shut the fuck up. White people ain't losing shit.

566
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,800
If y'all losing, who's winning?

567
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,320
It ain't us.

568
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:06,240
It ain't us. Have you driven around this motherfucker?

569
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,920
It ain't us.

570
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,200
Shit, there ain't a white man in this room that would change places with me.

571
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:16,600
None of you would change places with me. And I'm rich!

572
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,200
That's how good it is to be white.

573
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,440
There's a white, one-legged busboy in here right now...

574
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:41,360
that won't change places with my black ass.

575
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,200
He's going, "No, man, I don't wanna switch. I wanna ride this white thing out."

576
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,240
"See where it takes me."

577
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:52,920
That's right, 'cause when you white, the sky's the limit.

578
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,520
When you black, the limit's the sky!

579
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,360
That's right, man. Now, when it comes to racism...

580
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:09,800
do you know who the most racist people are for real, the real most racist people?

581
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,560
Old black men.

582
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:16,720
You find a brother over 60... I know you white people know an old black man.

583
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,920
You go, "Willie at the job, he's so nice." Willie hates your guts.

584
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:29,840
There's nothing more racist than an old black man. You know why?

585
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,880
'Cause an old black man went through some real racism.

586
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,880
He didn't go through that I-can't-get-a-cab shit.

587
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,720
He was the cab.

588
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:42,440
A white man just jump on his back, "Main Street."

589
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,840
"Left, nigger!"

590
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,440
"Left, you fucking nigger!"

591
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,880
You know what's wild about the old black men?

592
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,760
An old black man, he ain't gonna let you fuck up his money.

593
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:04,040
Whenever an old black man sees an old white man...

594
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:07,160
the old black man always kisses the old white man's ass.

595
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:12,040
"How you doing, sir? Pleased to meet you. Whatever I can get you, you let me know."

596
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,960
As soon as the white man get out of sight, he's like:

597
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,840
"Cracker-ass cracker!"

598
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:21,280
"I'll put my foot in the crack of your ass, cracker-ass cracker!"

599
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:26,200
"I wish that cracker would've said some shit to me, saltine-assed, motherfucking cracker!"

600
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,120
"Cracker, kiss my ass, you fucking cracker!"

601
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,880
The white man come back. "Howdy, sir?"

602
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,760
I got an uncle real crazy.

603
00:42:55,840 --> 00:43:00,360
My uncle B., 55 years old, hates the white people, married to a white lady.

604
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:06,960
And he sits around going, "These crackers ain't shit, except for Susie."

605
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,880
He tried to explain the whole thing to me one day.

606
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:16,240
He said, "Yeah, I got a white wife. I love her, she love me. That's all that matters."

607
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:20,920
"But I'll tell you this: if the revolution ever come, I'll kill her first..."

608
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:26,680
"just to show these crackers I mean business!"

609
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:33,000
"Motherfucker, cracker-ass, motherfucker cracker! Shit, cracker, motherfucker!"

610
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,560
"Hey... Hi, honey."

611
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:39,880
"Motherfucker cracker. I'll kill my cracker kids, too!"

612
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:48,080
That's right, man. I don't know, black....

613
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:51,200
What do we need, y'all? I think we need a new leader.

614
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:55,240
We ain't had a black leader in a while. In a long time.

615
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,520
Somebody that moves you.

616
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:00,120
You know, we had Martin Luther King, Malcolm X...

617
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:03,240
and ever since then, a bunch of substitute teachers.

618
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:08,880
We ain't had the real thing. I want a motherfucker to move me.

619
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:12,920
Who we got? Let me break everybody down. We got Al Sharpton, all right.

620
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,200
Al Sharpton's all right. He ain't Malcolm or Martin...

621
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:20,360
but if you get your ass whupped by the cops, he's the guy to call.

622
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:25,280
Of course, Al kind of looks like Bookman from Good Times...

623
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,760
but don't let that fuck you up.

624
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,680
Who else we got? Jesse Jackson. Jesse's all right.

625
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,640
Jesse went over there, Jesse got them hostages.

626
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,960
I don't know how the hell he did that shit.

627
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:41,120
He went over there with no money, no sweet potato pie.

628
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,000


629
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,560
What the fuck did Jesse say? Jesse must've been, like:

630
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,600
"Do you want the United States to really be mad at you?"

631
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,760
"Give the hostages to me."

632
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:02,600
That's what he said, you know. What else we got? Farrakhan?

633
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:06,360
Farrakhan got everybody together for the Million Man March and everything.

634
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:09,360
But Farrakhan don't like the Jews, which is bugged.

635
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,800
I get my hair cut on Dekalb Avenue. I never been in a barbershop...

636
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,240
and heard a bunch of brothers talking about Jews.

637
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:19,160
Black people don't hate Jews. Black people hate white people!

638
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:23,360
We don't got time to dice white people up into little groups.

639
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:27,640
"I hate everybody! I don't care if you just got here."

640
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:30,680
- Hey, I'm Romanian.  - You Romanian cracker!

641
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:36,840
We need a fucking leader, man.

642
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:39,080
When we got no leaders, when something happens...

643
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:40,640
we make the shit bigger than it is.

644
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,760
It's big, but don't make it bigger than it is.

645
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:46,360
I'm watching the news, and like, "Tupac Shakur was assassinated."

646
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:51,040
"Biggie Smalls, assassinated. Struck down by assassin's bullets."

647
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,600
I'm like, "No, they wasn't!"

648
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,440
Martin Luther King was assassinated.

649
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:59,320
Malcolm X was assassinated.

650
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:02,720
John F. Kennedy was assassinated.

651
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,200
Them two niggers got shot.

652
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:20,160
Shit, I love Tupac, I love Biggie, but school will be open on their birthday.

653
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:25,480
I don't think you'll see their pictures hanging up...

654
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,720
in your grandmamma's living room.

655
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:30,200
"That's Abraham, Martin, and Pac."

656
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:39,120
"And right here, I got one of Jesus and Biggie on the seesaw."

657
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:44,320
"Jesus always in the air."

658
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:51,120
We need a leader. You know who I think the black leader should be?

659
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,360
- Who I think the black leader should be?  - Who?

660
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:55,800
Pat Riley.

661
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,120
Coach Pat Riley.

662
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:03,120
No man has led more black men to the promised land...

663
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:08,560
than Coach Pat Riley.

664
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:13,320
He may not get us to the mountaintop, but he'll get us to the playoffs.

665
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,920
And that's all we want.

666
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:19,840
We got a lot of women here tonight. Love the women.

667
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:27,800
You know who my favorite women are? Big, fat, black women.

668
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:31,600
Give me a sister about 350 pounds.

669
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:34,520
The best people in the whole world. You know why?

670
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:38,760
'Cause we live in a society where nobody likes who the fuck they are.

671
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:42,200
Everybody's on Prozac, or some shit.

672
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,240
Everybody's getting cosmetic surgery.

673
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:50,240
Nobody likes who the fuck they are except fat, black women.

674
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:54,760
Fat, black women don't give a fuck what you think.

675
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:57,080
She's going out on Friday night.

676
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:01,000
She got an outfit on. That shit match.

677
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:05,360
She got the pumps on, and the pump fat coming out the pump.

678
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:15,560
That's right. It looks like they baking bread in her shoe.

679
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:26,760
"Baby, your foot ready yet? I'll just sprinkle some cinnamon on it."

680
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:32,920
That's right. She got an anklet on, and that anklet's holding on for dear life.

681
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:40,840
Black women don't give a fuck. She's like, "I'm sexy."

682
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:44,400
"I am sexy, yes, I am!"

683
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:47,760
"I am the sexiest motherfucker here tonight!"

684
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:51,720
"Yeah, I got a gut. There's some good pussy under this gut!"

685
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,120
That's right. You want some of this so you can "livin' la vida loca!"

686
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,800
Love the women, man. Women, women.

687
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,520
What the fuck do y'all want?

688
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:23,160
Do you know what you want? Do you know where you're going to?

689
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:25,920
Do you like the things that life is showing you?

690
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,400
Do you know? What the fuck do women want?

691
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:31,880
I know what you want: everything.

692
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:37,440
That's every woman's answer: "Everything." Women want every fucking thing.

693
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:40,600
Women act like life was just a big sale, or shit.

694
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:44,360
"I want to get the most shit before things close down."

695
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:47,920
That's what fucking life is to a woman: everything.

696
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,400
You know what men want?

697
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:52,920
Food, sex, silence. That's it.

698
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:57,470
Food, sex, silence.

699
00:49:57,471 --> 00:50:01,020
"Feed me, fuckme, shut the fuck up!"

700
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:13,200
Our goals seem very attainable, don't they?

701
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,120
Women, it's hard to figure women out.

702
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:18,800
It's hard being a guy. We always think we can buy sex.

703
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:23,040
"If I take her here, she'll give me some. If I buy her this, she'll give me some."

704
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,920
Nothing get you nothing.

705
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:29,480
A woman knows if she's gonna fuck you within the first five minutes of meeting you.

706
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,640
Women know right away.

707
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:34,920
They're shaking hands like, "I'm gonna fuck him."

708
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:45,120
"I hope he don't say nothing too stupid."

709
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:50,040
That's right, fellas, don't say nothing too stupid...

710
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:52,480
because women are all about the mood.

711
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:56,320
If she's in the mood to fuck you, shut up and let it happen.

712
00:50:56,840 --> 00:51:01,360
'Cause if you say the wrong thing, them panties are coming up mighty fast.

713
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:03,560
"What'd you say?"

714
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:16,240
She be on the phone with a girlfriend, "Yeah, I was gonna give him some..."

715
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,560
"but he just started talking."

716
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:23,800
"I hate a yakking man, child."

717
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:28,320
That's right, man. Relationships: easy to get into, hard to maintain.

718
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:32,440
Why are they so hard to maintain? Because it's hard to keep up the lie.

719
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:37,400
'Cause you can't get nobody being you. You got to lie to get somebody.

720
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:42,200
You can't get nobody looking like you look, acting like you act...

721
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:44,080
sounding like you sound.

722
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:48,040
When you meet somebody for the first time, you're not meeting them.

723
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:50,640
You're meeting their representative.

724
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:58,600
That's right. Who are the biggest liars, men or women?

725
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,720
- Men!  - Women!

726
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:10,320
Men lie the most, women tell the biggest lies.

727
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:15,480
Men, we lie all the time. We lie so much, it's damn near a language.

728
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,680
It's like, to call a man out for lying...

729
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:24,680
is like playing basketball with a retarded kid and calling him for double dribble.

730
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:30,240
You gotta let some shit slide.

731
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:34,200
Men, we lie all the time.

732
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:38,280
You know what a man's lie is like? A man's lie is like, "I was at Tony's house."

733
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:40,560
"I'm at Kenny's house." That's a man's lie.

734
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:43,360
A women's lie is like, "It's your baby."

735
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,880
We've all heard that one.

736
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:58,600
- It don't even look like me.  - He's got your hat.

737
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:04,800
That's right. Who the biggest liars? Women the biggest liars.

738
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:07,200
Look at you, all of you.

739
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:10,200
You're a fucking liar. You!

740
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:15,640
You're a liar!

741
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,680
You're all liars. All of you are fucking liars!

742
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:21,040
Masters of the lie, the visual lie.

743
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:25,080
Look at you. You got on heels, you ain't that tall.

744
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:30,080
You got on makeup, your face don't look like that.

745
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:33,000
You got a weave, your hair ain't that long.

746
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:36,760
You got a Wonderbra on, your titties ain't that big.

747
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:41,920
Everything about you is a lie, and you expect me to tell the truth?

748
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,280
Fuck you!

749
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:56,520
Men lie, we live lies. That's why we so crazy.

750
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,840
Every now and then, we catch ourselves living a lie.

751
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:02,840
We create a whole lie-world around us.

752
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:07,440
For instance, every man in this room is hiding some porno in his house.

753
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:11,880
Every man in here got a pornography stash in the crib.

754
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:12,960
That's right.

755
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:16,720
Not an illegal amount, just enough to get you by.

756
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:18,200
Thank you.

757
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:21,160
And when we hide porno, we go all out.

758
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:23,520
It ain't behind the refrigerator or under the bed.

759
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:27,000
No, we become Batman when it's time to hide some porno.

760
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:31,760
That's right, you hit the light switch, the whole bookshelf shifts to the side.

761
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:36,200
You go down two flights of stairs into your porno cellar.

762
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:42,160
Janet Jacme, Kobe Tai, Jenna Jameson, that's right.

763
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:43,000


764
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,920
But women always find the porno.

765
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:50,920
But they don't find it in the porno hiding place. Oh, no.

766
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:54,560
Where do women find the porno at? In the VCR.

767
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:02,320
And fellas are like, "Damn, how can I be so dumb to leave it in the VCR?"

768
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:03,600
I'll tell you why.

769
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:07,960
'Cause when you're jerking off, you ain't in your right state of mind.

770
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:17,400
Your brain's all cloudy and foggy. I'll tell you exactly what happened.

771
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,760
One day, your woman left early.

772
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,640
You had the whole house to yourself.

773
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:26,280
So you said, "Let me get a little jerk before work."

774
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:33,400
So you in the house, getting your jerk on. Nice good jerk, too.

775
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:36,640
You know, that ain't-nobody-in-the-house jerk.

776
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:40,400
That's a good jerk. It ain't like that somebody-in-the-next-room jerk.

777
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:43,080
That's a bad jerk. That's like, "Who's that?"

778
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,320
I don't like that jerk.

779
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:51,600
I'm talking about the good jerk, that nobody-ain't-home jerk.

780
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:54,080
So you get the Vaseline ready...

781
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:56,800
and you just look at your dick and go:

782
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,760
"Scream if you want to. No one's gonna hear."

783
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:04,920
And right then, your relationship's in trouble. That's right.

784
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,160
'Cause if you can't share what you're like, you'll have problems.

785
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:11,200
When you love somebody, you got to love everything about them.

786
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,400
You got to love the crust of a motherfucker.

787
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:15,720
You can't just love the white part of the bread.

788
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:20,080
You gotta love the crust, the crumbs, the tiny crumbs at the bottom of the toaster.

789
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:21,960
That's what the real motherfucker is.

790
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:26,120
Whatever you into, your woman gotta be into, too, and vice versa...

791
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:28,040
or the shit ain't gonna work.

792
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:31,280
It ain't gonna work.

793
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:36,080
That's right. If you born-again, your woman gotta be born-again, too.

794
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:39,440
If you a crackhead, your woman gotta be a crackhead, too...

795
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:41,440
or the shit won't work.

796
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:46,280
You can't be like, "I'm going to church, where you going?" "Hit the pipe!"

797
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:50,480
That relationship ain't going nowhere.

798
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:53,400
Two crackheads can stay together forever.

799
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:57,920
That's right, what's gonna happen? They're gonna stop fucking, that's right.

800
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,520
They'll stop talking, stop fucking.

801
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:04,480
You ever been in bed with your woman, both talking dirty, and you go too far?

802
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:08,360
You ever say some shit that gets you kicked out of bed?

803
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:12,800
And the woman's like, "Fuck me, harder! Fuck me, Daddy, spank me!"

804
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:15,520
- All right, you ho.  - Who you calling a ho?

805
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,880
"Who the fuck are you calling a ho?"

806
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:21,640
"Untie me!"

807
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:32,640
I ain't no expert or no shit, but, fellas, if you're gonna talk dirty to your woman...

808
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,960
you got to talk with authority.

809
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,880
You can get a woman to do any nasty little thing you want.

810
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:40,640
You say that shit like a man, make a little eye contact...

811
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:43,360
put a little bass in your voice, she will do that shit.

812
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:47,120
She wants to do that shit. She's dying to do that shit.

813
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:51,080
Your woman is nastier than you ever imagined.

814
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,840
But you gotta come correct...

815
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:58,920
because anything you mumble ain't getting done.

816
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:03,040
You can't be in bed all unsure, like, "Excuse me..."

817
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:08,240
"Excuse me, I was wondering..."

818
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:12,160
"Ma'am, I have a request. Could you lick my balls?"

819
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:17,600
"I ain't licking nothing. Lick your own balls!"

820
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:21,120
See, if you just said it right, you'd been in there.

821
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,040
Now you got dry balls.

822
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:26,800
That's right, confidence always wins.

823
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:31,120
Do you realize, it is 1999, some women still don't give head?

824
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,760
Ninety-fucking-nine.

825
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:35,160
Whenever I meet a girl that doesn't give head...

826
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:39,980
I look at them like a damn Betamax, "They still make you?"

827
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:46,520
And when it comes to head, there's three types of women:

828
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:50,040
A: Women that don't give head. Bye, leave, see you.

829
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:54,760
B: Women that give you just enough head to shut you up.

830
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:58,920
You ever meet them women? They're like, "You okay?"

831
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:14,000
I hate them women!

832
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:16,480
And number three, my favorite woman:

833
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:19,760
the woman that likes nothing better than to suck a dick.

834
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:22,840
That's right, God bless all of you!

835
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:26,720
That's right, you make the world a better place to live in.

836
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:30,520
I want you to suck my dick like you think the antidote's in it!

837
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:34,080
Like you trying to get some Robitussin out of that motherfucker!

838
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:43,240
That's right. Relationships: easy to get into, hard to maintain.

839
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:47,760
Why are they so hard to maintain? 'Cause at some point you just stop talking.

840
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:50,760
That's right, everybody stops talking after a while.

841
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:54,320
You know how it is. You come home and you start nodding.

842
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,600
"Yeah, we cool."

843
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:59,160
"I'm gonna get a little something to eat."

844
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:00,720
Why do you stop talking?

845
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:05,280
'Cause at some point, you have heard everything this person has to say...

846
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:08,320
and it makes you sick to your stomach.

847
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:13,480
You know what they're gonna say before it even comes out their mouth...

848
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:16,720
and you just wanna stab them in the neck with a pencil!

849
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:19,440
Your can't take the shit no more!

850
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:20,460
And they're like,

851
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:23,760
- Remember that time?  - Yeah, I remember that time!

852
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:27,320
- I ever tell you about...  - Yeah, you told me about that time!

853
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:32,280
"Stop telling me the same shit over and over again!"

854
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:36,960
"Why don't you go out and get kidnapped, have some new shit happen to you?"

855
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:42,720
That's right. Fellas, you gotta talk.

856
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:47,040
That's women's biggest complaint: "You don't talk."

857
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:51,280
"You need to talk, let's talk. You don't talk."

858
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:53,600
That's right. Women love to talk.

859
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:57,640
If they had talking in the Olympics, a man wouldn't stand a chance.

860
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:00,480
Women love to talk, but they don't wanna talk to you.

861
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:02,080
They wanna talk to their man.

862
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:04,840
But women don't want you to talk-talk.

863
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:08,400
Women just want you to listen-listen.

864
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:13,880
All a woman really wants you to do is ask her the correct questions...

865
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:16,960
that will allow her to run her fucking mouth!

866
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:23,080
You set her up, she'll knock them down.

867
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:25,640
Fellas, you want your woman to be happy?

868
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:29,280
All you got to say is, "How was your day?

869
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:31,200
"Honey, how was your day?"

870
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:36,040
Know why? 'Cause "How was your day?" is a 45-minute conversation to a woman.

871
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:40,480
And as a man, you don't really gotta talk. You gotta just act like you're talking.

872
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:43,960
"Get out of here. Go on! I don't believe it."

873
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:46,640
"You don't say! Really? Get out of here!"

874
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:50,280
"Go on. I don't believe it. You don't say? Get out of here."

875
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:52,560
"I told you that bitch crazy!"

876
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:58,280
You gotta throw in, "I told you that bitch crazy." You know why?

877
01:01:58,360 --> 01:02:03,080
'Cause every woman's got another woman at her job that she can't stand.

878
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:09,520
Women, y'all exaggerate everything. You turn it into some Dynasty shit, like:

879
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,800
"She's trying to destroy me!"

880
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:16,720
What the fuck are you talking about? You wrap up bags at J.C. Penney's!

881
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:19,880
What's she doing, ripping up your paper?

882
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:23,800
Fellas, you gotta talk. Women, exact opposite.

883
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:26,880
Y'all gotta learn when not to talk. That's right.

884
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:29,960
You ever notice how no man comes home straight from work?

885
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:31,960
No man comes home straight from work.

886
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,520
A man get off work, he got to go somewhere.

887
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:37,800
He got to drink something, he got to smoke something...

888
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:41,160
he got to watch the game, he got to hang with his boys...

889
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:42,720
he got to take a drive.

890
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:46,480
He got to do something that will mentally prepare him...

891
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:50,960
for all the talking he gonna hear when he get home.

892
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:57,000
Ladies, it ain't that you talk too much.

893
01:02:57,080 --> 01:03:00,680
You just talk too much as soon as we get in the fucking door.

894
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:04,880
Let a man get situated. We don't need to hear everything right away.

895
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:08,400
Soon as you take one step in, "You're not gonna believe this..."

896
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:14,120
Let me get my other foot in the fucking door!

897
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:17,280
Let me get something to eat! Let me get something to drink!

898
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:18,920
Let me take a shit!

899
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:22,880
Go in the fucking kitchen and get me my big piece of chicken!

900
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:25,720
I'm out of here. Thank you, New York!

901
