1
00:00:18,587 --> 00:00:22,049
Out west there was this fella,

2
00:00:22,132 --> 00:00:24,259
fella I want to tell you about,

3
00:00:24,343 --> 00:00:27,554
fella by the name
of Jeff Lebowski...

4
00:00:27,638 --> 00:00:31,058
at least that's the handle
his parents gave him.

5
00:00:31,141 --> 00:00:34,603
But he never had
much use for it himself.

6
00:00:34,686 --> 00:00:38,565
This Lebowski,
he called himself the Dude.

7
00:00:38,649 --> 00:00:43,070
Now, Dude, that's a name
no one would self... apply

8
00:00:43,153 --> 00:00:45,072
where I come from.

9
00:00:45,155 --> 00:00:49,952
There was a lot about the Dude
that didn't make sense to me,

10
00:00:50,035 --> 00:00:53,288
and a lot about
where he lived, likewise.

11
00:00:54,957 --> 00:00:56,875
But then again,

12
00:00:56,959 --> 00:01:00,963
maybe that's why I found
the place so darn interesting.

13
00:01:04,299 --> 00:01:08,804
They call Los Angeles
the City of Angels.

14
00:01:08,887 --> 00:01:12,057
I didn't find it
to be that exactly.

15
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:15,394
But there are
some nice folks there.

16
00:01:15,477 --> 00:01:18,855
'Course I can't
say I seen London,

17
00:01:18,939 --> 00:01:21,358
and I never been to France,

18
00:01:21,441 --> 00:01:25,362
and I ain't never seen
no queen in her damned undies.

19
00:01:25,445 --> 00:01:28,448
But I'll tell you what,

20
00:01:28,532 --> 00:01:30,701
after seeing Los Angeles

21
00:01:30,784 --> 00:01:33,662
and this story
I'm about to unfold,

22
00:01:33,745 --> 00:01:38,250
well, I guess I seen somethin'
every bit as stupefyin'

23
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:41,128
as you'd see
in any other places,

24
00:01:41,211 --> 00:01:43,422
and in English, too.

25
00:01:43,505 --> 00:01:46,341
So I can die
with a smile on my face

26
00:01:46,425 --> 00:01:49,636
without feeling like
the good Lord gypped me.

27
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,389
Now, this story
I'm about to unfold

28
00:01:52,472 --> 00:01:54,641
took place
back in the early 90s,

29
00:01:54,725 --> 00:01:59,646
about the time of our conflict
with Saddam and the Iraqis.

30
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:03,150
I only mention it 'cause
sometimes there's a man...

31
00:02:03,233 --> 00:02:07,362
I won't say a hero,
'cause what's a hero?

32
00:02:07,446 --> 00:02:10,365
But sometimes there's a man...

33
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:13,452
and I'm talking
about the Dude here...

34
00:02:13,535 --> 00:02:16,079
sometimes there's a man...

35
00:02:16,163 --> 00:02:20,918
Well, he's the man
for his time and place.

36
00:02:21,001 --> 00:02:23,170
He fits right in there,

37
00:02:23,253 --> 00:02:25,881
and that's the Dude,

38
00:02:25,964 --> 00:02:27,925
in Los Angeles.

39
00:02:28,008 --> 00:02:30,844
And even if he's a lazy man,

40
00:02:30,928 --> 00:02:33,889
and the Dude was
most certainly that,

41
00:02:33,972 --> 00:02:37,559
quite possibly the laziest
in Los Angeles county,

42
00:02:37,643 --> 00:02:39,561
which would place him high

43
00:02:39,645 --> 00:02:42,773
in the running
for laziest worldwide.

44
00:02:42,856 --> 00:02:45,192
But sometimes there's a man,

45
00:02:45,275 --> 00:02:47,236
sometimes...

46
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:49,404
there's a man...

47
00:02:49,488 --> 00:02:53,450
Wow, lost my train
of thought here.

48
00:02:53,533 --> 00:02:56,662
But... ah, hell.

49
00:02:56,745 --> 00:02:58,580
I done introduced him enough.

50
00:02:58,664 --> 00:03:01,833
'This will not stand.

51
00:03:01,917 --> 00:03:05,754
'This will not stand,
this aggression against Kuwait.'

52
00:03:35,742 --> 00:03:37,744
Where's the money, Lebowski?

53
00:03:39,454 --> 00:03:43,166
I want that money, Lebowski.
Bunny says you're good for it.

54
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,877
Where's the money, Lebowski?

55
00:03:45,961 --> 00:03:48,171
Where's the money, Lebowski?

56
00:03:48,255 --> 00:03:50,549
Where's the fucking
money, shithead?

57
00:03:52,301 --> 00:03:56,138
It's down there somewhere.
Let me take another look.

58
00:03:56,221 --> 00:03:59,141
Don't fuck with us!

59
00:04:00,642 --> 00:04:03,604
Your wife owes money
to Jackie Treehorn.

60
00:04:03,687 --> 00:04:06,732
That means you owe
money to Jackie Treehorn.

61
00:04:06,815 --> 00:04:09,651
Ever thus
to deadbeats, Lebowski.

62
00:04:09,735 --> 00:04:11,194
Don't do that...

63
00:04:13,572 --> 00:04:15,657
- Not on the rug, man.
- See?

64
00:04:15,741 --> 00:04:18,869
See what happens, Lebowski?
You see what happens?

65
00:04:18,952 --> 00:04:21,997
Nobody calls me Lebowski.
You got the wrong man.

66
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,790
I'm the Dude, man.

67
00:04:23,874 --> 00:04:28,045
Your name's Lebowski, Lebowski.
Your wife is Bunny.

68
00:04:29,087 --> 00:04:31,757
My... my wife... my wife, Bunny?

69
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,009
Do you see a wedding ring?

70
00:04:34,092 --> 00:04:36,386
Does this place
look like I'm married?

71
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:38,847
The toilet seat's up, man.

72
00:04:46,229 --> 00:04:48,232
What the fuck is this?

73
00:04:48,315 --> 00:04:51,485
Obviously, you're not a golfer.

74
00:04:53,403 --> 00:04:55,614
- Woo?
- Yeah?

75
00:04:55,697 --> 00:04:59,159
Isn't this guy supposed
to be a millionaire?

76
00:04:59,243 --> 00:05:00,994
Fuck!

77
00:05:01,912 --> 00:05:05,916
- Yeah, what do you think?
- He looks like a fucking loser.

78
00:05:05,999 --> 00:05:08,877
Hey, at least I'm housebroken.

79
00:05:08,961 --> 00:05:12,881
Fucking time wasted.
Thanks a lot, asshole.

80
00:07:22,469 --> 00:07:25,973
I'm throwing rocks tonight.
Mark it, Dude.

81
00:07:26,056 --> 00:07:29,476
This was a valued rug.
This was a...

82
00:07:29,559 --> 00:07:32,479
It really
tied the room together.

83
00:07:32,562 --> 00:07:34,690
So this was a valued...

84
00:07:34,773 --> 00:07:36,483
- What tied the room together?
- My rug.

85
00:07:36,567 --> 00:07:38,485
- Were you listening, Donny?
- What?

86
00:07:38,569 --> 00:07:41,029
Were you listening
to the Dude's story?

87
00:07:41,113 --> 00:07:42,489
I was bowling.

88
00:07:42,573 --> 00:07:46,618
You have no frame of reference,
like a child who wanders in...

89
00:07:46,702 --> 00:07:48,537
Walter, what's the point?

90
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,706
There's no reason...
here's my point, Dude...

91
00:07:50,789 --> 00:07:53,166
- there's no reason...
- Yeah, what's your point?

92
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,544
- Huh?
- Walter, what is the point...

93
00:07:55,627 --> 00:07:58,046
We know who is at fault here.

94
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:00,090
What the fuck
are you talking about?

95
00:08:00,173 --> 00:08:02,926
No, what the fuck are you...
I'm not...

96
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:06,054
We're talking about
unchecked aggression here.

97
00:08:06,138 --> 00:08:07,889
- What is he talking about?
- My rug.

98
00:08:07,973 --> 00:08:10,434
Forget it,
you're out of your element.

99
00:08:10,517 --> 00:08:14,354
The Chinaman who peed on my rug,
I can't go give him a bill.

100
00:08:14,438 --> 00:08:17,149
So what the fuck
are you talking about?

101
00:08:17,232 --> 00:08:19,359
The Chinaman
is not the issue here.

102
00:08:19,443 --> 00:08:22,487
I'm talking about
drawing a line in the sand.

103
00:08:22,571 --> 00:08:24,865
Across this line, you do not...

104
00:08:24,948 --> 00:08:28,535
Also, Dude, "Chinaman" is not
the preferred nomenclature.

105
00:08:28,619 --> 00:08:30,579
"Asian... American," please.

106
00:08:30,662 --> 00:08:34,249
This isn't a guy who built
the railroads here...

107
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,835
- What the fuck...
- He peed on my rug.

108
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:40,714
- He peed on the Dude's rug.
- You're out of your element!

109
00:08:40,797 --> 00:08:43,675
Dude, the Chinaman
is not the issue here.

110
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:46,053
- So, who... who...
- Jeff Lebowski.

111
00:08:46,136 --> 00:08:49,848
The other Jeffrey Lebowski,
the millionaire.

112
00:08:49,932 --> 00:08:52,768
That's fucking interesting, man.
That's fucking interesting.

113
00:08:52,851 --> 00:08:55,979
Plus, he has the wealth
and the resources...

114
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:58,649
so there's no reason,
no fucking reason

115
00:08:58,732 --> 00:09:01,360
why his wife
should go out, owe money,

116
00:09:01,443 --> 00:09:04,029
and then they pee
on your fucking rug!

117
00:09:04,112 --> 00:09:05,864
- Am I wrong?
- No.

118
00:09:05,948 --> 00:09:07,616
- Am I wrong?
- But...

119
00:09:07,699 --> 00:09:09,534
OK, then.

120
00:09:09,618 --> 00:09:13,288
That rug really tied
the room together, did it not?

121
00:09:13,372 --> 00:09:15,582
- Fuckin' A!
- And he peed on it.

122
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:17,251
Donny, please.

123
00:09:17,334 --> 00:09:20,212
I could find this
fucking Lebowski guy.

124
00:09:20,295 --> 00:09:23,465
His name is Lebowski?
That's your name, Dude.

125
00:09:23,548 --> 00:09:27,052
He should compensate me
for the fucking rug.

126
00:09:27,135 --> 00:09:30,847
His wife owes money,
and they pee on my rug?

127
00:09:30,931 --> 00:09:34,643
- They pee on your fucking rug.
- They peed on my fucking rug.

128
00:09:34,726 --> 00:09:36,520
That's right, Dude.

129
00:09:36,603 --> 00:09:39,815
They peed on your fucking rug.

130
00:09:41,525 --> 00:09:44,695
This is the study.
The various commendations...

131
00:09:44,778 --> 00:09:46,863
Jeffrey Lebowski.

132
00:09:46,947 --> 00:09:50,158
- Honorary degrees, etcetera.
- Very impressive.

133
00:09:50,242 --> 00:09:52,744
Oh, please feel free
to inspect them.

134
00:09:52,828 --> 00:09:56,248
- Oh, I'm not really that...
- Oh, please, please.

135
00:09:56,331 --> 00:09:58,750
That is the key
to the city of Pasadena,

136
00:09:58,834 --> 00:10:03,297
which Mr Lebowski received in
recognition of various civic...

137
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,215
Oh, that's the Los Angeles

138
00:10:05,299 --> 00:10:08,093
Chamber of Commerce
Business Achiever Award,

139
00:10:08,176 --> 00:10:10,762
which is... not
necessarily given every year.

140
00:10:10,846 --> 00:10:14,308
Hey, is this, uh,
is this him with Nancy?

141
00:10:14,391 --> 00:10:18,520
Yes, indeed, that is Mr Lebowski
with the First Lady...

142
00:10:18,604 --> 00:10:21,189
That's Lebowski
on the left there?

143
00:10:21,273 --> 00:10:23,901
Of course.
Mr Lebowski on the left...

144
00:10:23,984 --> 00:10:27,070
He's a cripple... you know,
a... handicapped guy?

145
00:10:27,154 --> 00:10:30,616
Mr Lebowski is disabled, yes.
This picture was taken

146
00:10:30,699 --> 00:10:33,702
when Mrs Reagan was
First Lady of the nation.

147
00:10:33,785 --> 00:10:36,747
- Yes, yes. Not of California.
- Pope John.

148
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:39,333
He met privately
with the president,

149
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:42,044
but there was no time
for a photo opportunity.

150
00:10:42,127 --> 00:10:44,338
- Nancy's pretty good.
- Wonderful woman!

151
00:10:44,421 --> 00:10:46,256
These are...

152
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:49,551
Those are Mr Lebowski's
children, so to speak.

153
00:10:49,635 --> 00:10:51,762
Different mothers?
Racially, pretty cool.

154
00:10:53,597 --> 00:10:56,224
They're not literally
his children.

155
00:10:56,308 --> 00:10:58,644
They're the Little
Lebowski Urban Achievers,

156
00:10:58,727 --> 00:11:01,104
inner... city children of promise

157
00:11:01,188 --> 00:11:03,982
but without the means
for a higher education.

158
00:11:04,066 --> 00:11:06,902
Mr Lebowski is committed
to sending them to college.

159
00:11:06,985 --> 00:11:09,571
Excuse me. Thank you, thank you.

160
00:11:09,655 --> 00:11:12,616
Far out. Think he's
got room for one more?

161
00:11:12,699 --> 00:11:14,993
One, uh... Oh!

162
00:11:16,036 --> 00:11:19,498
You never went to college.
Please, don't touch that.

163
00:11:19,581 --> 00:11:22,501
Yeah, I did, but I spent
most of my time...

164
00:11:22,584 --> 00:11:25,629
occupying various
administration buildings,

165
00:11:25,712 --> 00:11:27,714
smoking a lot of Thai stick,

166
00:11:27,798 --> 00:11:30,425
breaking into the R.O.T.C.
And bowling.

167
00:11:30,509 --> 00:11:32,970
To tell you the truth,
I don't remember much.

168
00:11:38,558 --> 00:11:41,853
OK, sir, you're a Lebowski,
I'm a Lebowski,

169
00:11:41,937 --> 00:11:43,855
that's terrific.

170
00:11:43,939 --> 00:11:46,984
But I'm very busy,
as I imagine you are.

171
00:11:47,067 --> 00:11:49,444
What can I do for you, sir?

172
00:11:49,528 --> 00:11:53,073
Well, sir, it's this rug I have,

173
00:11:53,156 --> 00:11:56,034
it really tied
the room together...

174
00:11:56,118 --> 00:11:59,955
You told Brandt, he told me.
Where do I fit in?

175
00:12:00,038 --> 00:12:03,292
Well, they were
looking for you, these guys.

176
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:05,419
I'll say it again.

177
00:12:05,502 --> 00:12:08,672
You told Brandt
on the phone, he told me.

178
00:12:08,755 --> 00:12:10,591
I know what happened. Yes?

179
00:12:10,674 --> 00:12:14,219
So you know that they were
trying to piss on your rug?

180
00:12:14,303 --> 00:12:16,722
Did I urinate on your rug?

181
00:12:16,805 --> 00:12:19,391
Did you personally
come and pee on my rug?

182
00:12:19,474 --> 00:12:22,728
Hello! Do you speak English?
Parla usted ingles?

183
00:12:22,811 --> 00:12:25,856
I'll ask you again.
Did I urinate on your rug?

184
00:12:25,939 --> 00:12:29,026
No, like I said,
Woo peed on my rug.

185
00:12:29,109 --> 00:12:31,278
I want to understand this, sir.

186
00:12:31,361 --> 00:12:35,073
Every time a rug is
micturated upon in this city,

187
00:12:35,157 --> 00:12:36,783
I have to compensate...

188
00:12:36,867 --> 00:12:40,704
Come on, man, I'm not
trying to scam anybody here.

189
00:12:40,787 --> 00:12:42,581
I... I was just...

190
00:12:42,664 --> 00:12:46,126
You're just looking for
a handout like every other...

191
00:12:46,209 --> 00:12:49,004
Are you employed, Mr Lebowski?

192
00:12:49,087 --> 00:12:52,716
Wait, let me
explain something to you.

193
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:56,261
I am not Mr Lebowski.
You're Mr Lebowski.

194
00:12:56,345 --> 00:12:59,306
I'm the Dude.
So that's what you call me,

195
00:12:59,389 --> 00:13:02,809
you know, uh, that
or, uh, his Dudeness,

196
00:13:02,893 --> 00:13:05,854
or Duder, or, you
know, uh, el Duderino,

197
00:13:05,938 --> 00:13:09,066
if you're not into
the whole brevity thing.

198
00:13:09,149 --> 00:13:12,653
- Are you employed, sir?
- Employed?

199
00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:18,033
You don't look for a job
dressed like that on a weekday?

200
00:13:18,116 --> 00:13:21,161
Is this a... What day is this?

201
00:13:21,245 --> 00:13:24,790
Well, I do work, sir.
So if you don't mind...

202
00:13:24,873 --> 00:13:27,209
No, I do mind. The Dude minds.

203
00:13:27,292 --> 00:13:29,336
This will not stand, you know.

204
00:13:29,419 --> 00:13:32,547
This aggression
will not stand, man.

205
00:13:32,631 --> 00:13:36,593
- I mean, your wife owes...
- My wife is not the issue!

206
00:13:36,677 --> 00:13:40,764
I hope that my wife will learn
to live on her ample allowance.

207
00:13:40,847 --> 00:13:44,142
If not, that's
her problem, not mine,

208
00:13:44,226 --> 00:13:46,228
just as the rug is your problem,

209
00:13:46,311 --> 00:13:50,816
just as every bum's lot in life
is his own responsibility,

210
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:53,277
regardless of who
he chooses to blame.

211
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,488
I didn't blame anyone
for the loss of my legs.

212
00:13:56,572 --> 00:13:59,408
Some Chinaman
took them from me in Korea.

213
00:13:59,491 --> 00:14:02,619
But I went out
and achieved anyway.

214
00:14:02,703 --> 00:14:06,582
I cannot solve your problems,
sir, only you can.

215
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,711
- Oh, fuck it.
- "Oh, fuck it."

216
00:14:10,794 --> 00:14:13,505
Yes, that's your answer
to everything.

217
00:14:13,589 --> 00:14:15,048
Tattoo it on your forehead.

218
00:14:15,132 --> 00:14:18,427
Your revolution
is over, Mr Lebowski!

219
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:21,138
Condolences! The bums lost!

220
00:14:21,221 --> 00:14:24,891
My advice to you
is to do what your parents did!

221
00:14:24,975 --> 00:14:26,768
Get a job, sir!

222
00:14:26,852 --> 00:14:31,023
The bums will always lose!
Do you hear me, Lebowski?

223
00:14:31,106 --> 00:14:32,608
The bums...

224
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:36,987
How was your meeting,
Mr Lebowski?

225
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:41,575
OK. The old man told me
to take any rug in the house.

226
00:14:41,658 --> 00:14:45,829
Well, enjoy, and perhaps
we'll see you again, Dude.

227
00:14:45,913 --> 00:14:49,833
Sure, if I'm in
the neighbourhood, you know,

228
00:14:49,917 --> 00:14:51,793
and, um...

229
00:14:51,877 --> 00:14:54,212
I need to use the john.

230
00:15:04,431 --> 00:15:07,184
Blow on them.

231
00:15:07,267 --> 00:15:09,645
Go ahead, blow.

232
00:15:09,728 --> 00:15:14,524
You want me to blow
on your toes?

233
00:15:14,608 --> 00:15:17,861
Uh... huh. I can't blow that far.

234
00:15:24,409 --> 00:15:26,370
Are you sure he won't mind?

235
00:15:26,453 --> 00:15:30,249
He doesn't care about anything.
He's a nihilist.

236
00:15:30,332 --> 00:15:32,918
Oh, that must be exhausting.

237
00:15:33,001 --> 00:15:34,795
You're not blowing.

238
00:15:34,878 --> 00:15:37,839
He has to be getting along,
Mrs Lebowski.

239
00:15:37,923 --> 00:15:40,092
Oh, you're Bunny.

240
00:15:41,593 --> 00:15:43,845
I'll suck your cock for $1,000.

241
00:15:48,058 --> 00:15:49,726
Wonderful woman.

242
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:52,479
We're very fond of her.
Very free... spirited.

243
00:15:52,563 --> 00:15:55,232
Brandt can't watch,
or he has to pay 100.

244
00:15:56,149 --> 00:15:57,818
That's marvellous.

245
00:15:59,945 --> 00:16:03,740
I'm just gonna
go find a cash machine.

246
00:16:07,411 --> 00:16:10,122
Whoo! Slamming them tonight!

247
00:16:10,205 --> 00:16:12,374
You guys are dead in the water.

248
00:16:12,457 --> 00:16:15,252
All right! Way to go, Donny!

249
00:16:15,335 --> 00:16:19,047
If you will it, it is no dream.

250
00:16:19,131 --> 00:16:22,259
You're 20 minutes late, man.
What the fuck is that?

251
00:16:22,342 --> 00:16:24,261
Theodore Herzel.

252
00:16:24,344 --> 00:16:28,432
The state of Israel. If you
will it, Dude, it is no dream.

253
00:16:28,515 --> 00:16:32,269
The carrier. What's
in the fucking carrier?

254
00:16:32,352 --> 00:16:35,939
Oh, Cynthia's dog.
I think it's a Pomeranian.

255
00:16:36,023 --> 00:16:38,191
I can't leave him,
he eats the furniture.

256
00:16:38,275 --> 00:16:40,819
I'm watching it
while they're in Hawaii.

257
00:16:40,903 --> 00:16:44,323
- You brought it bowling?
- "Brought it bowling"?

258
00:16:44,406 --> 00:16:47,576
I didn't rent it shoes,
I'm not buying it a beer,

259
00:16:47,659 --> 00:16:49,786
he's not taking your turn, Dude.

260
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:53,248
If my ex... wife asked me
to take care of her dog

261
00:16:53,332 --> 00:16:56,043
while she and her boyfriend
went to Honolulu,

262
00:16:56,126 --> 00:16:57,878
I'd tell her to fuck herself.

263
00:16:57,961 --> 00:17:00,005
Dude, you don't have an ex,

264
00:17:00,088 --> 00:17:03,133
and this is a fucking show dog
with fucking papers.

265
00:17:03,216 --> 00:17:07,804
You can't board it. It gets
upset. Its hair falls out.

266
00:17:07,888 --> 00:17:09,932
Over the line!

267
00:17:10,015 --> 00:17:13,477
Sorry, you were over the line.
That's a foul.

268
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,562
Bullshit. Mark it 8, Dude.

269
00:17:15,646 --> 00:17:18,523
Excuse me, mark it zero.
Next frame.

270
00:17:18,607 --> 00:17:20,859
Bullshit, Walter.
Mark it 8, Dude.

271
00:17:20,943 --> 00:17:24,238
This is not 'Nam, this
is bowling. There are rules.

272
00:17:24,321 --> 00:17:26,657
Hey, Walter, come on,
it's Smokey.

273
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:29,910
His toe slipped over.
It's just a game.

274
00:17:29,993 --> 00:17:33,580
It determines who enters
the round... robin. Am I wrong?

275
00:17:33,664 --> 00:17:35,457
- Yeah, but...
- Am I wrong?

276
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,501
Yeah, but I wasn't over.

277
00:17:37,584 --> 00:17:40,295
Give me the marker, Dude.
I'm marking an 8.

278
00:17:40,379 --> 00:17:44,007
Smokey, my friend,
you're entering a world of pain.

279
00:17:44,091 --> 00:17:46,593
- Walter...
- You mark that frame an 8,

280
00:17:46,677 --> 00:17:49,596
you're entering a world of pain.

281
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,474
- I'm not...
- A world of pain.

282
00:17:52,557 --> 00:17:54,977
Look, Dude,
this is your partner.

283
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,853
Has the world gone crazy?

284
00:17:56,937 --> 00:17:59,731
Am I the only one
who cares about the rules?

285
00:17:59,815 --> 00:18:01,191
Mark it zero!

286
00:18:01,275 --> 00:18:04,403
- They're calling the cops.
- Mark it zero!

287
00:18:04,486 --> 00:18:07,197
- Put the piece away.
- Walter...

288
00:18:07,281 --> 00:18:09,908
You think I'm fucking around?
Mark it zero!

289
00:18:16,873 --> 00:18:18,917
All right, it's fucking zero.

290
00:18:19,001 --> 00:18:22,337
You happy, you crazy fuck?

291
00:18:23,714 --> 00:18:26,091
It's a league game, Smoke.

292
00:18:29,136 --> 00:18:30,220
You can't do that, man.

293
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,764
These guys are like me.
They're pacifists.

294
00:18:32,848 --> 00:18:34,891
Smokey was
a conscientious objector.

295
00:18:34,975 --> 00:18:37,728
I myself dabbled in pacifism,

296
00:18:37,811 --> 00:18:39,897
not in 'Nam, of course.

297
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:42,566
You know he's got
emotional problems.

298
00:18:42,649 --> 00:18:44,985
You mean, beyond pacifism?

299
00:18:45,068 --> 00:18:48,572
He's fragile, very fragile.

300
00:18:48,655 --> 00:18:52,409
I did not know that.

301
00:18:52,492 --> 00:18:55,662
Well, it's all
water under the bridge,

302
00:18:55,746 --> 00:18:58,373
and we do enter
the next round... robin.

303
00:18:58,457 --> 00:19:00,959
- Am I wrong?
- No, you're not wrong.

304
00:19:01,043 --> 00:19:04,296
- Am I wrong?
- No, you're just an asshole!

305
00:19:04,379 --> 00:19:08,008
OK. We play Quintana
and O'Brien next week.

306
00:19:08,091 --> 00:19:10,802
They should be pushovers.

307
00:19:10,886 --> 00:19:13,388
Man, will you just...

308
00:19:13,472 --> 00:19:15,724
Just take it easy, man.

309
00:19:15,807 --> 00:19:18,143
That's your answer
for everything, Dude.

310
00:19:18,227 --> 00:19:23,315
Look at our current situation
with that camelfucker in Iraq.

311
00:19:23,398 --> 00:19:25,734
Pacifism is not
something to hide behind.

312
00:19:25,817 --> 00:19:28,028
Just take it easy, man.

313
00:19:28,111 --> 00:19:30,072
I'm perfectly calm, Dude.

314
00:19:30,155 --> 00:19:33,659
- Waving the fucking gun around?
- Calmer than you are.

315
00:19:33,742 --> 00:19:35,452
Just take it easy!

316
00:19:36,453 --> 00:19:38,497
Calmer than you are.

317
00:19:42,501 --> 00:19:44,628
'Dude, this is Smokey.

318
00:19:44,711 --> 00:19:46,797
'I don't want to
be a hard... on about this.

319

320

will submit this to the league

321

322
00:19:55,138 --> 00:19:57,182

00:19:57,266 --> 00:20:00,102
'So, like I say,
you know, fair warning.

324
00:20:00,185 --> 00:20:02,229
'Tell Walter. I'm sorry.'

325
00:20:05,023 --> 00:20:08,026
'Mr Lebowski,
this is Brandt at, uh,

the Southern Cal Bowling League.

- Hey, Monty.

Dude, I... I finally got...
the venue I wanted.

335
00:20:39,683 --> 00:20:43,270
I'm performing my dance quintet,
you know, my cycle,

at Crane Jackson's Fountain
Street Theatre on Tuesday night.

337
00:20:46,648 --> 00:20:50,944
And, well, I'd love it
if you came and gave me notes.

338
00:20:51,028 --> 00:20:52,946
I'll be there, man.

339
00:20:56,742 --> 00:20:58,827
Tomorrow's already the 10th.

340
00:20:58,911 --> 00:21:00,787
Far out.

341
00:21:03,749 --> 00:21:06,043
Oh. Oh, all right, OK.

342
00:21:06,126 --> 00:21:08,754
Just slip the rent
under my door.

352

We've had terrible news.
Mr Lebowski's in seclusion.

353
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:49,169
Mr Lebowski.

354
00:21:54,508 --> 00:21:57,052
Funny...

355
00:21:57,636 --> 00:22:01,223
I can look back
on a life of achievement,

356
00:22:01,306 --> 00:22:03,559
challenges met,

357
00:22:03,642 --> 00:22:05,602
competitors bested,

358
00:22:05,686 --> 00:22:08,438
obstacles overcome.

359
00:22:09,273 --> 00:22:13,110
I've accomplished more
than most men

360
00:22:13,193 --> 00:22:15,779
and without the use of my legs.

361
00:22:16,822 --> 00:22:18,448
What...

362
00:22:18,532 --> 00:22:22,119
What makes a man, Mr Lebowski?

363
00:22:23,328 --> 00:22:25,539
Dude.

364
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:30,085
I... I don't know, sir.

365
00:22:30,168 --> 00:22:33,338
Is it being prepared
to do the right thing?

366
00:22:34,965 --> 00:22:37,301
Whatever the cost?

367
00:22:37,384 --> 00:22:40,220
Isn't that what makes a man?

368
00:22:40,304 --> 00:22:42,389
Sure, that
and a pair of testicles.

369
00:22:43,807 --> 00:22:45,851
You're joking. But...

370
00:22:47,603 --> 00:22:49,730
Perhaps you're right.

371
00:22:49,813 --> 00:22:52,316
You mind if I do a "J"?

372
00:22:53,483 --> 00:22:54,818
Bunny...

373
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,405
Excuse me?

374
00:22:58,488 --> 00:23:01,033
Bunny Lebowski,

375
00:23:01,116 --> 00:23:04,036
she is the light of my life.

376
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:07,247
Are you surprised
at my tears, sir?

377
00:23:08,957 --> 00:23:11,168
Fuckin' A.

378
00:23:11,251 --> 00:23:14,504
Strong men also cry.

379
00:23:15,005 --> 00:23:18,759
Strong men also cry.

380
00:23:21,011 --> 00:23:24,222
I received this fax
this morning.

381
00:23:26,683 --> 00:23:28,894
As you can see,

382
00:23:28,977 --> 00:23:31,021
it is a ransom note.

383
00:23:31,104 --> 00:23:33,982
"We have Bunnie."

384
00:23:34,066 --> 00:23:38,570
Sent by men who can't achieve
on a level field of play.

385
00:23:38,654 --> 00:23:41,365
"Gather one million dollars

386
00:23:41,448 --> 00:23:44,493
in unmarked,
non... consecutive twenties."

387
00:23:44,576 --> 00:23:47,496
- Weaklings!
- "Await instructions."

388
00:23:47,579 --> 00:23:49,373
- Bums!
- "No funny stuff."

389
00:23:49,456 --> 00:23:52,960
- Bummer.
- Huh?

390
00:23:53,043 --> 00:23:55,003
This is a bummer, man.

391
00:23:55,087 --> 00:23:56,964
That's, uh, that's a bummer.

392
00:23:57,047 --> 00:24:00,801
Brandt will
fill you in on the details.

393
00:24:14,856 --> 00:24:18,193
Mr Lebowski will make you
a generous offer

394
00:24:18,277 --> 00:24:22,322
to act as courier once we get
instructions for the money.

395
00:24:22,406 --> 00:24:23,865
Why me, man?

396
00:24:23,949 --> 00:24:27,035
He believes the culprits
might be the people

397
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:29,621
who, uh... soiled your rug,

398
00:24:29,705 --> 00:24:34,293
and you're in a unique position
to confirm or disconfirm this.

399
00:24:34,376 --> 00:24:36,670
He thinks
the carpet... pissers did this?

400
00:24:36,753 --> 00:24:39,298
Well, Dude, we just don't know.

401
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:17,771
Fucking Quintana.

402
00:26:17,854 --> 00:26:20,274
That creep can roll, man.

403
00:26:20,357 --> 00:26:22,401
Yeah, but he's a pervert, Dude.

404
00:26:22,484 --> 00:26:24,236
Yeah.

405
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:27,322
No. He's a sex offender
with a record.

406
00:26:27,406 --> 00:26:30,993
He did six months for exposing
himself to an 8... year... old.

407
00:26:31,076 --> 00:26:34,204
When he moved to Hollywood,
he had to go door... to... door

408
00:26:34,288 --> 00:26:36,081
to tell everyone
he was a pederast.

409
00:26:36,164 --> 00:26:38,542
What's a pederast, Walter?

410
00:26:38,625 --> 00:26:41,086
Shut the fuck up, Donny.

411
00:26:43,171 --> 00:26:46,758
- So... How much they give you?
- 20 grand, man.

412
00:26:46,842 --> 00:26:50,596
- And I get to keep the rug.
- Just for making a hand... off?

413
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:52,890
Yeah. They gave Dude a beeper.

414
00:26:52,973 --> 00:26:56,768
- So whenever they call...
- What if it's during a game?

415
00:26:56,852 --> 00:27:00,772
- If it's during league play...
- What's during league play?

416
00:27:00,856 --> 00:27:03,901
Life doesn't stop and start
at your convenience,

417
00:27:03,984 --> 00:27:07,112
- you piece of shit.
- What's wrong with Walter?

418
00:27:07,195 --> 00:27:09,865
I figure it's easy money.
It's harmless.

419
00:27:09,948 --> 00:27:13,535
- She probably did it herself.
- What do you mean, Dude?

420
00:27:13,619 --> 00:27:16,330
Rug pee... ers didn't do this.
Look at it.

421
00:27:16,413 --> 00:27:20,375
A young trophy wife
marries this guy for his money.

422
00:27:20,459 --> 00:27:22,878
She figures
he isn't giving her enough.

423
00:27:22,961 --> 00:27:24,922
You know, she owes money.

424
00:27:25,005 --> 00:27:28,759
- That fuckin'... bitch.
- It's all goddamn fake, man.

425
00:27:28,842 --> 00:27:31,011
It's like Lenin said.

426
00:27:31,094 --> 00:27:34,181
You look for the person
who will benefit,

427
00:27:34,264 --> 00:27:37,434
- and, uh, you know...
- I am the walrus?

428
00:27:37,517 --> 00:27:39,895
You know, you'll, uh...

429
00:27:39,978 --> 00:27:42,606
- You know what I'm saying.
- I am the walrus.

430
00:27:42,689 --> 00:27:44,524
That fuckin' bitch!

431
00:27:44,608 --> 00:27:47,444
- I am the walrus.
- Shut the fuck up, Donny!

432
00:27:47,527 --> 00:27:50,072
V.I. Lenin.
Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov!

433
00:27:50,155 --> 00:27:52,449
What the fuck
is he talking about?

434
00:27:52,532 --> 00:27:55,577
Fucking exactly what happened.
That makes me sick.

435
00:27:55,661 --> 00:27:58,372
- What do you care, Walter?
- Those rich fucks.

436
00:27:58,455 --> 00:28:00,290
This whole fuckin' thing.

437
00:28:00,374 --> 00:28:03,377
I didn't watch my buddies die
face... down in the mud

438
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:06,546
so that this fucking strumpet,
this fucking whore...

439
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:09,091
I don't see
any connection with Vietnam.

440
00:28:09,174 --> 00:28:10,676
No literal connection.

441
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:13,720
Face it, there's no
connection. Your roll.

442
00:28:13,804 --> 00:28:16,640
- But my point is...
- Your roll.

443
00:28:16,723 --> 00:28:18,725
Are you ready to be fucked?

444
00:28:19,685 --> 00:28:23,272
I see you roll your way
into the semis.

445
00:28:23,355 --> 00:28:26,024
Dios mio, man.

446
00:28:26,108 --> 00:28:29,194
Liam and me,
we're gonna fuck you up.

447
00:28:29,278 --> 00:28:33,657
Yeah? Well... you know,
that's just like, uh...

448
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,701
your opinion, man.

449
00:28:36,577 --> 00:28:39,371
Let me tell you
something, pendejo,

450
00:28:39,454 --> 00:28:42,499
you pull any crazy shit with us,

451
00:28:42,583 --> 00:28:44,960
you flash a piece out
on the lanes,

452
00:28:45,043 --> 00:28:48,130
I'll take it
and stick it up your ass

453
00:28:48,213 --> 00:28:51,383
and pull the fuckin' trigger
till it goes click.

454
00:28:52,134 --> 00:28:56,096
- Jesus.
- You said it, man.

455
00:28:56,179 --> 00:28:59,308
Nobody fucks with the Jesus.

456
00:29:04,187 --> 00:29:06,273
8... year... olds, Dude.

457
00:30:57,467 --> 00:31:00,220
Ohh, man.

458
00:31:10,314 --> 00:31:12,190
They called 80 minutes ago.

459
00:31:12,274 --> 00:31:15,068
Take the money,
drive north on the 405.

460
00:31:15,152 --> 00:31:18,322
They will call you with
instructions in 40 minutes.

461
00:31:18,405 --> 00:31:22,409
One person only. They were clear
on that, or I'd go with you.

462
00:31:22,492 --> 00:31:25,245
- What happened to your jaw?
- Oh, nothin'.

463
00:31:26,663 --> 00:31:30,500
Here's the money. And the phone.

464
00:31:30,584 --> 00:31:33,295
Please, Dude,
follow their instructions.

465
00:31:33,378 --> 00:31:34,838
All right.

466
00:31:34,922 --> 00:31:38,508
- Her life is in your hands.
- Oh, man, don't say that.

467
00:31:38,592 --> 00:31:40,594
Mr Lebowski asked me
to repeat that.

468
00:31:40,677 --> 00:31:43,013
- Her life is in your hands.
- Shit, man.

469
00:31:43,096 --> 00:31:44,932
Her life is in your hands, Dude.

470
00:31:45,015 --> 00:31:47,976
Report back to us
as soon as it's done.

471
00:31:56,777 --> 00:31:58,695
Where the fuck are you goin'?

472
00:31:58,779 --> 00:32:00,739
Take the ringer. I'll drive.

473
00:32:00,822 --> 00:32:03,492
- What? The what?
- The ringer.

474
00:32:03,575 --> 00:32:05,535
The ringer, Dude.

475
00:32:12,793 --> 00:32:15,170
- What the...
- Have they called?

476
00:32:15,254 --> 00:32:18,382
- What the hell is this?
- My dirty undies, Dude.

477
00:32:18,465 --> 00:32:21,051
Laundry. The whites.

478
00:32:21,134 --> 00:32:24,888
I'm sure there's a reason
you brought your dirty undies.

479
00:32:24,972 --> 00:32:27,140
The weight.
The ringer cannot look empty.

480
00:32:27,224 --> 00:32:29,059
What the fuck are you thinking?

481
00:32:29,142 --> 00:32:31,520
You're right, Dude.
I got to thinking,

482
00:32:31,603 --> 00:32:34,439
why should we settle for
a measly fuckin' 20 grand...

483
00:32:34,523 --> 00:32:37,359
We? You said
you just wanted to come along.

484
00:32:37,442 --> 00:32:39,861
Why should we settle
for 20 grand

485
00:32:39,945 --> 00:32:42,614
when we can keep
the entire million? Am I wrong?

486
00:32:42,698 --> 00:32:45,534
Yes, you're wrong.
This isn't a game, man.

487
00:32:45,617 --> 00:32:47,953
It is a game.
You said so yourself.

488
00:32:48,036 --> 00:32:50,706
- She kidnapped herself.
- I said I thought...

489
00:32:56,587 --> 00:32:57,629
Dude here.

490
00:32:57,713 --> 00:32:59,840
'Who is this? '

491
00:32:59,923 --> 00:33:03,552
Dude the bagman.
Where do you want us to go?

492
00:33:03,635 --> 00:33:06,513
- 'Us? '
- Shit!

493
00:33:08,557 --> 00:33:12,102
Yeah, you know,
me and the driver.

494
00:33:12,185 --> 00:33:15,522
I'm not handling the money,
driving the car...

495
00:33:15,606 --> 00:33:18,567
- 'Shut the fuck up! '
- Are you fucking this up?

496
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:20,736
Who is that?

497
00:33:20,819 --> 00:33:23,363
That is the driver.
I told you...

498
00:33:25,073 --> 00:33:27,576
- Shit!
- What the fuck's goin' on?

499
00:33:27,659 --> 00:33:29,828
- Walter!
- What the fuck is goin' on?

500
00:33:29,912 --> 00:33:33,248
He hung up! You fucked it up!
You fucked it up!

501
00:33:33,332 --> 00:33:36,168
- Her life was in our hands.
- Easy, Dude.

502
00:33:36,251 --> 00:33:38,629
We're screwed now.
We don't get shit.

503
00:33:38,712 --> 00:33:41,673
They're gonna kill her.
We're fucked, Walter.

504
00:33:41,757 --> 00:33:45,177
Nothing is fucked, Dude.
You're being very unDude.

505
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:47,596
They'll call back.
She kidnapped...

506
00:33:49,306 --> 00:33:52,643
You see?
Nothing's fucked here, Dude.

507
00:33:52,726 --> 00:33:55,145
They're a bunch
of fuckin' amateurs!

508
00:33:55,229 --> 00:33:57,606
Hey, will you shut the fuck up?

509
00:33:57,689 --> 00:34:00,609
Don't say peep
while I'm doin' business here.

510
00:34:00,692 --> 00:34:03,028
OK, Dude, have it your way.

511
00:34:04,112 --> 00:34:06,782
- But they're amateurs.
- Fuck.

512
00:34:08,075 --> 00:34:09,993
- Dude.
- 'OK, we proceed,

513
00:34:10,077 --> 00:34:12,246
'but only if there's
no funny stuff.'

514
00:34:12,329 --> 00:34:14,206
Yeah, yeah.

515
00:34:14,289 --> 00:34:16,333
'So no funny stuff, OK? '

516
00:34:16,416 --> 00:34:19,086
Just tell me
where the fuck to go.

517
00:34:22,839 --> 00:34:25,384
That was the sign, man.

518
00:34:25,467 --> 00:34:28,679
So all we gotta do
is get her back.

519
00:34:28,762 --> 00:34:32,015
No one can complain,
and we keep the baksheesh.

520
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:33,725
Terrific, Walter,

521
00:34:33,809 --> 00:34:36,353
but how are we
gonna get her back?

522
00:34:36,436 --> 00:34:38,438
That's the simple part, Dude.

523
00:34:38,522 --> 00:34:42,317
We make the hand... off,
I grab one, beat it out of him.

524
00:34:42,401 --> 00:34:45,696
- Huh?
- Yeah. That's a great plan.

525
00:34:45,779 --> 00:34:49,199
That's fucking ingenious,
if I understand it correctly.

526
00:34:49,283 --> 00:34:51,326
It's a Swiss fuckin' watch.

527
00:34:51,410 --> 00:34:54,288
Yeah, the beauty
of this is its simplicity.

528
00:34:54,371 --> 00:34:57,040
If it gets complex,
everything can go wrong.

529
00:34:57,124 --> 00:34:59,209
If I learned one thing
in 'Nam, it's...

530
00:35:03,005 --> 00:35:05,591
- Dude.
- 'You're coming to a bridge.

531
00:35:05,674 --> 00:35:07,593
'When you cross the bridge,

532
00:35:07,676 --> 00:35:12,055
'you throw the bag from the left
window. You're being watched.'

533
00:35:12,139 --> 00:35:13,682
Fuck!

534
00:35:13,765 --> 00:35:15,726
What'd he say?
Where's the hand... off?

535
00:35:15,809 --> 00:35:19,271
There isn't one, we throw
the money out of the car.

536
00:35:19,354 --> 00:35:22,900
We throw the money
out of the moving car!

537
00:35:22,983 --> 00:35:26,361
We can't do that.
That fucks up our plan.

538
00:35:26,445 --> 00:35:28,614
Call 'em and explain it to them.

539
00:35:28,697 --> 00:35:32,951
You're plan is so simple
I'm sure they'll understand.

540
00:35:33,035 --> 00:35:36,788
I'm throwin' the money, Walter.
We're not fuckin' around.

541
00:35:36,872 --> 00:35:39,166
Bridge is comin' up.
Give me the ringer.

542
00:35:39,249 --> 00:35:42,753
Fuck that. I love ya,
but you have to face the fact

543
00:35:42,836 --> 00:35:45,547
- you're a goddamn moron.
- No time to argue.

544
00:35:45,631 --> 00:35:47,299
- Hey, man.
- The bridge.

545
00:35:47,382 --> 00:35:49,843
Hey, Walter! Hey! Walter!

546
00:35:49,927 --> 00:35:52,137
There goes the ringer!

547
00:35:52,888 --> 00:35:54,973
- What the fuck?
- Here, your wheel.

548
00:35:55,057 --> 00:35:59,061
At 15 mph, I roll out,
grab one and beat it out of him.

549
00:35:59,144 --> 00:36:00,979
- The Uzi.
- Uzi?

550
00:36:01,063 --> 00:36:03,398
- I'm not rolling out naked.
- Walter, please!

551
00:36:03,482 --> 00:36:05,359
15, Dude. This is it.

552
00:36:27,798 --> 00:36:31,176
We have it! We have it!

553
00:36:32,386 --> 00:36:35,347
We have it!

554
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:37,558
We... have it!

555
00:36:50,946 --> 00:36:53,240
Aw, fuck it, Dude.

556
00:36:53,323 --> 00:36:55,409
Let's go bowling.

557
00:37:33,405 --> 00:37:36,617
Etz chaim he, Dude,
as the ex used to say.

558
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,744
What the fuck does that mean?

559
00:37:38,827 --> 00:37:41,330
What the fuck
are we gonna tell Lebowski?

560
00:37:41,413 --> 00:37:43,332
Huh? Oh, him. Uh...

561
00:37:45,542 --> 00:37:47,878
Well, what exactly
is the problem?

562
00:37:47,961 --> 00:37:50,005
The problem is...

563
00:37:50,088 --> 00:37:52,382
What do you mean, what's the...

564
00:37:52,466 --> 00:37:54,676
There was no...

565
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,304
We... we didn't, uh...

566
00:37:57,387 --> 00:38:00,224
They're gonna kill
that poor woman.

567
00:38:00,307 --> 00:38:02,434
The poor woman...

568
00:38:02,517 --> 00:38:06,146
That poor slut kidnapped
herself. You said so yourself.

569
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:08,815
I said I thought
she kidnapped herself.

570
00:38:08,899 --> 00:38:12,277
- You're the one who's certain.
- 100% certain.

571
00:38:12,361 --> 00:38:15,072
- They posted the next round.
- Shut the fuck...

572
00:38:15,155 --> 00:38:17,741
- When do we play?
- This Saturday.

573
00:38:17,824 --> 00:38:19,910
Saturday?
They have to reschedule.

574
00:38:19,993 --> 00:38:21,662
What am I gonna tell Lebowski?

575
00:38:21,745 --> 00:38:24,248
I told that fuck
at the league office...

576
00:38:24,331 --> 00:38:27,000
- Who's in charge of scheduling?
- Burkhalter.

577
00:38:27,084 --> 00:38:30,128
I told that kraut
I don't roll on Shabbos.

578
00:38:30,212 --> 00:38:33,173
- He already posted it.
- He can fuckin' unpost it!

579
00:38:33,257 --> 00:38:36,593
Who gives a shit?
They're gonna kill that woman.

580
00:38:36,677 --> 00:38:38,762
What am I gonna tell Lebowski?

581
00:38:38,845 --> 00:38:41,640
She'll get tired
of her game and go back.

582
00:38:41,723 --> 00:38:44,226
- Why not on Saturday?
- I'm Shomer Shabbos.

583
00:38:44,309 --> 00:38:46,019
What's that?

584
00:38:46,103 --> 00:38:48,063
What do I tell Lebowski?

585
00:38:48,146 --> 00:38:50,857
Saturday is Shabbos,
the Jewish day of rest.

586
00:38:50,941 --> 00:38:53,610
I don't work,
I don't drive a car,

587
00:38:53,694 --> 00:38:56,363
I don't handle money,
I don't turn on the oven,

588
00:38:56,446 --> 00:38:58,615
and I sure as shit
don't fucking roll!

589
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:00,492
Sheesh.

590
00:39:00,576 --> 00:39:02,786
Shomer Shabbos!

591
00:39:03,912 --> 00:39:06,957
- Walter, how am I gonna...
- Shomer fucking Shabbos.

592
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,586
- That's it! I'm outta here.
- Come on, Dude.

593
00:39:12,713 --> 00:39:14,506
Dude! Dude!

594
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:16,675
Look, you just tell him...

595
00:39:16,758 --> 00:39:19,928
Tell him we made the drop
and everything went...

596
00:39:20,012 --> 00:39:22,639
- How'd it go?
- Went all right.

597
00:39:22,723 --> 00:39:26,059
Walter, we didn't make
the fuckin' hand... off.

598
00:39:26,143 --> 00:39:29,229
They didn't get the fuckin'
money! They're gonna...

599
00:39:29,313 --> 00:39:33,984
They're gonna kill
that poor woman.

600
00:39:34,067 --> 00:39:37,029
If you can't go by car, how
do you get around on Shammos?

601
00:39:37,112 --> 00:39:38,989
Really, Dude, you surprise me.

602
00:39:39,072 --> 00:39:42,326
They're not gonna do shit.
What can they do to her?

603
00:39:42,409 --> 00:39:43,785
They're amateurs, and meanwhile,

604
00:39:43,869 --> 00:39:47,789
who's sittin' on a million
fucking dollars? Am I wrong?

605
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:51,793
Who's got a million
fuckin' dollars in our car?

606
00:39:51,877 --> 00:39:53,545
Our car, Walter?

607
00:39:53,629 --> 00:39:57,382
What do they got? My dirty
undies. My fuckin' whites.

608
00:40:01,845 --> 00:40:04,097
Say, Dude...

609
00:40:04,181 --> 00:40:07,100
where is your car?

610
00:40:07,184 --> 00:40:08,936
Who's got your undies?

611
00:40:09,019 --> 00:40:11,772
- Where's your car, Dude?
- You don't know?

612
00:40:11,855 --> 00:40:16,068
It was parked in a handicap
zone. Perhaps they towed it.

613
00:40:17,236 --> 00:40:20,072
You fuckin' know
it's been stolen.

614
00:40:20,155 --> 00:40:24,076
Well, certainly,
that's a possibility, Dude.

615
00:40:24,618 --> 00:40:26,954
Oh, fuck it.

616
00:40:28,288 --> 00:40:31,917
- Where you goin', Dude?
- I'm going home, Donny.

617
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,212
- Phone's ringing, Dude.
- Thank you, Donny.

618
00:40:48,433 --> 00:40:50,561
Uh... yeah...

619
00:40:53,105 --> 00:40:57,067
Green... uh, some brown or...

620
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:59,528
rust colouration.

621
00:40:59,611 --> 00:41:02,614
Was there anything
of value in the car?

622
00:41:02,698 --> 00:41:05,492
Oh. Uh, yeah...

623
00:41:05,576 --> 00:41:08,870
a tape deck,
some Creedence tapes,

624
00:41:08,954 --> 00:41:11,290
and there was a... uh...

625
00:41:12,708 --> 00:41:15,043
My briefcase.

626
00:41:15,919 --> 00:41:17,921
In the briefcase?

627
00:41:19,548 --> 00:41:22,259
Uh, papers.

628
00:41:22,342 --> 00:41:24,428
You know, just papers.

629
00:41:24,511 --> 00:41:27,848
You know, my papers.
Business papers.

630
00:41:29,725 --> 00:41:31,727
And what do you do, sir?

631
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:33,687
I'm unemployed.

632
00:41:36,481 --> 00:41:39,693
My rug was also stolen.

633
00:41:39,776 --> 00:41:42,070
Your rug was in the car?

634
00:41:42,154 --> 00:41:44,072
No, here.

635
00:41:44,156 --> 00:41:46,491
Separate incidents?

636
00:41:47,409 --> 00:41:50,162
'The Dude is not in... '

637
00:41:50,245 --> 00:41:53,457
Do you find them much,
these stolen cars?

638
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:56,251
Sometimes.

639
00:41:56,335 --> 00:42:00,172
- No hope for the tape deck.
- Or the Creedence.

640
00:42:00,255 --> 00:42:03,759
Well, what about, uh...

641
00:42:03,842 --> 00:42:05,510
The briefcase?

642
00:42:05,594 --> 00:42:08,347
'Mr Lebowski,
I'd like to see you.

643
00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:11,892
'My name is Maude Lebowski.
I'm the one who took your rug.'

644
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:17,105
Guess we can close
the file on that one.

645
00:43:03,777 --> 00:43:06,029
Elfranco, ayúdame abajo.

646
00:43:06,113 --> 00:43:10,409
I'll be with you
in a moment, Mr Lebowski.

647
00:43:28,677 --> 00:43:32,639
Does the female form make you
uncomfortable, Mr Lebowski?

648
00:43:32,723 --> 00:43:34,850
Is that what
this is a picture of?

649
00:43:34,933 --> 00:43:36,518
In a sense, yes.

650
00:43:36,602 --> 00:43:40,105
My art is strongly vaginal,
which bothers some men.

651
00:43:40,188 --> 00:43:44,318
The word itself makes some
men uncomfortable. Vagina.

652
00:43:44,401 --> 00:43:45,986
Oh, yeah?

653
00:43:46,069 --> 00:43:49,489
They find it difficult to say,
but without batting an eye,

654
00:43:49,573 --> 00:43:53,660
a man will refer to his dick
or his rod or his... johnson.

655
00:43:54,703 --> 00:43:57,331
- Johnson?
- All right, Mr Lebowski.

656
00:43:57,414 --> 00:43:59,207
Let's get down to cases.

657
00:43:59,291 --> 00:44:01,668
My father agreed
to let you have the rug,

658
00:44:01,752 --> 00:44:04,171
but it was a gift from me
to my late mother,

659
00:44:04,254 --> 00:44:06,214
and not his to give. Now...

660
00:44:06,298 --> 00:44:08,300
Your face.

661
00:44:08,383 --> 00:44:10,886
As for this kidnapping...

662
00:44:10,969 --> 00:44:15,140
I know all about it,
and that you acted as courier.

663
00:44:15,224 --> 00:44:19,436
Let me tell you something.
It stinks to high heaven.

664
00:44:19,519 --> 00:44:22,814
Right, but let me explain
something about the rug.

665
00:44:22,898 --> 00:44:26,235
- Do you like sex, Mr Lebowski?
- Excuse me?

666
00:44:26,318 --> 00:44:28,403
Sex. The physical act of love.

667
00:44:28,487 --> 00:44:30,572
Coitus. Do you like it?

668
00:44:30,656 --> 00:44:32,616
I was talking about my rug.

669
00:44:32,699 --> 00:44:36,203
- You're not interested in sex?
- You mean coitus?

670
00:44:36,286 --> 00:44:40,290
I like it. It's a myth about
feminists that we hate sex.

671
00:44:40,374 --> 00:44:44,378
It can be a natural, zesty
enterprise. But some people...

672
00:44:44,461 --> 00:44:47,172
satyriasis in men,
nymphomania in women...

673
00:44:47,256 --> 00:44:49,925
engage in it compulsively
and without joy.

674
00:44:50,008 --> 00:44:53,345
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes, Mr Lebowski.

675
00:44:53,428 --> 00:44:57,182
They cannot love
in the true sense of the word.

676
00:44:57,266 --> 00:45:00,686
Our mutual acquaintance,
Bunny, is one of these.

677
00:45:00,769 --> 00:45:02,729
Listen, Maude,

678
00:45:02,813 --> 00:45:06,692
um, I'm sorry if your
stepmother is a nympho,

679
00:45:06,775 --> 00:45:09,486
but what has that
to do with, uh...

680
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:13,323
- Do you have any Kahlua?
- Take a look at this, sir.

681
00:45:16,493 --> 00:45:18,954
Oh, I know that guy.

682
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:21,623
He's a nihilist.

683
00:45:23,041 --> 00:45:25,168
Karl Hungus...

684
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:41,059
- 'Hi.
- Hello. Meine dispatcher says

685
00:45:41,143 --> 00:45:43,854
'there's something
wrong mit deine kabel.

686
00:45:43,937 --> 00:45:47,190
'Come in. I'm not sure
exactly what's wrong.

687
00:45:47,274 --> 00:45:49,985
'Zat's why they sent me.
I am an expert.

688
00:45:50,068 --> 00:45:51,069
'The TV's in here.'

689
00:45:51,153 --> 00:45:53,488
You recognise her, of course.

690
00:45:57,492 --> 00:46:00,746
'That's my friend. She came
over to use the shower.'

691
00:46:00,829 --> 00:46:03,040
The story is ludicrous.

692
00:46:03,123 --> 00:46:06,209
'Meine name is Karl.
Ich bin expert.'

693
00:46:06,293 --> 00:46:08,170
'You're here to fix the cable.'

694
00:46:08,253 --> 00:46:11,840
You can imagine
where it goes from here.

695
00:46:11,924 --> 00:46:15,469
- He fixes the cable?
- Don't be fatuous, Jeffrey.

696
00:46:15,552 --> 00:46:18,889
Little matter that she pursues
a career in pornography

697
00:46:18,972 --> 00:46:21,225
nor that she's been
"banging" Jackie Treehorn,

698
00:46:21,308 --> 00:46:23,727
to use the parlance
of our times.

699
00:46:23,810 --> 00:46:27,689
But I am one of the two trustees
of the Lebowski Foundation,

700
00:46:27,773 --> 00:46:29,650
the other being my father.

701
00:46:29,733 --> 00:46:31,652
The Foundation
takes youngsters...

702
00:46:31,735 --> 00:46:33,570
Shit, yeah, the achievers.

703
00:46:33,654 --> 00:46:36,281
Little Lebowski
Urban Achievers, yes.

704
00:46:36,365 --> 00:46:39,493
I asked my father about
his withdrawal of $1 million,

705
00:46:39,576 --> 00:46:42,246
and he told me
about this abduction.

706
00:46:42,329 --> 00:46:45,290
It is preposterous.
This compulsive fornicator

707
00:46:45,374 --> 00:46:47,751
is taking my father
for the proverbial ride.

708
00:46:47,834 --> 00:46:50,170
- But my...
- I'm getting to your rug.

709
00:46:50,254 --> 00:46:52,130
My father and I don't get along.

710
00:46:52,214 --> 00:46:55,467
We don't approve
of each other's lifestyles.

711
00:46:55,551 --> 00:46:59,388
But I hardly wish to make his
embezzlement a police matter.

712
00:46:59,471 --> 00:47:03,809
I propose that you try
to recover the money.

713
00:47:03,892 --> 00:47:07,354
Well, I could do that.

714
00:47:07,437 --> 00:47:10,399
If you do so,
I will compensate you

715
00:47:10,482 --> 00:47:13,527
to the tune of 10%
of the recovered sum.

716
00:47:13,610 --> 00:47:15,195
A hundred...

717
00:47:15,279 --> 00:47:19,825
...thousand, yes, bones or clams
or whatever you call them.

718
00:47:19,908 --> 00:47:23,620
Yeah, but...
what about my, uh...

719
00:47:23,704 --> 00:47:26,790
Your rug. With that money
you can buy any rug

720
00:47:26,873 --> 00:47:29,543
that doesn't have
sentimental value for me.

721
00:47:29,626 --> 00:47:31,628
I am sorry about
that crack on the jaw.

722
00:47:31,712 --> 00:47:34,381
Oh, that's fine.
That doesn't even, uh...

723
00:47:34,464 --> 00:47:37,217
Here's the number of a doctor
who will look at it.

724
00:47:37,301 --> 00:47:40,178
You'll receive no bill.
He's a good man.

725
00:47:40,262 --> 00:47:43,098
- That's thoughtful, but...
- Please see him.

726
00:47:43,181 --> 00:47:45,017
He's a good man.

727
00:47:46,894 --> 00:47:49,521
Oh, well... all right.

728
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:52,941
He says, "My wife's a pain.

729
00:47:53,025 --> 00:47:54,943
"She's always bustin'
my friggin' agates.

730
00:47:54,985 --> 00:47:57,821
"My daughter's married
to a loser bastard,

731
00:47:57,905 --> 00:48:00,616
"and I got a rash
so bad on my ass

732
00:48:00,699 --> 00:48:04,536
"I can't sit down. But you
know me, can't complain."

733
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:07,789
Fuckin' A, man.
I got a rash, man.

734
00:48:07,873 --> 00:48:09,625
Fuckin' A.

735
00:48:09,708 --> 00:48:11,835
I gotta tell you, man,

736
00:48:11,919 --> 00:48:15,422
earlier in the day,
I was feeling shitty, man.

737
00:48:15,505 --> 00:48:17,174
Down in the dumps.

738
00:48:17,257 --> 00:48:19,301
Lost a little money...

739
00:48:19,384 --> 00:48:22,804
Hey, you know what?
Forget about it.

740
00:48:22,888 --> 00:48:26,683
I can't be worried about
that shit. Life goes on, man.

741
00:48:26,767 --> 00:48:28,727
Home, sweet home, Mr L.

742
00:48:32,356 --> 00:48:36,193
Look. Who's your friend
in the Volkswagen?

743
00:48:37,986 --> 00:48:40,864
Yeah, he followed us here.

744
00:48:40,948 --> 00:48:44,243
When did he start foll...
What the fuck?

745
00:48:44,326 --> 00:48:46,912
In the limo, you son of a bitch.
No arguing.

746
00:48:46,995 --> 00:48:49,331
Careful, man.
There's a beverage here.

747
00:48:50,624 --> 00:48:53,627
Start talking and talk fast,
you lousy bum.

748
00:48:53,710 --> 00:48:56,129
We've been trying
to reach you, Dude.

749
00:48:56,213 --> 00:48:59,049
Where's my goddamn money,
you bum?

750
00:48:59,132 --> 00:49:01,009
W... well, we...

751
00:49:01,093 --> 00:49:02,844
I don't...

752
00:49:02,928 --> 00:49:06,098
They did not receive
the money, you nitwit!

753
00:49:06,181 --> 00:49:09,977
- Her life was in your hands!
- This is our concern, Dude.

754
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:12,646
No, man, nothing is fucked here.

755
00:49:12,729 --> 00:49:14,731
- Nothing is fucked?
- No, man.

756
00:49:14,815 --> 00:49:18,026
The goddamn plane
has crashed into the mountain!

757
00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:21,905
Come on, who are you gonna
believe, those guys or...

758
00:49:21,989 --> 00:49:24,116
We dropped off the damn money.

759
00:49:24,199 --> 00:49:26,118
We?

760
00:49:26,201 --> 00:49:28,245
I.

761
00:49:28,328 --> 00:49:32,040
The royal we.
You know, the editorial.

762
00:49:32,124 --> 00:49:34,835
I dropped off the money
exactly as per...

763
00:49:34,918 --> 00:49:37,337
I've got certain
information, all right?

764
00:49:37,421 --> 00:49:40,132
Certain things
have come to light, and...

765
00:49:40,215 --> 00:49:42,759
Has it ever occurred to you

766
00:49:42,843 --> 00:49:47,055
that instead of,
you know, running around,

767
00:49:47,139 --> 00:49:50,893
blaming me, given the nature
of all this new shit,

768
00:49:50,976 --> 00:49:54,813
this could be a lot more...

769
00:49:54,897 --> 00:49:56,899
Complex?

770
00:49:56,982 --> 00:50:01,320
I mean, it might not be
such a simple, uh... you know?

771
00:50:01,403 --> 00:50:04,489
What in God's name
are you blathering about?

772
00:50:04,573 --> 00:50:08,035
I'll tell you
what I'm blathering about.

773
00:50:08,118 --> 00:50:11,413
I've got information.
New shit has come to light.

774
00:50:11,496 --> 00:50:13,707
And, shit, man...

775
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:17,502
She kidnapped herself.

776
00:50:19,796 --> 00:50:21,632
Well, sure, man.

777
00:50:21,715 --> 00:50:24,718
Look at it.
A young trophy wife,

778
00:50:24,801 --> 00:50:27,054
in the parlance of our times.

779
00:50:27,137 --> 00:50:30,182
She owes money all over town,

780
00:50:30,265 --> 00:50:33,268
including to
known pornographers.

781
00:50:34,228 --> 00:50:37,314
And that's cool. That's cool.

782
00:50:37,397 --> 00:50:40,525
I'm saying she needs money, man.

783
00:50:40,609 --> 00:50:42,861
And... and, you know,

784
00:50:42,945 --> 00:50:45,989
of course they're gonna say
they didn't get it,

785
00:50:46,073 --> 00:50:49,159
because she wants more, man.

786
00:50:49,243 --> 00:50:52,579
She's gotta feed the monkey.
I mean...

787
00:50:54,206 --> 00:50:58,001
Hasn't that ever
occurred to you, man? Sir?

788
00:51:00,254 --> 00:51:04,007
No, Mr Lebowski,
it had not occurred to me.

789
00:51:04,091 --> 00:51:07,594
That had not occurred
to us, Dude.

790
00:51:07,678 --> 00:51:10,931
You guys aren't privy
to all the new shit, so...

791
00:51:11,014 --> 00:51:13,225
you know. But...

792
00:51:13,308 --> 00:51:16,603
Hey, that's what you pay me for.

793
00:51:18,313 --> 00:51:21,525
Speaking of which,
do you think that you could...

794
00:51:21,608 --> 00:51:23,735
give me my 20,000 in cash?

795
00:51:23,819 --> 00:51:27,322
My concern is... and I gotta
check with my accountant...

796
00:51:27,406 --> 00:51:30,158
but this might bump me
into a higher tax...

797
00:51:30,242 --> 00:51:32,578
Brandt... Give him the envelope.

798
00:51:32,661 --> 00:51:36,790
Oh, if you've already got the
cheque made out, that's coolOOOh

799
00:51:36,873 --> 00:51:39,376
We received this this morning.

800
00:51:40,669 --> 00:51:44,256
Since you have
failed to achieve,

801
00:51:44,339 --> 00:51:47,759
even in the modest task
which was your charge,

802
00:51:47,843 --> 00:51:51,597
since you have stolen my money,

803
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:54,850
since you have unrepentantly
betrayed my trust...

804
00:51:54,933 --> 00:51:56,727
I have no choice

805
00:51:56,810 --> 00:52:01,815
but to tell these bums
to do whatever is necessary

806
00:52:01,899 --> 00:52:06,904
to recover their money
from you, Jeffrey Lebowski.

807
00:52:06,987 --> 00:52:10,574
With Brandt as my witness,
I will tell you this:

808
00:52:10,657 --> 00:52:15,162
Any further harm
visited upon Bunny

809
00:52:15,245 --> 00:52:18,749
will be visited tenfold
upon your head.

810
00:52:21,168 --> 00:52:26,298
By God, sir, I will not
abide another toe.

811
00:52:31,595 --> 00:52:34,431
That wasn't her toe, Dude.

812
00:52:34,514 --> 00:52:38,435
- Whose toe was it, Walter?
- How the fuck should I know?

813
00:52:38,518 --> 00:52:41,104
Nothing about it indicates...

814
00:52:41,188 --> 00:52:43,690
- The nail polish, Walter.
- Fine, Dude.

815
00:52:43,774 --> 00:52:47,861
You can get nail polish and
apply it to someone else's toe.

816
00:52:47,945 --> 00:52:49,947
Where the fuck
are they gonna get...

817
00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:53,033
You want a toe?
I can get you a toe.

818
00:52:53,116 --> 00:52:55,285
Believe me,
there are ways, Dude.

819
00:52:55,369 --> 00:52:57,537
You don't wanna know about it.

820
00:52:57,621 --> 00:53:01,500
I can get you a toe
by 3 pm, with nail polish.

821
00:53:01,583 --> 00:53:04,586
These fuckin' amateurs.
They send us a toe,

822
00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:08,257
we're supposed to shit ourselves
with fear. Jesus Christ!

823
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:11,426
They're gonna kill her
and then me.

824
00:53:11,510 --> 00:53:14,888
Dude... that's...

825
00:53:14,972 --> 00:53:17,891
That's just
the stress talking, man.

826
00:53:17,975 --> 00:53:20,185
We have what appears to me

827
00:53:20,269 --> 00:53:22,938
to be a series
of victimless crimes.

828
00:53:23,021 --> 00:53:27,359
- What about the toe?
- Forget about the fucking toe!

829
00:53:27,442 --> 00:53:30,654
Could you keep your voices down?
This is a family restaurant.

830
00:53:30,737 --> 00:53:32,990
Dear, for your information,

831
00:53:33,073 --> 00:53:36,535
the Supreme Court
has rejected prior restraint!

832
00:53:36,618 --> 00:53:38,412
This is not
a First Amendment thing.

833
00:53:38,495 --> 00:53:41,665
If you don't calm down,
you'll have to leave.

834
00:53:41,748 --> 00:53:45,043
Lady, my buddies died
face... down in the muck

835
00:53:45,127 --> 00:53:48,088
so we could enjoy
this family restaurant!

836
00:53:48,171 --> 00:53:50,924
- I'm outta here.
- Dude, don't go away, man.

837
00:53:51,008 --> 00:53:52,885
This affects all of us.

838
00:53:52,968 --> 00:53:54,803
There are basic freedoms!

839
00:53:59,391 --> 00:54:01,685
I'm stayin'.

840
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:05,022
I'm finishing my coffee.

841
00:54:10,235 --> 00:54:12,905
Enjoying my coffee.

842
00:54:28,003 --> 00:54:31,048
'The Dude is not in.

843
00:54:31,131 --> 00:54:34,092
'Leave a message after the beep.
Thanks, man.'

844
00:54:35,552 --> 00:54:38,931
'Mr Lebowski, this is duty
officer Rolvaag of the LAPD.

845
00:54:39,014 --> 00:54:41,266
'We've recovered
your automobile.

846
00:54:41,350 --> 00:54:43,393
'It can be claimed at... '

847
00:54:43,477 --> 00:54:46,313
Far out, man. Far fucking out!

848
00:54:56,323 --> 00:54:59,576
Hey! This is
a private residence, man.

849
00:55:08,335 --> 00:55:10,671
Ah, nice marmot.

850
00:55:19,179 --> 00:55:24,810
Vere is the money, Lebowski.
Ve vant the money, Lebowski.

851
00:55:29,648 --> 00:55:33,860
You zink ve are kidding
or making with the funny stuff?

852
00:55:33,944 --> 00:55:36,697
Things you haven't
dreamed of, Lebowski.

853
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:39,616
Ve believes in nossing,
Lebowski, nossing.

854
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:42,578
Ve come back
and ve cut off your chonson.

855
00:55:42,661 --> 00:55:44,162
Excuse me?

856
00:55:44,246 --> 00:55:47,207
I said we'll
cut off your johnson!

857
00:55:47,291 --> 00:55:49,209
Just think about that, Lebowski.

858
00:55:49,293 --> 00:55:51,211
Ja, your viggly penis, Lebowski.

859
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:54,089
Maybe we stomp on it
and sqoosh it, Lebowski.

860
00:56:03,515 --> 00:56:05,434
It was discovered last night

861
00:56:05,517 --> 00:56:08,729
- lodged against an abutment.
- Oh, man, lodged where?

862
00:56:08,812 --> 00:56:11,982
You're lucky she didn't
get chopped, Mr Lebowski.

863
00:56:12,065 --> 00:56:13,942
A joyride situation.

864
00:56:14,026 --> 00:56:16,904
They abandon the vehicle
once they hit the wall.

865
00:56:16,987 --> 00:56:20,365
My fucking briefcase!
Man, it's not here. Shit!

866
00:56:20,449 --> 00:56:22,200
I saw the report. Sorry.

867
00:56:22,284 --> 00:56:24,786
You gotta get in
on the other side.

868
00:56:24,870 --> 00:56:29,416
The side... view was found
on the road by the car.

869
00:56:29,499 --> 00:56:33,378
You're lucky they left the
tape deck, and the Creedence.

870
00:56:33,462 --> 00:56:37,007
Aw, Jesus!
What's that smell, man?
