好像我們之間有化學反應 即使是通過電話
It's like we have chemistry, even over our phones.
像是短信化學反應
Like text chemistry.
正是
Exactly.
就在Kendal按下"發送"鍵時 Ryan的一條短信就奇跡般蹦出來了

It is way more complicated than you can possibly ever understand, OK?
Buddy Slade和我有多少年的感情了
Buddy Slade and I have years and years of history,
深厚而複雜的感情

some of the new oak.
- 哦 拜託  - 好吧
- Oh, come on.  - OK.
這味道藏在裡面
They're kind of hidden in there.
所以當你小口抿的時候...
So when you sip...
- 我應該小口抿的?  - 是的
- I was supposed to sip it?  - Yeah.
我們再來一點...
Let's do a little...
嘗嘗吧
There you go.
木頭味
Woody.
橡木
Oak.
你那次約會後來如何?
So how'd the rest of your little date go?
- 很好 大開眼界了  - 是嗎?
- Good. It was eye-opening.  - Yeah?
我是說 Buddy顯然過得不幸福
I mean, Buddy's clearly not happy.
好吧 他親口說的?
OK, he actually said that?
他暗示了
He implied it.
你能看得出來 他很痛苦
You can tell, he's totally suffering.
他看起來精疲力盡
He looks completely exhausted.
知道嗎 他告訴我他活得像個殭屍
You know he told me he feels like a zombie.
我當時也在 好吧? 我覺得他只是在抱怨一下啊
I was there, all right? I suspect he was being flip.
那可不只是抱怨那麼簡單的
That's a pretty strong statement to make.
我是說 殭屍可是死人 不是...
I mean, a zombie is a dead person, not...
Mavis 我是個胖宅 好吧? 我知道殭屍是什麼
Mavis, I'm a fat geek, all right? I know what a zombie is.
我覺得Buddy跟我有一樣的感覺
I think Buddy and I are having very similar feelings.
問題是 誰會先說出來?
The question is, who's gonna make the first move?
我覺得... 應該是你
I'm thinking... it will be you.
- 你這麼大了還看特種部隊啊?  - 那個還沒干呢
- Aren't you a little old for G. I. Joes?  - That one's still wet.
沒事的 老天
No, it's fine. Jesus.
- 你自己做的?  - 我只是把它們混合 組裝起來而已
- You make these?  - I combine them, mix and match.
那個... 我取下了銅頭蛇的頭 安到Mongul的身上去了
That one... I took Copperhead's face, and I put it on Mongul's body,
感覺像加強版的銅頭蛇
so it's like a beefed-up Copperhead,
然後又放了只午夜神醫的貓頭鷹
and then I added Doctor Mid-Nite's owl.
我當時累壞了 又喝了點小酒
I was tired and drunk.
你做過女生玩的洋娃娃嗎?
You ever make, like, girl dolls?
我又不是變態
I'm not a weirdo.
我要去弄清一些事
I have to go check on something.
哦 去吧
Oh, OK.
不 不 你得和我一起去
No, no, no. You need to come with me.
我覺得就是這兒了
I think this is it.
你覺得還是你確定?
You think, or you know?
絕對是這兒 他開的是吉普自由
This is definitely it. He drives a Jeep Liberty.
真是諷刺啊... 因為他一點自由都沒有
That's ironic... because he has no liberty.
你他媽精神病犯了吧
You're fuckin' mentally ill.
- 看到那邊窗戶了嗎?  - 看到了
- You see that window up there?  - Yep.
我打賭Buddy還沒睡...
I bet Buddy is awake...
也許在打手槍
jerking off or something.
或著正在照顧他的寶貝女兒
Or perhaps he's caring for his infant daughter.
孩子啊 孩子啊
The baby, the baby.
莫名的麻煩啊
The problem that has no name.
我能幫您找什麼嗎?
Can I help you find something?
當然 我運氣真不好
Sure, I'm not having a ton of luck here.
- 是找工作時穿的嗎?  - 不 是個特別的場合
- Is this something for work?  - No, it's a special occasion.
不是正式的場合
It's not a formal occasion.
我想要一件時髦而且整潔 但又有一點煩躁的衣服
I'm looking for something chic, clean, but also a bit edgy.
好的 我們店裡剛來了一批漂亮的女裝
OK. We have some adorable new dresses that just came in.
- 有沒有Marc Jacobs的?  - 不好意思 這個沒有
- Yeah, do you have Marc Jacobs?  - No, I don't think we have that one.
我要和舊情人去看搖滾演唱會
I'm going to a rock concert with an old flame,
也許有機會能復合的
and I think there is a chance we may reconnect.
那就讓他瞧瞧他錯過了什麼
Let's show him what he's been missing.
不用 我們最近見過面 他知道的
No, he's seen me recently. He knows.
但他的妻子很久沒見過我了 所以...
But his wife hasn't seen me in a while, so...
不好意思 我要下班了
Well, it's the end of my shift,
我還得去學校接孩子
and my son has to be picked up from school.
所以我讓另一個同事來接待你吧
So I'm just gonna send over another associate.
她對時尚很瞭解
She's up on all the trends.
Shawna啊!

哇
Wow.
看來是相當受歡迎呢
They must be really popular.
其實 我們庫存過剩了 現在要處理了
Actually, we just got a lot of surplus stock we're trying to clear out.
幾年前 它們確實挺火的	
They were big a couple years ago,
但現在電腦顯示"盡快下架" 所以...
but the computer says, "Do not shelve," so...
嘿 你是在寫字嗎?
Hey, are you writing in there?

Yes, I know her really well.
- 我是作者  - 好的

要不要給你們書店來一份簽名版?
Do you want a signed copy for your store?
不用了 謝謝
No, that's fine.
你要多少我就可以簽多少 幫你們升值的
I can sign as many as you want. It adds value to your stock.
好吧 但是書籍一旦被簽了名 我們就不能退給出版商了
Yeah, but once merchandise is signed, we can't send it back to the publisher.
你們為什麼要退給出版商?
Why would you be sending it back to the publisher?
我們很可能賣不出去了
We're probably not gonna sell them.
這個系列已經完了
The series is done.
拜託 我說了不能在上面...
Come on, I told you you can't write in the...
隨你便 個賣書的
Whatever, book man.
Kendal Strickland從沒感到有威脅

It wasn't her fault that one year she was nominated homecoming queen...
而且還是被鄰近的高中
of a neighboring high school.
是的 Kendal Strickland很有魅力 這很顯然
Yes, Kendal Strickland was attractive. That was obvious.
其他的女孩都充滿了不安
Other girls were so insecure,
天天都在糾結自己的臉孔和身材 Kendal從來不用
stressing about their faces and their figures, not Kendal.
她天生麗質 由內而外地散發出優雅的美
Hers was a gracious, effortless beauty that glowed from within.
然而 太漂亮了有時也可能嚇跑別人
However, being that beautiful could also be intimidating.
有些男孩兒更喜歡平凡一點的女生

I mean, I named him Ashby, but it's so blatantly you.
- 你一看就知道了  - 希望是個帥傢伙
- When you read it, it'll be obvious.  - Hope he's cool.
我們可不能那樣做
We're not even supposed to do that.
我們得堅持我們的創作原則...
We're supposed to stick to this character bible...

- 哪一件?  - 我會告訴你?
- Which one? - Like I'd tell you.
那個表是做什麼的?
What's the chart?
Beth在給有特殊需要的兒童上課
Beth teaches special needs kids.
我教的很多孩子 需要通過認知來學習情感
A lot of my kids learn emotions cognitively.
不像我們 很自然地就會了
It doesn't come naturally to them the way it does for you and me.
所以我們教給他們 "這是快樂的樣子"
So we need to show them "this is what happy looks like,"
"這是焦急的樣子" 等等
"this is what anxious looks like," and so on.
那平淡的樣子呢?
What about neutral?
我是說 什麼感覺都沒有的時候呢?
I mean, like, what if you don't feel anything?
他們很多時候就是那個樣子的
That's kind of how they are a lot of the time.
所以 這個不用教
So, yeah, don't need to teach it.
哦 天吶
Oh, my God.
- 那是Mavis Gary嗎?  - 是的
- Is that Mavis Gary?  - Yeah.
你能相信嗎? 她居然跟Beth和Buddy一起過來

Well, they have a lot of fun.

He's just always lurking, isn't he? So creepy. Look at his face.
慘白慘白的 像個殺人犯
He's so doughy. He's like a murderer.
不知道他有沒有小丑裝?
Think he owns any clown suits?
- 哦 你太可怕了  - 拜託

Well, the wedding wasn't a failure.
- 還記得提拉米蘇嗎?  - 我喜歡那時的Allen
- Remember the tiramisu?  - I liked that Allen.
老爸 他是我前夫 你應該跟我站在一邊的
Dad, he's my ex-husband. You're supposed to be on my team.
他是個不錯的小伙兒 僅此而已 我沒偏向誰啊
He's a nice guy, that's all. I didn't know there were teams.
這次回來 你有拜訪老友嗎?
Have you seen any old friends on this visit?
其實...
Actually...
我最近經常跟Buddy見面
I've been seeing quite a bit of Buddy.
哦 那個老不正經啊 嗯?
Oh, the old beau, huh?
我記得 你們在高中的時候 可愛死了
I remember you kids were so cute in high school.
天性對人的影響還真是大啊 是不是?
It's funny how those initial instincts can be so right, you know?
我是說 人們總會不停地犯錯
I mean, you make all these mistakes along the way,
但最終命運還是會讓你遇到你的真命天子
but the world will make sure you end up with the person you're meant to be with.
能和這些人保持聯繫 這樣很好
It's good to keep those people in your life.
因為他們都非常的瞭解你
The people who really know you best.
他的孩子真是可愛極了
And that new baby of his is just darling.
你見過小孩了嗎? 親眼見過嗎?
Have you seen it? Up close?
見過了
I suppose.
沒事吧?
Is everything OK?
會沒事的 可能現在說有點言之過早吧
I'm sure it will be fine. It's probably too soon to tell.
但 Buddy曾說過...
It's just that Buddy used to say that...
我們會生出來世界上最可愛的孩子的
we would make the cutest little babies, ever.
嘿 你們把我的蓬式汽車賣了嗎?
Hey, did you guys ever sell my Cabriolet?
哇! 真炫的車啊
Yeah! Sweet ride.
那是什麼車 是敞篷的嗎?
What is that, a drop-top?
我剛去見了我爸和我媽
I just saw my mother and father.
哦 心情沉重啊 他們怎麼樣?
Oh, heavy. How are they?
很恐怖 天啊 跟他們在一起太難熬了
Horrible. God, I've been through a lot.
- 要來點酒嗎?  - 不然你以為我來幹嘛來了?
- Wanna get hammered?  - Why do you think I'm here?
走 我們去學校後面的樹林裡喝 
Come on. Let's hit the woods in the back of the school.
- 拿上那瓶星球大戰果汁  - 那是限量版的...
And grab some of that Star Wars juice. - That's a limited...
- 別婆婆媽媽的了!  - 好吧
- Come on!  - Fine.
你還能再慢點嗎?
Could you walk any slower?
咱學校真是醜死了
Our school is so ugly.
跟個破工廠一樣
It looks like a factory.
實際上在20年代 這裡就是一個橡膠加工廠
It actually used to be a rubber fabrication plant back in the '20s.
你真是百事通啊
You know everything.
那時候這片樹林就像Hump City一樣
These woods were like Hump City back in the day.
我記得我曾跟不同的男人來這裡
I remember being back here with a few different guys.
我從沒想到你這麼浪蕩
I never knew you were such a slut.
我只是個正常人而已
I was normal.
你跟老Buddy之間怎麼樣了 嗯?
So how are things with old Buddy, huh?
你的大計進展怎麼樣了?
How's the master plan unfolding?
呃 實際上 他今天給我打電話了
Well, actually, he called me today
問我想不想參加他孩子的命名禮
and asked me if I wanted to participate in his baby's naming ceremony.
我也不知道
I don't know.
我們還有很多話沒有說開 但...
There's still so much that's unspoken, but...
他這是在把我扯進他孩子的生活當中
he's involving me in his child's life.
Buddy是個已婚男人
Buddy is a married man.
大家都說他很幸福
By all accounts, happily.
是啊 幸福的已婚男人一直
Yeah, happily married men go to bars alone
跟他前女友泡酒吧
with their ex-girlfriends all the time.
他們說是地下情 但卻在大門前上接吻
They call them privately, and they make out with them on porches.
- 他沒有親你  - 你又不在場
- He did not make out with you.  - You weren't there.
我們接吻了 炙熱而激烈
We made out. It was intense and passionate.
他還把他的運動衫送給了我
He gave me his sweatshirt.
是啊 我注意到了 是個人都能注意到吧
Yes, I noticed. They probably noticed in space.
順便說下 這衣服你穿著 真醜
And FYI, you look completely insane wearing it.
聽著 我不知道Buddy和你到底是怎麼回事
Look, I don't know what Buddy's doing with you,
或者你覺得你們之間有什麼 但你得向前看
or what you think he's doing with you, but you need to move on.
你不想發表意見
You don't want to talk.
你只記得20年前的那場混戰
All you care about is some scuffle that happened 20 years ago.
你靠著枴杖走路 你依靠借口生活
You lean on that crutch, and you lean on excuses,
我們都知道 你用整件事當做借口
and you and I both know you use this whole thing
來做一些和你的生活無任何關係的事
as an excuse to do absolutely nothing with your life.
"混戰"
"Scuffle."
你一點都不瞭解我的遭遇
You don't know shit about what happened to me.
你知道嗎? 那些你在午餐時一直纏著的混蛋們...
OK? Those jocks you used to blow during lunch...
他們打殘了我的腿
they shattered my legs,
打壞了我的腦子
bashed in my brains,
折斷了我的老二
mangled my cock,
這樣我以後就不能正常的解決生理問題
so that I have to piss and cum sideways for the rest of my life.
然後他們不顧死活地拋下了我
Then they left me for dead.
你知道嗎 之後的情況也不容樂觀
You know, things aren't too great down south.
我自己幾乎都動不了 更不用說誰願意跟我一起了
I can barely get off by myself, let alone with another person.
知道嗎 往事已矣
You know, what's done is done.
人不能抓住過去不放 Matt
You can't keep dwelling on the past, Matt.
你他媽的開玩笑吧?
Are you fucking kidding?
說到抓住過去不放
Talk about dwelling in the past.
現在你回到了Mercury 像個失敗者一樣
Here you are back in Mercury, like a loser,
想和一個幸福的已婚男人糾纏不清
trying to score with a happily married man.
Buddy不幸福 好不好? 別再說他幸福了
Buddy's not happy, OK? So just stop saying that.
他幸不幸福不應該由你來說 Sylvia
You're hardly the authority on happiness, Sylvia.
知道嗎 Matt?
You know what, Matt?
你真該為你自己這樣子而感到恥辱
It really is a shame that you're like this,
如果你的性格很好
because if you had a good personality,
那些人是不會欺負你的
none of this other stuff would bother people.
你怎麼不拿我的枴杖繼續諷刺了?
Why don't you use my crutch again as a metaphor?
那樣很聰明啊 你很擅長啊 
That was brilliant. That was masterful.
算了 還是留著去講你小年輕人的故事吧
Or no, save it for your little teenage stories,
因為上帝知道 對於成人的生活 你屁都不懂!
because God knows you don't know shit about being an adult!
Kendal Strickland這已經不是第一次失望了
It wasn't the first time Kendal Strickland was let down.
他們所作的一切善事 美麗和知名度都沒有讓他們獲得更多的忠誠
For all the good they did, beauty and popularity didn't inspire much loyalty.
如果有同伴的話 會不會好點? 那些她能尊重的朋友呢?
Would it be nice to have peers? Friends she could respect?
當然會 但Kendal清楚的知道 作為另類 這條路還很長
Sure, but Kendal knew the lone march of being special a little too well.
她習慣了以自己的方式生活
She was used to blazing her own trail.
很顯然 Ryan仍愛著她 真真切切
It was obvious that Ryan still loved her, crystal clear.
也許 這對於她的新女友並不公平
And perhaps that was unfair to his new girlfriend,
但Kendal Strickland將會考慮改變自己
but Kendal Strickland was going to think about herself for a change.
那誰來照顧Kendal呢?
Who was taking care of Kendal?
而對於公平而言...
And on the subject of fair...
人們只因為Kendal太美 就蔑視她的智商
was it fair that people misjudged Kendal's intelligence
那這樣公平嗎?
just because she was so beautiful?
當她生活窘迫 而人們卻認為她過得瀟灑自在 這樣公平嗎?
Was it fair everyone thought her life was so easy, when it was anything but?
不 生活本就是不公平的
No. Life wasn't fair,
做出改變 扭轉局面 這一切最終還是取決於Kendal
and it was up to Kendal to step in and make things right.
有時為了療傷 一些人不得不受傷害
Sometimes in order to heal, a few people have to get hurt.
嗨 Jan
Hi, Jan.
哦 嗨
Oh, hi.

Can you help Beth with that endive thing?
- 好的 祖母就是用來救急的  - 我們能談談嗎?
- Yeah, Grandma to the rescue.  - Can we talk?
可以
Yeah.
怎麼樣? 還開心吧? 出去玩去吧 小Carter
Are you having fun? Are you having fun? Get out of here, Carter-bug.
我們還是私下談一下吧
I think we should talk privately.
好的 沒問題
Sure, yeah.
跟我來
Here, follow me.
好的
OK.
行了 怎麼了?
OK, so what's going on?
我知道我們都有很多話要說
There are so many things I know we both wanna say.
好吧 呃 我們沒必要現在全部說完
OK, well, we don't have to say them all now.
我還要準備Beth的禮物 我給她買了架子鼓
I gotta get Beth's gift ready. I got her a drum set.
你真是貼心 這麼忙也不會忘記
You're so thoughtful, even during all this.
呃 她一直念叨個不停
Well, hey, she pushed it out.
我只想讓你知道 我跟你的感覺完全一樣
I just want you to know that I'm feeling everything that you're feeling.
Buddy 過去的幾天是我一生中最快樂的時光
Buddy, these last few days have been some of the best in my life.
是嗎?
They have?
你不用裝了
You don't have to pretend.
我知道你腦子裡想的什麼...
I know what's in here...
也知道你心裡的想法
and I know what's in here.
Buddy... 你是我的月亮 我的星星
Buddy... you're my moon, my stars.
你就是我的全世界
You're my whole galaxy.
Mavis! 你幹什麼啊?
Mavis! What are you doing?
好吧
OK.
別擔心啊 沒事的
You don't have to be afraid. It's OK.
你可以和我一起去城裡的 就像以前我們一起計劃的一樣
You can come to the city with me, like we always planned.
你在亂說些什麼啊?
What the hell are you talking about?
我們會有辦法的 你知道的 我們會像成年人一樣解決這些的
We can work this out. You know we can. We can handle this like adults.
- Mavis 我已經結婚了  - 我知道了 我們可以一起挺過去的
- Mavis, I'm a married man.  - I know. We can beat this together.
沒想到你是這個樣子
You're better than this.
我要下去了
I have to go.
我想 你最好還是走吧
I think you should leave.
嘿 看看誰起來了
Hey, look who's up.
嘿 讓我抱抱
Hey, let me take her.
讓我來... 來爸爸這裡
Let me... Come here.
小寶貝
There you are.
你能幫我個忙嗎?
Can you do me a favor?
請大伙到外面去一下
We need everybody outside.
- 我要準備一下給Beth的禮物  - 好的
- I wanna get Beth's gift ready.  - Yeah.
這些太好吃了
Those are delicious.
嘿 夥計們 看這邊!
Hey, listen up, everyone!
我想 Buddy給Beth準備了個小驚喜
I think Buddy has a little surprise for Beth,
所以請大家出去一下 到院子裡待一會兒
so if you could all just come outside and gather around the garage.
拜託大家了
Come on, let's go.
Mavis啊?
Mavis?
- 幹嘛?  - 你沒事吧?
- What?  - Are you OK?
你要給我點酒喝的話 就沒事了
I'll be fine if I can get a real drink around here.
這裡就有些 謝謝 Bob叔叔
There's some right here. Thanks, Uncle Bob.
你知道嗎?
You know what?
我的天啊
Oh, my God.
- 我給你拿點...  - 我操
- I'll get some...  - Fuck you.
我操!
Fuck you!
我操你個賤人!
You fucking bitch!
我的天啊
Oh, my God.
你應該好好瞧瞧你的臉
You should see your face.
開個玩笑而已
It's a joke.
你就打算像個木頭一樣柞在這裡嗎?
Are you just gonna stand there like a big lump?
我好喜歡你的毛衣啊
I love your sweater.
我給你拿塊布
I'll get you a rag.
去給我拿塊布吧 反正你這裡多的是各種布
Go get me a rag, 'cause you got so many of those lying around here.
什麼打嗝布啊 隨便了
Fuckin' burp cloths, whatever.
你知道可笑的地方在哪裡嗎?
You know, the funny thing is?
我很久之前就能有這個派對了
I could have had this party a long time ago.
和這個一模一樣的派對 沒錯
This exact same party. Yeah.
Buddy和我在一起四年了
Buddy and I were together for four years,
我們如膠似漆 Jan知道的
and we were inseparable. Jan knows.
對吧 Jan? 告訴大家啊!
Right, Jan? Tell them!
- 你想擦一下嗎?  - 別好心了
- You want to clean up?  - No, don't bother.
這是絲綢的 已經糟蹋了
It is silk. It's fucked.
Mavis 心肝寶貝
Mavis, sweetheart.
媽媽 我在講我過去的事情呢
Mother, I'm trying to tell a story here.
沒錯 我20歲的時候就懷上Buddy的孩子了
Yeah, Buddy got me pregnant at 20.
我們本打算生下來的!
And we were gonna keep it!
我們本可以有個小寶寶的
We were gonna have a little baby,
開個取名小派對
and a little naming party,
買個開心水族館 所有類似的事情
and a Fun aquarium, and all of that.
但12個禮拜之後...
And then 12 weeks into it...
我不小心流產了
Well, I had Buddy's miscarriage.
我希望大家都不要遇到這種情況
Which I wouldn't wish for anyone.
要是事情能稍微如意一點的話
Maybe if things were just a little bit more hospitable
要是我身子能爭氣一點的話
down south in my broken body,
Buddy和我現在就是一個小伙子的爸媽了
Buddy and I would be here right now with a teenager,
甚至更多孩子的爸媽
and probably even more kids,
因為我們心總是在對方身上 一直就是!
because we always found each other. Always!
沒說錯吧 Jan? 告訴他們啊!
Right, Jan? Tell them!
見什麼鬼了?
What the fuck?
乳頭混淆(樂隊名)
這是送Beth的新架子鼓
It's a new drum set for Beth.
怎麼了?
What's wrong?
- 沒事  - 沒... 什麼叫做 沒事?
- Nothing.  - No... what do you mean, nothing?
我的天啊! 你有毛病吧?
My God! What is wrong with you?
你要像個小孩子一樣
Are you like one of those little kids
要他媽的畫板才學的會表達情緒嗎?
who need a fucking chart to learn feelings?
替自己說幾句啊! 你幹嘛遮遮掩掩的?
Stand up for yourself! Why are you covering for me?
鬧夠了 Mavis 你喝醉了
That's enough, Mavis. You're drunk.
哦 我回來之後就一直醉著呢 老媽
Oh, I've been drunk since I've been back, Mom,
要不是這個人讓我火起來 就沒人在乎過
and nobody gave two shits until this one got all bent out of shape.
- Mavis 這到底是怎麼回事?  - 你為什麼要我來啊?
- Mavis, what the hell is going on?  - Why did you invite me?
我不想要你來的 是我老婆的主意
I didn't invite you. My wife did.
Beth幾乎強迫我打給你的 她為你感到難過
Beth practically forced me to call you. She feels sorry for you.
我倆都這麼覺得 Mavis
We all do, Mavis.
你明顯就有些心理上的問題
It's obvious you're having some mental sickness,
有點抑鬱
some depression.
你一個人很孤單 很混亂
You're very lonely and confused.
所以Beth讓我叫你來 就算我早知道這就是個錯誤
So Beth made me invite you here, even though I knew it was a mistake.
我就知道
I knew it.
你撒謊
You're lying.
他沒撒謊
He's not.
現在要怎麼辦呢?
Well. What about now?
你現在恨我嗎?
You hate me now?
這應該不難吧 因為我他媽的太恨你了
'Cause it should be easy, 'cause I fucking hate you.
看看你們 你們都搞什麼啊?
Look at you. What is wrong with you people?
Mavis 親愛的
Mavis, honey.
你要知道 我回來是為了你 為了你!
You know, I came back for you. For you!
我恨死這個鎮子!
And I hate this town!
這就是鄉下土地方 靠著湖邊 聞起來還都是魚腥味!
It's a hick, lake town that smells of fish shit!
但我回來了
But I came back.
我就想讓你知道這些
I just wanted you to know that.
我搞砸了
I screwed up.
- 我徹底搞砸了  - 你都去哪裡了?
- I screwed up so bad.  - Where have you been?
你嚇到我了
You're scaring me.
我瘋了
I'm crazy.
沒人喜歡我
And no one loves me.
你也不愛我
You don't love me.
像我這種人...
Guys like me...
生來就喜歡你這樣的女人的
are born loving women like you.
我今早去了Buddy家裡
I went to Buddy's house.
發生什麼了嗎?
What happened?
我弄髒了我的衣服
I ruined my dress.
我給你...
I'll get you...
我給你拿件衣服
I'll get you a shirt.
不要 我要你裝的這件
No, I want yours.
你要我穿的衣服?
You want the shirt I'm wearing?
抱緊我
Hide me.
沒事了
It's OK.
為什麼是Buddy?
Why Buddy?
因為他人不錯 是個好人
He's a good man. He's kind.
其他男人就不好了?
Are other men unkind?
他在我最美好的時候認識了我
He knew me when I was at my best.
但你現在已經不是那時了 Mavis
You weren't at your best then, Mavis.
已經不是了
Not then.
你知道嗎 我以前每天都能見到你
You know, I saw you every day.
在你櫃子裡 有面小鏡子
You had this little mirror in your locker,
心形的樣子...
shaped like a heart...
你照著鏡子 幾乎都不曾正眼看過我
and you looked in that mirror more than you ever looked at me,
而我也是最美好的時候
and I was at my best.
早上好啊
Good morning.
嗨
Hi.
要杯咖啡嗎?
Coffee?
好啊
Sure.
你還在寫書嗎?
Do you still write those books?
沒有了
No.
那系列已經終結了 續集被取消了
The series is over. It got cancelled.
我現在正在寫最後一本
I'm actually writing the last one right now.
發生了什麼嗎?
What happens?
我不知道
I don't know.
嘿 你知道那個叫Beth的女人嗎?
Hey, do you know this girl named Beth?
她上學的時候就嫁給了Buddy Slade
She married Buddy Slade from school.
知道啊 我認識Beth
Yeah. I know that Beth.
你覺得她怎麼樣?
What do you think of her?
我... 我...
I... I...
我不太喜歡她
I don't really like her.
我是說 我覺得你比她漂亮多了
I mean, I think that you're way prettier than she is.
你衣服怎麼了?
What happened to your dress?
對不起 我說錯什麼了嗎?
I'm sorry. Did I say something wrong?
見鬼
Shit.
怎麼了? 哪句話惹你不開心了?
What's wrong? What did I say?
我碰到很多問題而已
I have a lot of problems.
你不能買件新衣服嗎?
Can't you get a new dress?
要讓我快樂起來可不容易啊...
It's really difficult for me to be happy...
但對其他人來說
and then for other people,
就好像很簡單的樣子
it just seems so simple.
我知道啊
I know.
他們就這麼長大 就很有... 滿足感
They just grow up, and they're so... fulfilled.
我沒覺得很滿足啊
I don't feel fulfilled.
- 這...  - 老實說
- Well...  - And frankly,
如果你有了這麼多東西 都覺得不滿足的話...
if you don't feel fulfilled with all the stuff that you have...
我要改一下 Sandra
I need to change, Sandra.
- 不用 你不用啊  - 什麼?
- No, you don't.  - What?
你是Mercury鎮上唯一能寫書的
You're the only person in Mercury who could write a book,
或者把裙子穿的這麼漂亮的
or wear a dress like that.
我確定 很多人都可以...
I'm sure there's plenty of other people who could...
這裡所有人都又胖又呆
Everyone here is fat and dumb.
別這麼說
Don't say that.
你真的這麼想的嘛?
I mean, you think so?
每個人都希望能像你一樣
Everyone wishes that they could be like you.
住在大城市裡
You know, living in the big city,
有名氣還長得漂亮
all famous and beautiful and all that.
我其實不太有名氣的
I'm not really famous.
你懂的 就是特別那種意思
Well, you know, special or whatever.
有時候 我上班不太忙的時候
I mean, some days, when I have a slow shift at work,
我就會坐在那裡 想想你
I'll sit and think about you,
住在你漂亮的公寓裡 出去逛街什麼的
living in your cool apartment, going out and stuff.
這看起來很不錯的
It seems really nice.
是啊 但是...
Yeah. But...
這裡很多人擁有的這麼少 卻那麼開心
Most people here seem so happy with so little.
就好像他們都不在乎身邊發生了什麼
It's like they don't even seem to care what happens to them.
那是因為他們身邊發生了什麼都無關緊要
That's because it doesn't matter what happens to them.
他們就沒有存在感
They're nothing.
就和死沒什麼兩樣
Might as well die.
去他的Mercury鎮
Fuck Mercury.
謝謝你
Thank you.
我要的就是這個
I needed that.
你說的沒錯
You're right.
這地方爛透了
This place blows.
我要回Minneapolis去
I need to get back to Minneapolis.
把我也帶上吧
Take me with you.
你說什麼?
Excuse me?
把我也帶上吧
Take me with you.
帶我去Minneapolis
You know, to the Minneapolis.
你在這裡很好啊 Sandra
You're good here, Sandra.
哦
Oh.
Dolce乖乖
Dolce.
我對不起
I'm so sorry.
我的寶貝 過來抱一下
My baby. Come here.
畢業典禮對於Kendal來說 苦樂參半
Graduation turned out to be a bittersweet ceremony for Kendal.
雖然榮幸的選為班級畢業典禮致辭的學生代表
While honored to be the valedictorian of her class,
但空氣中還是瀰漫著明晰的哀傷
there was an unmistakable air of sadness
因為Ryan Ashby的英年早逝
over the sudden death of Ryan Ashby.
誰又能想到 Ryan和他女友揚帆遠航的那天
Who could have imagined when Ryan and his girlfriend set sail that day,
會是大家最後一次見到他們呢?
it would be the last time anyone ever saw them?
乖孩子
Good boy.
可憐的Ryan...
Poor Ryan...
在大海中迷了路
Lost at sea.
這些不需要歸還的
They don't need those back.
你可以黏在剪報簿什麼上面
You can put them in a scrapbook, or whatever.
就提一下 這些甜甜圈只提供給榮譽會員的
Just so you know, those doughnuts are for Honors Members only.
就在Kendal清空她櫃子的時候
Kendal felt the weight of her high school years lifting off of her
感覺到了高中的壓力漸漸遠去
as she emptied out her locker.
誠然 她還是時常會想起Waverley
Sure, she'd think about Waverley from time to time.
拉拉隊 辯論隊
Cheer squad, the debate team,
下課後溜進樹林喝酒的時光
sneaking into the woods for a drink after class.
但她最美好的時光還在等著她
But her best years were still ahead of her.
Kendal Strickland準備好迎接這個世界了
Kendal Strickland was ready for the world.
是時候展望未來了
It was time to look to the future.
新的一章
A new chapter.
在她踏上前往劍橋的火車時
As she boarded the train for Cambridge,
她最後望了一眼她的小鎮 飛出一個香吻
she took one last look at her small town and blew it a kiss...
