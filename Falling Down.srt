3
00:04:39,395 --> 00:04:42,387
Where do you think you're going?

4
00:04:43,066 --> 00:04:44,397
Going home.

5
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,740
Officer!

6
00:05:32,048 --> 00:05:36,348
The guy walked into the bushes,
maybe to pee, but he never came back.

7
00:05:36,552 --> 00:05:38,110
Do you need help?

8
00:05:38,454 --> 00:05:39,921
Do you own this car?

9
00:05:40,123 --> 00:05:43,024
That's not him.
The guy walked into the bushes.

10
00:05:43,226 --> 00:05:44,716
He said he was going home.

11
00:05:45,128 --> 00:05:46,220
Going home?

12
00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:49,027
Please return to your cars.

13
00:05:49,232 --> 00:05:50,563
What about the car?

14
00:05:50,967 --> 00:05:53,367
I'll call a tow truck to get it.

15
00:05:53,569 --> 00:05:56,129
Shove it out of the way
and get the lane moving!

16
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,832
We're in a dangerous environment.

17
00:05:59,042 --> 00:06:01,567
We got a lot of glass
and steel rushing by.

18
00:06:03,813 --> 00:06:05,075
Wait a minute.

19
00:06:05,982 --> 00:06:09,474
Prendergast, Downtown Robbery.
Let's go.

20
00:06:09,886 --> 00:06:11,786
I'm in linoleum tile.

21
00:06:11,988 --> 00:06:14,684
All right.
You, back in your vehicle.

22
00:06:15,058 --> 00:06:16,992
You push. I'll steer.

23
00:06:19,896 --> 00:06:23,457
We do ceramics too.
Special discount for law officers.

24
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:28,399
I love Cops, the TV show.
Don't you watch it? I never miss it.

25
00:06:28,671 --> 00:06:30,138
You're lucky you caught me.

26
00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:31,328
I am?

27
00:06:31,574 --> 00:06:34,008
T oday's my last day as a cop.

28
00:06:35,178 --> 00:06:36,440
Lucky me.

29
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:40,746
Don't touch it!

30
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:43,646
Don't touch it!
Just get this lane moving.

31
00:06:43,853 --> 00:06:45,787
Okay. Sorry.

32
00:06:47,857 --> 00:06:49,119
Officer!

33
00:07:03,973 --> 00:07:05,702
Oh, my God! The phone!

34
00:07:06,976 --> 00:07:08,466
Come on, baby.

35
00:07:11,881 --> 00:07:13,371
Watch your fingers.

36
00:07:13,983 --> 00:07:15,814
Take Tucker, okay?

37
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,559
Mom?

38
00:07:27,063 --> 00:07:29,896
om, can you help me open this?

39
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:16,778
Can I get some change for the phone?

40
00:08:17,947 --> 00:08:20,211
No change. Have to buy something.

41
00:09:08,164 --> 00:09:10,724
-Eighty-fie sen.
-What?

42
00:09:10,933 --> 00:09:12,127
Eighty-fie sen.

43
00:09:12,835 --> 00:09:15,599
-I don't understand.
-Eighty-fie sen.

44
00:09:16,939 --> 00:09:18,930
Eighty-five cents?

45
00:09:19,775 --> 00:09:21,868
That won't leave enough for a call.

46
00:09:26,349 --> 00:09:29,807
I'll give you 50 cents.
You give me 50 cents change.

47
00:09:30,052 --> 00:09:32,350
-No way.
-Yes, way.

48
00:09:33,356 --> 00:09:35,950
Drink, eighty-fie sen.
You pay or go!

49
00:09:36,292 --> 00:09:40,092
I don't understand the word ""fie.""
There's a ""v"" in ""five.""

50
00:09:40,296 --> 00:09:41,524
Don't got "v's" in China?

51
00:09:41,964 --> 00:09:44,432
-Not Chinese. I'm lKorean.
-Whatever.

52
00:09:44,634 --> 00:09:46,693
You come to my country,
take my money...

53
00:09:46,902 --> 00:09:48,961
...and don't even learn my language?

54
00:09:52,308 --> 00:09:53,536
You're lKorean?

55
00:09:54,477 --> 00:09:59,005
Do you have any idea how much money
my country has given yours?

56
00:09:59,215 --> 00:10:00,375
How much?

57
00:10:02,551 --> 00:10:05,543
I don't know. It's got to be a lot.
You can bet on that.

58
00:10:06,055 --> 00:10:08,182
You go now! No trouble!

59
00:10:10,993 --> 00:10:12,324
I stay.

60
00:10:13,062 --> 00:10:14,689
What do you think of that?

61
00:10:32,682 --> 00:10:33,740
Jesus Christ!

62
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:37,845
What is this?
The last stand on Fiji?

63
00:10:39,922 --> 00:10:41,890
Take the money! Take the money!

64
00:10:42,091 --> 00:10:43,388
Take the money.

65
00:10:43,592 --> 00:10:46,755
Take your hands away from your--
I can't under-- Stop it!

66
00:10:48,197 --> 00:10:51,598
All right.
Speak slowly and distinctly.

67
00:10:51,867 --> 00:10:53,198
Take the money.

68
00:10:58,607 --> 00:11:01,269
You think I'm a thief?

69
00:11:03,446 --> 00:11:06,040
You see, I'm not the thief.

70
00:11:06,282 --> 00:11:10,616
I'm not charging 85 cents for
a stinking soda! You're the thief!

71
00:11:14,557 --> 00:11:17,890
I'm just standing up
for my rights as a consumer.

72
00:11:20,563 --> 00:11:24,055
I'm rolling back prices to 1 965.
What do you think of that?

73
00:11:27,903 --> 00:11:30,770
Doughnuts. Package of six.
How much?

74
00:11:31,307 --> 00:11:32,296
$ 1. 1 2.

75
00:11:35,311 --> 00:11:36,642
Too much.

76
00:11:39,915 --> 00:11:41,746
Aspirin. Price?

77
00:11:42,151 --> 00:11:43,140
$3.40.

78
00:11:43,652 --> 00:11:44,983
Oh, please!

79
00:11:51,093 --> 00:11:53,425
AA batteries. Package of four.

80
00:11:55,831 --> 00:11:57,594
$4.29.

81
00:11:59,201 --> 00:12:00,498
Nice try.

82
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:04,433
I think this whole shelf looks suspect.

83
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:17,679
One soda...

84
00:12:18,687 --> 00:12:20,018
... 1 2 ounces.

85
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:23,122
50 sen!

86
00:12:26,195 --> 00:12:27,355
Sold.

87
00:12:45,481 --> 00:12:48,382
It's been a pleasure
frequenting your establishment.

88
00:12:59,328 --> 00:13:00,852
Very funny.

89
00:13:01,063 --> 00:13:03,054
Very, very funny.

90
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:06,562
Genuine Arizona sand, Prendergast.
Get used to it.

91
00:13:06,836 --> 00:13:07,825
I bet.

92
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:10,538
Genuine Santa Monica sand's
more like it.

93
00:13:10,773 --> 00:13:15,073
It's from my cat's litterbox,
but he said you could keep the lumps.

94
00:13:18,347 --> 00:13:19,974
You took my stuff out first?

95
00:13:20,182 --> 00:13:21,945
Heck, no. How fun would that be?

96
00:13:22,151 --> 00:13:26,019
-How am I to get a pen out?
-You don't need one. Use a cat turd.

97
00:13:28,757 --> 00:13:31,920
It's your last day. Be careful.
Remember Forsythe?

98
00:13:33,028 --> 00:13:35,895
Forsythe had five minutes
to retirement.

99
00:13:36,098 --> 00:13:39,829
Not even two minutes. The guy was
on the way to his fucking car.

100
00:13:40,035 --> 00:13:43,334
Mowed down by a runaway impound.
Nasty.

101
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:44,402
Ironic.

102
00:13:44,607 --> 00:13:47,542
-lronic as fuck!
-Anything can happen today.

103
00:13:47,776 --> 00:13:50,267
You know how dangerous a desk can be.

104
00:13:50,546 --> 00:13:52,605
Watch out for paper cuts.

105
00:13:53,883 --> 00:13:55,077
Funny, funny, funny.

106
00:13:55,284 --> 00:13:58,014
Sorry. I tried to dissuade them.

107
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:01,087
Hey, Sandra.
It's obligatory, I guess.

108
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:06,220
Now, what else do they have
up their sleeve?

109
00:14:06,896 --> 00:14:08,056
Nothing.

110
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:14,131
Are we still on for lunch?
You're not going home early?

111
00:14:14,403 --> 00:14:15,734
Why would l?

112
00:14:16,305 --> 00:14:17,772
Last day and all.

113
00:14:17,973 --> 00:14:19,372
I'm not superstitious.

114
00:14:19,575 --> 00:14:20,542
Ready, Sandy?

115
00:14:20,743 --> 00:14:21,869
In a minute.

116
00:14:22,077 --> 00:14:24,443
Leave the poor desk jockey alone,
will you?

117
00:14:24,647 --> 00:14:27,047
Go see if you can remember how to
start the car.

118
00:14:27,249 --> 00:14:30,082
Let's not get our pantyhose
in a bind.

119
00:14:31,153 --> 00:14:32,745
I'll miss you, Prendergast.

120
00:14:33,322 --> 00:14:34,755
You really will?

121
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:35,820
Me too.

122
00:14:37,092 --> 00:14:38,286
Come on, Sand, let's go!

123
00:14:38,527 --> 00:14:39,357
Lunch?

124
00:15:03,786 --> 00:15:05,253
Just a second, baby.

125
00:15:06,055 --> 00:15:08,421
When are we going to make
the strawberry cake?

126
00:15:08,624 --> 00:15:10,854
Soon.
I thought sundown would be good.

127
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,789
Here. Not in the house.

128
00:15:13,696 --> 00:15:17,029
Just a few kids.
I didn't want to do a whole big thing.

129
00:15:54,837 --> 00:15:55,997
Prendergast here.

130
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,240
It's me.

131
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:04,673
I wish you were home.
Couldn't you come home now?

132
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,513
What's wrong?

133
00:16:07,182 --> 00:16:08,308
I don't know.

134
00:16:09,184 --> 00:16:11,516
I just got a little scared and...

135
00:16:13,689 --> 00:16:15,748
...I'd like you to come home.

136
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:18,750
What is it, honey?

137
00:16:21,764 --> 00:16:24,392
I don't know.
I was wrapping some...

138
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,535
...some glasses up and some things...

139
00:16:28,537 --> 00:16:31,370
...and I got really scared.

140
00:16:34,443 --> 00:16:37,378
You're not doing this move
just for me, are you?

141
00:16:37,613 --> 00:16:41,447
I mean, you really want to do it,
don't you?

142
00:16:42,117 --> 00:16:45,450
The important thing is we're together.
That's what counts.

143
00:16:46,288 --> 00:16:48,051
But you're not here.

144
00:16:48,457 --> 00:16:50,448
I will be soon, baby.

145
00:16:54,963 --> 00:16:56,294
Say it.

146
00:16:58,567 --> 00:17:00,899
-Say it!
-I'll be home soon!

147
00:17:01,136 --> 00:17:02,967
No, say it!

148
00:17:03,472 --> 00:17:06,805
I'll be home soon, and I love you.

149
00:17:09,978 --> 00:17:11,639
I love you too.

150
00:17:13,248 --> 00:17:14,237
Feel better?

151
00:17:14,717 --> 00:17:16,480
No, I don't feel better!

152
00:17:19,655 --> 00:17:21,919
London Bridge is falling down

153
00:17:22,491 --> 00:17:24,459
Falling down, falling down

154
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,924
London bridge is falling down
Help me.

155
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:30,424
My fair lady

156
00:17:31,934 --> 00:17:33,424
Are you my fair lady?

157
00:17:35,504 --> 00:17:37,768
My fair lady

158
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:40,566
Okay.

159
00:17:42,044 --> 00:17:44,512
-Bye
-Bye-bye.

160
00:18:33,829 --> 00:18:35,558
What you doing, mister?

161
00:18:36,665 --> 00:18:37,723
Nothing.

162
00:18:38,233 --> 00:18:40,861
You' re trespassing
on private property.

163
00:18:41,069 --> 00:18:42,866
-T respassing?
-Loitering too.

164
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:45,164
That's right. You' re loitering too.

165
00:18:45,407 --> 00:18:47,568
I didn't see any signs.

166
00:18:48,243 --> 00:18:49,835
What do you call that?

167
00:18:51,513 --> 00:18:52,741
Graffiti?

168
00:18:54,016 --> 00:18:54,846
No, man.

169
00:18:55,584 --> 00:18:58,246
That's not fucking graffiti!
That's a sign.

170
00:18:59,021 --> 00:19:00,852
He can't read it, man.

171
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:04,853
I'll read it for you.
It says this is private property.

172
00:19:05,694 --> 00:19:07,855
No fucking trespassing!

173
00:19:08,096 --> 00:19:10,087
This means fucking you!

174
00:19:11,767 --> 00:19:13,428
It says all that?

175
00:19:15,037 --> 00:19:17,870
If it was in fucking English,
I'd fucking understand it!

176
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,806
-Thinks he's being funny.
-I'm not laughing.

177
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:23,041
-Me neither.
-Hold it, fellas.

178
00:19:23,946 --> 00:19:26,608
We're getting off on the wrong foot.

179
00:19:29,718 --> 00:19:32,380
This is a gangland thing, isn't it?

180
00:19:32,955 --> 00:19:36,118
We're having a territorial dispute?

181
00:19:37,392 --> 00:19:41,761
I've wandered into your pissing ground
or whatever the damn thing is...

182
00:19:41,964 --> 00:19:45,400
...and you're offended by my presence.
I can understand that.

183
00:19:45,634 --> 00:19:48,967
I mean, I wouldn't want you people
in my back yard, either.

184
00:19:49,304 --> 00:19:51,033
This is your home, and...

185
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,902
...your home is your home
I respect that.

186
00:19:54,309 --> 00:19:58,302
So if you would just back up
a step or two...

187
00:19:58,647 --> 00:20:00,979
...I'll take my problems elsewhere.

188
00:20:01,183 --> 00:20:02,241
Okay?

189
00:20:02,918 --> 00:20:03,782
Fair enough?

190
00:20:03,986 --> 00:20:06,250
-What do you think?
-He should pay a toll.

191
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:07,649
Good idea.

192
00:20:08,423 --> 00:20:10,084
You should pay a toll.

193
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:12,649
Listen, fellas...

194
00:20:12,995 --> 00:20:16,055
...I've had a rare morning.
I'm not in the mood to--

195
00:20:16,265 --> 00:20:17,459
What should he pay?

196
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,827
How about that fucking briefcase?

197
00:20:20,269 --> 00:20:21,668
Good idea.

198
00:20:22,104 --> 00:20:24,095
Give us your briefcase, man.

199
00:20:27,509 --> 00:20:29,977
I'm not giving you
my goddamn briefcase.

200
00:20:30,178 --> 00:20:33,375
Motherfucker, give us
your motherfucking briefcase!

201
00:20:42,024 --> 00:20:44,686
I was willing
to mind my own business.

202
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,522
I was willing to respect your territory
and treat you like a man.

203
00:20:50,132 --> 00:20:51,497
You couldn't let a man...

204
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:56,501
...sit here for five minutes to rest
on your precious piece-of-shit hill?

205
00:20:59,308 --> 00:21:02,505
Want my briefcase?
I'll get it for you, all right?

206
00:21:02,711 --> 00:21:05,305
You want my briefcase?
Here's my briefcase!

207
00:21:13,055 --> 00:21:14,852
Where are you going?

208
00:21:15,057 --> 00:21:17,719
You forgot the briefcase!

209
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:27,427
I'm going home!
Clear the path, you motherfucker!

210
00:21:29,071 --> 00:21:30,231
Clear the path!

211
00:21:30,572 --> 00:21:31,800
I'm going home!

212
00:21:52,861 --> 00:21:54,351
How'd they do that?

213
00:21:58,467 --> 00:21:59,593
-Gun!
-What?

214
00:22:00,035 --> 00:22:03,198
You're leaving today, right?
I got to get your gun.

215
00:22:04,439 --> 00:22:05,531
Right.

216
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:10,269
I need your John Doe
right here, here and here.

217
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:22,253
You got time to take a statement?

218
00:22:22,457 --> 00:22:25,255
I know you want to get home
before you get killed, but--

219
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,223
Yeah, Brian, I'm still working.

220
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:29,260
This guy's a little excited.

221
00:22:29,464 --> 00:22:30,829
Mr. Lee, come on in.

222
00:22:35,237 --> 00:22:36,795
What'd he say?

223
00:22:37,139 --> 00:22:40,040
You know, I don't know.
Mr. Lee is lKorean.

224
00:22:40,242 --> 00:22:43,302
I'm Japanese, in case
you never bothered to notice.

225
00:22:44,146 --> 00:22:46,137
Speak English, okay?

226
00:22:46,748 --> 00:22:48,079
Sit down.

227
00:22:48,984 --> 00:22:53,444
He'll help you. Mr. Lee owns a market.
He was hit less than an hour ago.

228
00:22:53,655 --> 00:22:55,987
Sorry, Mr. Lee, no smoking.

229
00:22:57,426 --> 00:23:00,759
Mr. Lee, let's just start off
with what he looked like.

230
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:05,562
White man, white shirt, tie.

231
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:08,133
-What color was his tie?
-Color?

232
00:23:10,739 --> 00:23:13,606
I don't know color.
The guy attack me, okay?

233
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:16,471
He bust up my store.
I'm lucky to be alive.

234
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:20,243
Just try and relax.
What did he steal from you?

235
00:23:20,449 --> 00:23:22,679
Did not steal! Attack me, okay?

236
00:23:22,884 --> 00:23:25,785
Say he fix my prices.
Bust up my merchandise.

237
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:26,954
He didn't rob you?

238
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:30,283
The guy crazy. I told him,
"T ake my money."

239
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:35,088
He say no. He call me ""thief,""
then he break up my merchandise.

240
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,161
Then he buy a soda and take off.

241
00:23:37,766 --> 00:23:39,961
He bought a soda. He paid for it?

242
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:42,261
I told you, the guy crazy.

243
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,764
Sorry, I thought this
was a robbery.

244
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:48,065
Mr. Lee,
we have to go talk to somebody else.

245
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:51,502
You were assaulted.
This man works robberies.

246
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,680
That's right. Come on.

247
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:58,482
-Baseball bat!
-What's that?

248
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,245
The guy take my baseball bat.

249
00:24:00,455 --> 00:24:01,922
You sell baseball bats?

250
00:24:02,124 --> 00:24:05,321
No, keep for defense.
Under counter. Defense.

251
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:08,826
You mean he stole your baseball bat
but paid for the soda?

252
00:24:09,331 --> 00:24:10,662
This guy's discriminating.

253
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:13,357
That still doesn't count.
Let's go. Thanks.

254
00:24:16,638 --> 00:24:19,607
You should go to the hospital.
Your arm might be broken.

255
00:24:19,808 --> 00:24:22,606
We'll look for this guy,
so shut the fuck up!

256
00:24:22,811 --> 00:24:26,338
What did this guy do?
Threaten you with his credit card?

257
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,175
I told you he had a bat!

258
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:31,614
If this guy's still around,
we'll find him and fuck him up.

259
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,344
Then you go to the hospital?

260
00:24:33,588 --> 00:24:34,885
Shut up!

261
00:24:50,939 --> 00:24:52,907
Cut the crap.
I know it's you.

262
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:54,564
What do you want?

263
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:59,206
It is you, isn't it?

264
00:25:01,716 --> 00:25:03,149
It's me.

265
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:10,214
You got to stop calling me.

266
00:25:11,326 --> 00:25:13,317
It's Adele's birthday....

267
00:25:14,329 --> 00:25:16,820
Yes, I know.
What do you want?

268
00:25:20,168 --> 00:25:21,567
I'm coming home.

269
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:23,833
What are you talking about?

270
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:27,040
I just....

271
00:25:28,343 --> 00:25:31,835
I want you to know that
I'm coming home for her birthday.

272
00:25:32,914 --> 00:25:34,404
No, you're not coming here.

273
00:25:36,685 --> 00:25:38,084
Listen, Beth...

274
00:25:41,256 --> 00:25:42,746
...I got to see you.

275
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:49,318
No, you listen to me.
This is my house now. I pay the rent.

276
00:25:49,531 --> 00:25:51,396
You don't even pay child support.

277
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,329
You can't just walkk in and out.

278
00:25:53,535 --> 00:25:55,526
Don't talk like that, Beth.

279
00:25:57,706 --> 00:25:59,697
I have to come home.

280
00:26:00,709 --> 00:26:02,438
I have to bring her a present.

281
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,941
You know you can't come here!

282
00:26:19,227 --> 00:26:21,388
It's him! It's him, man!

283
00:26:24,266 --> 00:26:25,130
How's Adele?

284
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:28,829
This isn't your home anymore.

285
00:26:33,575 --> 00:26:34,564
How is she?

286
00:26:36,878 --> 00:26:38,812
She's doing just fine
without you.

287
00:26:41,249 --> 00:26:43,046
-Get out.
-Come on, man.

288
00:26:43,251 --> 00:26:46,778
It's fucking broad daylight!
This shit ain't worth it!

289
00:26:46,988 --> 00:26:49,513
-Get the fuck out!
-Get out of the car!

290
00:26:49,724 --> 00:26:51,385
Give me one, give me one.

291
00:26:52,627 --> 00:26:53,457
And you?

292
00:26:54,596 --> 00:26:55,426
Don't.

293
00:26:57,666 --> 00:26:59,395
I'll call the police
if I have to.

294
00:26:59,601 --> 00:27:01,000
Go, go, go!

295
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:03,430
I'm coming home.

296
00:27:07,008 --> 00:27:07,906
I'm coming home.

297
00:27:22,457 --> 00:27:24,186
Did you get him?

298
00:28:25,019 --> 00:28:26,509
You missed.

299
00:28:41,035 --> 00:28:42,593
I missed too.

300
00:28:56,251 --> 00:28:58,116
Don't fucking do it, man!

301
00:28:59,621 --> 00:29:01,020
No, man.

302
00:29:01,222 --> 00:29:02,712
Fuck you, motherfucker!

303
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:07,291
There, you see?

304
00:29:09,531 --> 00:29:11,260
That's the concept.

305
00:29:19,607 --> 00:29:22,201
Take some shooting lessons, asshole!

306
00:29:44,966 --> 00:29:46,297
She's open.

307
00:29:54,476 --> 00:29:55,807
Have a seat.

308
00:29:56,811 --> 00:29:57,903
Captain.

309
00:30:03,918 --> 00:30:05,215
Did you hear?

310
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:07,320
The drive-by shooting?

311
00:30:07,755 --> 00:30:09,586
Disgusting!

312
00:30:10,158 --> 00:30:12,649
You know who'll have to take
the heat again...

313
00:30:12,861 --> 00:30:14,988
...when the shit hits the fan.

314
00:30:21,436 --> 00:30:23,495
You're retiring a little early.

315
00:30:24,339 --> 00:30:26,500
You won't be getting
your full pension.

316
00:30:27,175 --> 00:30:29,609
Yes, sir, that's right.
I won't.

317
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:35,374
This isn't because
you were wounded, is it?

318
00:30:38,353 --> 00:30:39,445
Wounded?

319
00:30:40,021 --> 00:30:41,352
Because, I mean...

320
00:30:42,524 --> 00:30:44,492
...you're behind a desk now.

321
00:30:44,692 --> 00:30:46,819
Not much chance
of getting wounded there.

322
00:30:47,462 --> 00:30:50,363
Look, captain, it has nothing
to do with that.

323
00:30:55,136 --> 00:30:57,036
I'll make my speech.

324
00:30:57,539 --> 00:31:00,064
They make me do this,
you understand.

325
00:31:01,142 --> 00:31:03,133
I hate to lose a good cop.

326
00:31:04,312 --> 00:31:06,712
Not too late to change your mind.

327
00:31:07,815 --> 00:31:10,875
Lot of good cops want to drop
the whole kit and caboodle.

328
00:31:11,085 --> 00:31:12,609
And who wouldn't?

329
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,082
The pay stinks...

330
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:18,020
...and you're up to your ears
in human scum 1 6 hours a day.

331
00:31:19,661 --> 00:31:22,323
But it gets in your blood.

332
00:31:23,731 --> 00:31:25,892
A lot of good cops'll
get to the point...

333
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:29,092
...of slapping their badge
down on this desk...

334
00:31:29,571 --> 00:31:32,836
...and find they just can't do it.
How about you?

335
00:31:33,074 --> 00:31:34,837
Will you stick with the team?

336
00:31:38,012 --> 00:31:40,742
No, captain.
I don't think I will.

337
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:49,018
Like I say, they make me ask.
You understand.

338
00:31:50,258 --> 00:31:51,623
How are the kids?

339
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,418
I don't have any.

340
00:31:55,697 --> 00:31:57,096
What the hell?

341
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,067
I'd like to take my stick
to some of these clerks.

342
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:05,865
-The file says--
-We lost a child.

343
00:32:07,275 --> 00:32:08,105
Lost it?

344
00:32:08,376 --> 00:32:09,934
Her. Lost her.

345
00:32:10,211 --> 00:32:12,771
Yes, of course. Her.
That's rough.

346
00:32:13,448 --> 00:32:15,177
Well, it can be.

347
00:32:15,383 --> 00:32:16,543
Yes, sir.

348
00:32:21,956 --> 00:32:23,287
Still married, right?

349
00:32:24,392 --> 00:32:25,950
Yes, sir, I am.

350
00:32:33,668 --> 00:32:34,999
That's good.

351
00:33:44,472 --> 00:33:45,803
Where you going?

352
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,167
-I'm going home.
-Not this way.

353
00:33:48,376 --> 00:33:51,709
-Why not?
-Metrorail construction, that's why not.

354
00:33:52,313 --> 00:33:53,473
Go around.

355
00:33:54,549 --> 00:33:55,914
Just follow your tootsies.

356
00:33:56,884 --> 00:34:01,184
You sure you don't want something?
Coffee, soda, something?

357
00:34:01,389 --> 00:34:02,720
No, thank you.

358
00:34:04,325 --> 00:34:06,350
I feel kind of stupid about this.

359
00:34:06,561 --> 00:34:08,529
Better safe than sorry.

360
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:10,391
That's what I thought.

361
00:34:10,732 --> 00:34:13,360
You have a restraining order
against your husband?

362
00:34:13,568 --> 00:34:14,865
Ex-husband.

363
00:34:15,737 --> 00:34:17,671
He'd show up on the wrong day...

364
00:34:17,905 --> 00:34:21,170
...or in the middle of the night,
pounding on the door.

365
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:24,544
He has this horrendous temper.

366
00:34:24,746 --> 00:34:27,977
I didn't know if
a restraining order was a good idea...

367
00:34:28,182 --> 00:34:30,207
...if it'd do more harm than good.

368
00:34:30,418 --> 00:34:34,184
But the judge said
we should make an example of him.

369
00:34:35,256 --> 00:34:38,589
So he can't come within
1 00 feet of us.

370
00:34:39,093 --> 00:34:41,994
Or is it yards?
Which is it? Feet or yards?

371
00:34:42,196 --> 00:34:43,891
That's up to the judge.

372
00:34:44,098 --> 00:34:47,067
-I thought it was a set thing.
-It's at his discretion.

373
00:34:47,268 --> 00:34:48,394
That's interesting.

374
00:34:48,603 --> 00:34:49,627
Does he drink?

375
00:34:52,106 --> 00:34:54,472
Oh, I thought you meant the judge!

376
00:34:55,276 --> 00:34:57,540
-No, I wouldn't say so.
-Do drugs?

377
00:35:00,381 --> 00:35:02,315
But he is prone to violence?

378
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:05,275
Yeah, I think you could say that.

379
00:35:06,554 --> 00:35:08,613
Did he strike the little girl?

380
00:35:10,892 --> 00:35:12,450
Did he strike you?

381
00:35:13,561 --> 00:35:15,085
Not exactly.

382
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:17,788
Not exactly?

383
00:35:20,735 --> 00:35:23,465
There were times when l...

384
00:35:23,805 --> 00:35:25,864
...thought he was going to...

385
00:35:26,073 --> 00:35:29,565
...but I just didn't want to wait
until he got around to it.

386
00:35:34,649 --> 00:35:36,310
It's hard to explain.

387
00:35:39,487 --> 00:35:41,352
He could, I think.

388
00:35:41,923 --> 00:35:42,855
You think?

389
00:36:50,491 --> 00:36:52,186
Hello, sir.
How are you today?

390
00:36:52,393 --> 00:36:53,690
I'm doing all right.

391
00:36:53,895 --> 00:36:55,954
-How about you?
-Me? I'm terrible.

392
00:36:56,163 --> 00:36:57,187
I'm sorry.

393
00:36:57,398 --> 00:37:00,731
I came from Santa Barbara,
and my friend wasn't home...

394
00:37:00,935 --> 00:37:02,300
...and he owes me money...

395
00:37:02,503 --> 00:37:04,869
...so I have no money to go home.

396
00:37:05,072 --> 00:37:07,870
I'm almost out of gas.
I had to sleep in my car.

397
00:37:08,075 --> 00:37:11,203
Do you have a few bucks?
It would really help me out.

398
00:37:11,412 --> 00:37:13,846
I'll mail it back.
Honest.

399
00:37:14,849 --> 00:37:16,316
Let me see your license.

400
00:37:16,517 --> 00:37:17,711
What for?

401
00:37:17,919 --> 00:37:19,853
It'll have your address on it.

402
00:37:20,087 --> 00:37:23,318
-I don't have a license.
-You drove all the way without it?

403
00:37:23,524 --> 00:37:24,718
Are you a cop?

404
00:37:24,926 --> 00:37:27,451
Let's see your car registration
and your car.

405
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:31,098
All right, forget it.
Okay, just forget it.

406
00:37:32,633 --> 00:37:35,101
That's a hell of a way
to treat a vet, man.

407
00:37:36,203 --> 00:37:40,606
-You're an animal doctor?
-No, a veteran. I was in Nam.

408
00:37:41,042 --> 00:37:43,237
You must've been 1 0 years old.

409
00:37:43,444 --> 00:37:45,844
I meant to say the Gulf.

410
00:37:46,047 --> 00:37:49,210
Come on! All I'm asking for
is a little change.

411
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:52,044
I haven't eaten in three days.

412
00:37:52,386 --> 00:37:54,616
Except for this.

413
00:37:55,056 --> 00:37:58,890
Fuck it! Give me some money, man.
Just give me some money.

414
00:37:59,627 --> 00:38:02,187
How about a dime?
Give it to me.

415
00:38:02,396 --> 00:38:03,590
I'm not giving you any.

416
00:38:03,798 --> 00:38:05,595
-You got a cigarette?
-No.

417
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,267
You got to give me something.

418
00:38:07,468 --> 00:38:09,095
Why don't you try to get a job?

419
00:38:09,303 --> 00:38:11,771
This is my park.
I live here.

420
00:38:11,973 --> 00:38:15,272
Who are you, walking
through my park with two bags?

421
00:38:15,476 --> 00:38:17,876
I don't got any. Is that fair?

422
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:20,843
What's in those bags, anyway?
Give me one.

423
00:38:21,082 --> 00:38:24,449
I could sell those bags
and eat for a week with the money.

424
00:38:24,652 --> 00:38:27,450
Come on, you've got two of them.
Why do you need two?

425
00:38:28,155 --> 00:38:29,417
You're right.

426
00:38:30,091 --> 00:38:31,115
Here.

427
00:38:31,425 --> 00:38:33,859
-Are you serious?
-I don't need it anymore.

428
00:38:36,297 --> 00:38:40,393
All right! Come on, now. Come on!
What the--

429
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:46,835
Son of a bitch!

430
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:57,315
-Can we cut the crap this time?
-I'm telling you the truth!

431
00:38:57,518 --> 00:38:58,746
Yeah, right.

432
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:06,191
-What's up?
-She was at the drive-by shooting.

433
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:09,157
-Who hit your guys?
-I told you.

434
00:39:09,363 --> 00:39:12,662
We know. The big bad white man.
We're not buying it.

435
00:39:12,867 --> 00:39:14,767
Who are you protecting?

436
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:19,004
They put your boyfriend in the hospital.
He's probably dead.

437
00:39:19,206 --> 00:39:21,834
Do you realize that?
He's probably fucking dead!

438
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:23,007
Stop saying that!

439
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:25,201
You picked a good day to leave.

440
00:39:25,713 --> 00:39:28,739
You want another 3-year-old
to get shot in the head?

441
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:30,382
Is that what you want?

442
00:39:35,056 --> 00:39:36,250
T ell me the truth!

443
00:39:37,058 --> 00:39:39,049
I' m telling you the truth!

444
00:39:40,394 --> 00:39:41,520
It was a white guy!

445
00:39:41,729 --> 00:39:45,187
-Why would he go after your friends?
-I don't know!

446
00:39:45,399 --> 00:39:49,199
He attacked them on Angel's Flight Hill
with a baseball bat!

447
00:39:49,403 --> 00:39:51,303
A baseball bat?
Wait!

448
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:55,407
Baseball bat.
What did this guy look like?

449
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:58,543
I don't know.
He looked like you, except...

450
00:39:58,746 --> 00:40:00,577
...he was taller and had hair.

451
00:40:00,915 --> 00:40:02,712
Good description, Angie.

452
00:40:02,917 --> 00:40:04,714
Did he wear
a white shirt and tie?

453
00:40:08,122 --> 00:40:09,521
Come over here, will you?

454
00:40:10,558 --> 00:40:13,527
We got to keep the pressure on her.
Don't interrupt.

455
00:40:13,727 --> 00:40:15,251
What about the baseball bat?

456
00:40:15,463 --> 00:40:18,523
-The white shirt and tie!
-What will she think of next?

457
00:40:18,732 --> 00:40:20,757
I' m sorry you' re leaving,
but you are.

458
00:40:20,968 --> 00:40:24,734
-Listen to me. Listen to me!
-Check me later, babe.

459
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,914
Remember the Korean storekeeper?

460
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:36,373
Come here.

461
00:40:36,584 --> 00:40:38,415
Where was this place?

462
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:40,718
Right there.

463
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:43,285
And he was assaulted
sometime after 8 a.m.?

464
00:40:43,491 --> 00:40:47,120
-About that.
-And the drive-by was here, right?

465
00:40:47,328 --> 00:40:48,454
What's going on?

466
00:40:48,662 --> 00:40:53,122
I may be nuts, but Angel's Flight Hill
is between those two spots.

467
00:40:53,334 --> 00:40:56,735
-lt was a classy neighborhood.
-It's a shit hole. Gangland.

468
00:40:56,937 --> 00:41:01,237
I know. What would a white guy
in a shirt and tie be doing in...

469
00:41:01,442 --> 00:41:02,841
...gangland?

470
00:41:17,791 --> 00:41:19,190
Can I help you?

471
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:23,590
I'd like a ham and cheese
Whamlette, an order of Wham fries--

472
00:41:23,831 --> 00:41:27,130
Sorry, we stopped serving breakfast.
We're on the lunch menu.

473
00:41:27,968 --> 00:41:29,094
But I want breakfast.

474
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:31,133
We' re not serving it.

475
00:41:31,972 --> 00:41:33,633
So you said.

476
00:41:34,875 --> 00:41:36,172
Is that the manager?

477
00:41:37,778 --> 00:41:39,439
Could I speak to him, please?

478
00:41:40,648 --> 00:41:41,740
Sure.

479
00:41:41,949 --> 00:41:44,509
Rick, a customer would like
to speak to you.

480
00:41:47,121 --> 00:41:47,951
Yes, sir?

481
00:41:48,155 --> 00:41:49,816
I'd like some breakfast.

482
00:41:50,391 --> 00:41:52,586
We stopped serving breakfast.

483
00:41:52,793 --> 00:41:57,457
I know you stopped breakfast, Rick.
Sheila told me you stopped....

484
00:41:58,332 --> 00:42:01,267
Why am I calling you by first names?
I don't know you.

485
00:42:01,468 --> 00:42:06,098
I call my boss " mister" after seven years,
but I walk in here, a total stranger...

486
00:42:06,307 --> 00:42:10,107
...and I call you Rick and Sheila
like we're in some kind of AA meeting.

487
00:42:11,478 --> 00:42:15,437
I don't want to be your buddy.
I just want a little breakfast.

488
00:42:15,649 --> 00:42:18,277
You can call me Miss Folsom
if you want to.

489
00:42:18,485 --> 00:42:21,420
We stopped serving breakfast
at 1 1 :30.

490
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:32,623
Rick...

491
00:42:32,833 --> 00:42:37,167
...have you ever heard the expression,
"The customer is always right"?

492
00:42:39,673 --> 00:42:41,004
Well...

493
00:42:41,442 --> 00:42:42,409
...here I am.

494
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:44,509
The customer.

495
00:42:45,446 --> 00:42:47,004
That's not our policy.

496
00:42:47,214 --> 00:42:49,978
You have to order something
from the lunch menu.

497
00:42:51,785 --> 00:42:53,980
I don't want lunch.

498
00:42:54,188 --> 00:42:55,587
I want breakfast.

499
00:42:55,956 --> 00:42:58,424
Yeah, well, hey,
I'm really sorry.

500
00:42:58,692 --> 00:43:01,058
Yeah, well, hey,
I'm really sorry too!

501
00:43:01,262 --> 00:43:02,695
He's got a gun!

502
00:43:03,197 --> 00:43:04,824
Let's get organized!

503
00:43:05,432 --> 00:43:06,558
Calm down!

504
00:43:06,767 --> 00:43:09,736
Just calm down, everybody.
Sit down over there!

505
00:43:10,871 --> 00:43:11,895
Mister?

506
00:43:13,707 --> 00:43:15,174
Where are you going?

507
00:43:15,409 --> 00:43:18,435
No. You sit down there,
and you finish your lunch.

508
00:43:18,779 --> 00:43:22,613
Everybody just relax
and take it easy.

509
00:43:24,551 --> 00:43:26,542
Why don't you eat your lunch?
Please.

510
00:43:26,754 --> 00:43:28,722
You all need your vitamins A, B and--

511
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:33,190
Don't! It was an accident!

512
00:43:33,394 --> 00:43:36,727
It's the trigger. It's sensitive.
It's okay!

513
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:40,632
It's a sensitive trigger.

514
00:43:46,006 --> 00:43:47,439
Could I have my breakfast?

515
00:43:47,641 --> 00:43:48,733
Yes, sir.
Sheila?

516
00:43:58,285 --> 00:44:00,879
Rick? Miss Folsom?

517
00:44:01,455 --> 00:44:02,786
You know what?

518
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:05,220
You were right.
I've changed my mind.

519
00:44:05,426 --> 00:44:07,417
I'm going to have some lunch.

520
00:44:07,661 --> 00:44:10,994
Could I have a double Whammyburger
with cheese--

521
00:44:11,265 --> 00:44:13,460
-You getting this?
-Yes, sir.

522
00:44:13,767 --> 00:44:17,396
And an order of Whammy fries
and, let's see...

523
00:44:17,604 --> 00:44:19,162
...a Choco-Wham shake.

524
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,938
Yes, sir.
Sheila, get his order.

525
00:44:22,276 --> 00:44:24,335
Rick, could you
get it for me, please?

526
00:44:25,279 --> 00:44:27,611
I feel more comfortable
calling you Rick...

527
00:44:27,815 --> 00:44:30,283
...after all we've
been through together.

528
00:44:35,789 --> 00:44:37,017
How you doing?

529
00:44:38,025 --> 00:44:39,458
Enjoying your meal?

530
00:44:42,129 --> 00:44:43,118
How about you, son?

531
00:44:43,364 --> 00:44:44,854
Is it good?

532
00:44:48,702 --> 00:44:50,795
And you, ma'am?
How's the food?

533
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,032
I think we have a critic.

534
00:44:57,511 --> 00:44:59,979
I don't think she likes
the special sauce.

535
00:45:02,182 --> 00:45:03,479
That's a joke.

536
00:45:04,718 --> 00:45:06,049
Now, here we go.

537
00:45:06,854 --> 00:45:07,878
Thank you.

538
00:45:11,825 --> 00:45:13,816
See, this is what I'm talking about.

539
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:15,659
Look at that.

540
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:19,666
See what I mean? It's plump, juicy
and three inches thick.

541
00:45:23,537 --> 00:45:27,496
Now look at this sorry,
miserable, squashed thing.

542
00:45:28,275 --> 00:45:31,267
Can anybody tell me
what's wrong with this picture?

543
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:33,673
Anybody?

544
00:45:35,182 --> 00:45:36,740
Anybody at all.

545
00:45:47,961 --> 00:45:49,690
You guys are partners again!

546
00:45:49,897 --> 00:45:53,162
No such luck, Lita.
He's moving to Lake Havasu.

547
00:45:53,434 --> 00:45:56,164
-What's in Lake Havasu?
-London Bridge.

548
00:45:56,370 --> 00:45:59,669
-Are you going to England?
-They moved it to Arizona.

549
00:46:00,073 --> 00:46:03,372
-Stone by stone.
-Oh, yeah. I heard about that.

550
00:46:03,577 --> 00:46:06,444
You' re better off,
because cops get killed.

551
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:09,209
-You usually get six?
-Seven.

552
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:10,940
Two sevens.

553
00:46:16,323 --> 00:46:17,187
You all right?

554
00:46:20,494 --> 00:46:21,358
You sure?

555
00:46:24,264 --> 00:46:25,094
What?

556
00:46:29,570 --> 00:46:31,902
Sorry, I wasn't going to do this.

557
00:46:32,406 --> 00:46:34,931
I should just shut up.
It's none of my business.

558
00:46:35,142 --> 00:46:36,404
Tell me.

559
00:46:37,811 --> 00:46:39,802
Lake Havasu?

560
00:46:40,914 --> 00:46:42,609
It's nice. We like it.

561
00:46:42,816 --> 00:46:44,078
She likes it.

562
00:46:44,485 --> 00:46:46,612
What'll you do, watch the cactus grow?

563
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:48,151
Cacti.

564
00:46:51,425 --> 00:46:53,620
She's not handling
middle age too well.

565
00:46:53,827 --> 00:46:55,226
The change of life...

566
00:46:55,429 --> 00:46:57,659
...and all that, whatever it is.

567
00:46:58,932 --> 00:47:00,229
What about you?

568
00:47:00,434 --> 00:47:03,096
Me? It's different,
because she's a woman.

569
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:05,496
What's different?
I'm a woman.

570
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:07,932
But she was once very beautiful.

571
00:47:09,676 --> 00:47:10,802
Thanks a lot!

572
00:47:11,011 --> 00:47:13,275
You know what I mean.
Come on.

573
00:47:14,014 --> 00:47:16,574
She could have been anything.
Anything but a cop's wife.

574
00:47:16,783 --> 00:47:17,875
She's too high-strung.

575
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:21,782
Don't give me that
homecoming queen bullshit again.

576
00:47:22,689 --> 00:47:24,179
That was a long time ago.

577
00:47:24,858 --> 00:47:27,088
Sandra, you have a career.

578
00:47:27,494 --> 00:47:30,588
It's hard to lose your beauty
when that's all you've got.

579
00:47:30,797 --> 00:47:32,196
What about your career?

580
00:47:33,133 --> 00:47:34,623
I'll be okay...

581
00:47:34,968 --> 00:47:36,959
...even without you.

582
00:47:43,477 --> 00:47:44,774
Sorry to break this up.

583
00:47:44,978 --> 00:47:47,105
-What are you doing here?
-We got a call.

584
00:47:47,314 --> 00:47:48,781
Watch out! Hot plates!

585
00:47:48,982 --> 00:47:51,815
-Don't touch my gun.
-Fuck you!

586
00:47:52,019 --> 00:47:55,352
You'll love this one.
Some dickhead went into Whammyburger...

587
00:47:55,556 --> 00:47:58,650
...pulled out a gun because
they stopped serving breakfast...

588
00:47:58,859 --> 00:48:00,850
...then paid for it and left.

589
00:48:01,061 --> 00:48:02,119
Sorry, Prendergast.

590
00:48:02,329 --> 00:48:03,387
He paid for it?

591
00:48:04,164 --> 00:48:05,688
Move your buns. Let's go.

592
00:48:05,899 --> 00:48:06,957
I gotta go.

593
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:08,464
Where was this?

594
00:48:08,669 --> 00:48:11,331
Quintero and Fourth.
Bye, ladies.

595
00:48:12,339 --> 00:48:14,500
Wait a minute. Wait, wait!

596
00:48:15,175 --> 00:48:18,303
Let me know
what this guy was wearing, okay?

597
00:48:18,512 --> 00:48:22,642
You trying to crack a big one
before you disappear into the desert?

598
00:48:22,849 --> 00:48:26,148
Sandra, find out if he's wearing
a white shirt and tie, okay?

599
00:48:26,353 --> 00:48:27,877
Let's go, lovebirds.

600
00:48:28,088 --> 00:48:29,851
-I got to go.
-Wait.

601
00:48:30,691 --> 00:48:33,592
Something about my wife.
Maybe I never mentioned it.

602
00:48:35,362 --> 00:48:36,420
What?

603
00:48:39,232 --> 00:48:40,529
I love her.

604
00:48:41,902 --> 00:48:43,335
Let's go!

605
00:49:11,264 --> 00:49:13,095
For seven years, I banked here.

606
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:16,133
When I asked them for a loan,
a small loan...

607
00:49:17,137 --> 00:49:21,233
...they told me that
I was not "economically viable."

608
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:32,609
Excuse me. Excuse me, sir?

609
00:49:32,919 --> 00:49:35,888
How'd your loan work out?
Did they give you a loan?

610
00:49:36,590 --> 00:49:38,956
He must be economically viable!

611
00:49:39,159 --> 00:49:42,253
There's a man with a smiling face.
A happy customer.

612
00:49:42,496 --> 00:49:45,829
That's what an economically viable
person looks like!

613
00:49:58,178 --> 00:49:59,770
How much is the...?

614
00:50:00,013 --> 00:50:02,004
That is only three dollars.

615
00:50:06,186 --> 00:50:09,314
I asked them for a small loan.
You know what they told me?

616
00:50:09,523 --> 00:50:12,185
I was not economically viable.

617
00:50:12,392 --> 00:50:14,451
Come on. That's enough.

618
00:50:15,495 --> 00:50:18,362
-I'll buy this.
-That is three dollars.

619
00:50:30,877 --> 00:50:35,143
This is what happens if you're
not economically viable!

620
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:48,356
Don't let this happen to you!

621
00:50:49,396 --> 00:50:50,886
Bye, everybody!

622
00:50:56,269 --> 00:50:57,201
Don't forget me!

623
00:51:17,424 --> 00:51:18,584
I'm sorry.

624
00:51:19,926 --> 00:51:21,188
We're leaving now.

625
00:51:21,695 --> 00:51:22,923
You are? Really?

626
00:51:23,130 --> 00:51:25,894
It doesn't look like
your husband's going to show.

627
00:51:26,099 --> 00:51:31,002
He probably realized he could get
into trouble if he harassed you.

628
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:34,398
I think you should call your lawyer
and tell him about it.

629
00:51:34,741 --> 00:51:38,199
It's one of those services.
I didn't have much money.

630
00:51:38,445 --> 00:51:42,381
Have them call your husband's lawyer,
make it official.

631
00:51:42,783 --> 00:51:47,618
In the meantime, lock up.
And if anything else happens, call us.

632
00:51:47,821 --> 00:51:49,880
-Okay, thanks.
-Sure thing.

633
00:52:04,137 --> 00:52:06,697
Excuse me. Hey, excuse me!

634
00:52:06,907 --> 00:52:10,968
I don't know if you've noticed, but
others are waiting to use the phone.

635
00:52:11,178 --> 00:52:13,703
-Others want to use the phone?
-Right, you asshole!

636
00:52:13,914 --> 00:52:16,644
Jeez, that's too bad.
Because you know what?

637
00:52:22,823 --> 00:52:24,654
I think it's out of order.

638
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:37,130
Hi, it's me.

639
00:52:37,337 --> 00:52:39,805
He's eating and resting
comfortably now.

640
00:52:40,006 --> 00:52:41,234
-Who is?
-Mr. Peepers.

641
00:52:41,441 --> 00:52:42,430
Good!

642
00:52:42,676 --> 00:52:45,577
Honey, I'm sorry about before.
I really blew my top.

643
00:52:45,779 --> 00:52:48,748
That's okay, honey.
Could you hold on just one second?

644
00:52:48,949 --> 00:52:49,916
Prendergast.

645
00:52:50,116 --> 00:52:51,140
White shirt and tie.

646
00:52:51,351 --> 00:52:52,579
Could you hold on?

647
00:52:52,819 --> 00:52:53,911
I got to go.

648
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:57,112
Just one second.
It's very important.

649
00:52:57,691 --> 00:53:00,319
Detective Torres?
Excuse me?

650
00:53:00,527 --> 00:53:03,963
We have about 7 million people
waiting to make a statement.

651
00:53:05,165 --> 00:53:06,655
Let me call you right back.

652
00:53:06,867 --> 00:53:08,596
What's wrong?
What are you doing?

653
00:53:08,802 --> 00:53:11,703
Nothing's wrong.
What do you mean?

654
00:53:12,038 --> 00:53:14,506
-You come home then.
-I can't.

655
00:53:14,708 --> 00:53:17,768
It's your last day.
What are they going to do, fire you?

656
00:53:17,978 --> 00:53:21,436
There's a lot of red tape.
As soon as I get done, I can go home.

657
00:53:21,648 --> 00:53:23,946
I'll call you in a while, okay?

658
00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:26,175
Wait a minute. Make a list.

659
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:27,283
A list?

660
00:53:27,554 --> 00:53:32,184
We need boneless, skkinless chickken,
red bell peppers. Not green, red.

661
00:53:32,392 --> 00:53:34,383
Honey, hold on one second.

662
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:37,396
I am tying up the phone here.

663
00:53:37,597 --> 00:53:39,895
Just listen for once in your life.

664
00:53:40,901 --> 00:53:44,132
A girl at the drive-by said
a man in a white shirt and tie...

665
00:53:44,337 --> 00:53:47,306
...attacked her homeboys
with a baseball bat.

666
00:53:47,507 --> 00:53:49,566
I think somebody let that dog
off the leash.

667
00:53:50,243 --> 00:53:52,074
I think you've got last day-itis.

668
00:53:52,279 --> 00:53:56,909
This man was not swinging a bat.
He has a gym bag full of guns.

669
00:53:57,651 --> 00:53:59,084
A gym bag?

670
00:54:00,086 --> 00:54:02,919
You asked me to tell you what he wore.
Now I got to run.

671
00:54:03,123 --> 00:54:05,250
We have to canvas the neighborhood.

672
00:54:05,458 --> 00:54:06,584
One more second.

673
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:08,259
Please. It's important.

674
00:54:09,562 --> 00:54:11,996
-Why don't you go to the store?
-Why?

675
00:54:12,198 --> 00:54:13,722
It's my last day.

676
00:54:13,934 --> 00:54:16,732
The guys might want to have
a send off or something.

677
00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:19,334
What are they going to do?
Have some broad...

678
00:54:19,539 --> 00:54:22,235
...dance topless on your deskk
or something?

679
00:54:22,442 --> 00:54:24,273
Course not.

680
00:54:24,778 --> 00:54:29,715
Look. While you' re playing cop,
l' m at home planning your retirement.

681
00:54:30,283 --> 00:54:33,878
It's over. The sooner you get that
through your head, the better.

682
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:37,419
You are no longer
in the law-enforcement business.

683
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:41,058
Now, I will expect you
at the usual time. Capito?

684
00:54:42,896 --> 00:54:45,558
Sandra, are you mad at me?

685
00:54:46,299 --> 00:54:49,132
-I hate you, but l' m not mad.
-Are you retiring too?

686
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:56,700
Just don't leave
without saying goodbye.

687
00:54:56,910 --> 00:54:58,241
Goodbye.

688
00:54:58,745 --> 00:55:01,145
If you go up against this guy...

689
00:55:01,915 --> 00:55:02,745
...be careful.

690
00:56:28,034 --> 00:56:29,296
I'm Nick.

691
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:32,499
What can I do you for?

692
00:56:32,705 --> 00:56:34,866
I'm just looking for
some hiking boots.

693
00:56:35,208 --> 00:56:37,802
Well, well, hiking boots.

694
00:56:38,044 --> 00:56:40,205
Let's see what we got.

695
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:42,443
These are the top of the line...

696
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:45,482
...scientifically engineered
and all that crap.

697
00:56:45,718 --> 00:56:49,279
Guaranteed by some Sierra Club asshole
not to hurt a chipmunk...

698
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:51,320
...if you step on it.

699
00:56:51,591 --> 00:56:55,425
Personally, I think they're
for pussies and faggots!

700
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:57,152
Now these...

701
00:56:57,597 --> 00:56:59,428
...are Vietnam jungle boots.

702
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:03,467
Cost half as much,
last twice as long and are great...

703
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:05,695
...for stomping queers!

704
00:57:05,905 --> 00:57:09,966
When you're done, you got to clean
out the waffle with a stick, but...

705
00:57:10,176 --> 00:57:12,736
...you can't have everything, right?

706
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:14,806
Forget it.

707
00:57:16,282 --> 00:57:17,613
Come on, let's go.

708
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:20,285
Have a nice day, fellas!

709
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:23,011
Y'all come back now, you hear?

710
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:25,180
You got a problem, buddy?

711
00:57:29,996 --> 00:57:31,258
You got the problem!

712
00:57:31,464 --> 00:57:33,762
-No, you do, buddy!
-Read the sign!

713
00:57:33,967 --> 00:57:35,958
"l reserve the right."

714
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:38,136
Now take a hike.

715
00:57:38,471 --> 00:57:39,631
Make me.

716
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:44,468
Take it easy, Mary.
Take it easy.

717
00:57:45,712 --> 00:57:48,476
-Jesus!
-Come on, make your play.

718
00:57:48,815 --> 00:57:51,978
Would you just come on!
I don't need this shit today.

719
00:57:53,319 --> 00:57:54,718
Fucking redneck!

720
00:57:56,222 --> 00:57:57,621
Fascist!

721
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:03,958
Fucking faggots!

722
00:58:04,164 --> 00:58:06,132
You believe this shit?

723
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:09,057
Jesus!

724
00:58:10,003 --> 00:58:12,733
Alternate lifestyle, my ass!

725
00:58:14,073 --> 00:58:17,804
Imagine what those pumpkins do
with each other when they're alone!

726
00:58:18,144 --> 00:58:21,671
And what about the muff divers?
Think about it.

727
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:26,142
Sergeant Prendergast.

728
00:58:26,386 --> 00:58:27,614
She don't have to talk!

729
00:58:28,888 --> 00:58:31,755
What do you want!
I admitted it was a gang!

730
00:58:31,958 --> 00:58:33,755
She don't have to say a word!

731
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:38,454
I know it was a white guy.
We got to talk. It's important.

732
00:58:41,301 --> 00:58:43,064
How many guns...

733
00:58:43,303 --> 00:58:44,702
...were in the gym bag?

734
00:58:44,904 --> 00:58:48,533
I don't know what you're talking about.
I didn't see no gym bag!

735
00:58:48,908 --> 00:58:52,309
The white guy took it, right?
A lot more people could get hurt.

736
00:58:52,512 --> 00:58:53,740
Now help me out.

737
00:58:56,249 --> 00:58:59,275
The bag was already in the car
when I got in.

738
00:58:59,485 --> 00:59:00,884
How many guns were in it?

739
00:59:01,087 --> 00:59:02,577
I don't know.

740
00:59:04,591 --> 00:59:06,252
Lots of guns.

741
00:59:06,759 --> 00:59:09,250
They got all the guns in
the fucking world.

742
00:59:33,853 --> 00:59:34,842
Good?

743
00:59:40,326 --> 00:59:41,384
Can I help you?

744
00:59:41,628 --> 00:59:43,960
Police officer.
I'm looking for a man.

745
00:59:44,397 --> 00:59:45,864
Are you now?

746
00:59:47,066 --> 00:59:48,192
Late 30s...

747
00:59:48,534 --> 00:59:49,899
...white shirt and tie...

748
00:59:50,703 --> 00:59:53,001
...he'd be carrying a gym bag.

749
00:59:58,711 --> 01:00:00,440
What's the police scanner for?

750
01:00:01,214 --> 01:00:03,079
My own personal amusement.

751
01:00:04,550 --> 01:00:06,643
Have you seen anyone
like I've described?

752
01:00:06,986 --> 01:00:07,975
Nope.

753
01:00:08,554 --> 01:00:10,545
-Okay, thanks.
-Listen.

754
01:00:10,890 --> 01:00:12,323
T ell me something.

755
01:00:13,192 --> 01:00:15,387
Why don't they call you guys...

756
01:00:15,595 --> 01:00:17,961
...officer-esses?

757
01:00:18,498 --> 01:00:19,692
I beg your pardon?

758
01:00:19,899 --> 01:00:22,834
You know, like act-ress?
Like that?

759
01:00:26,072 --> 01:00:28,233
Something to signify...

760
01:00:29,342 --> 01:00:30,570
...you know.

761
01:00:33,346 --> 01:00:37,248
I guess they feel that a police officer
is a police officer...

762
01:00:37,583 --> 01:00:39,050
...not a...

763
01:00:40,019 --> 01:00:41,247
..."you know."

764
01:00:42,989 --> 01:00:44,957
Thanks for your cooperation, sir.

765
01:00:45,291 --> 01:00:48,624
Sorry I couldn't be of
more help, officer-ess.

766
01:00:58,171 --> 01:00:59,365
Why'd you do that?

767
01:00:59,639 --> 01:01:01,971
There's something I want to show you.

768
01:01:02,942 --> 01:01:06,207
I'm not going to turn you in.
I'm your friend.

769
01:01:07,146 --> 01:01:08,204
Come on.

770
01:01:09,649 --> 01:01:12,277
I don't bring just anybody back here,
you know.

771
01:01:12,485 --> 01:01:14,885
This is my own private stash.

772
01:01:15,822 --> 01:01:17,881
I got some great stuff here.

773
01:01:24,163 --> 01:01:26,324
World War l. Good shape.

774
01:01:27,867 --> 01:01:32,065
Speaking of gas, wait a minute.
Wait just a minute.

775
01:01:42,382 --> 01:01:44,179
You know what was in this?

776
01:01:44,817 --> 01:01:46,580
Zyklon-B.

777
01:01:47,453 --> 01:01:48,545
You remember?

778
01:01:48,888 --> 01:01:50,082
What the Nazis had?

779
01:01:52,558 --> 01:01:53,422
Listen.

780
01:01:56,729 --> 01:01:57,889
Empty.

781
01:01:58,331 --> 01:02:02,734
This was used, man.
This was actually used.

782
01:02:04,337 --> 01:02:08,000
I wonder how many kikes
this little can took out.

783
01:02:09,409 --> 01:02:11,843
Think about it. Here.

784
01:02:18,017 --> 01:02:20,008
Why are you showing me this?

785
01:02:20,853 --> 01:02:21,683
I'm not.

786
01:02:22,922 --> 01:02:25,516
That's just for fun.
You can keep that.

787
01:02:28,761 --> 01:02:31,286
This is what I want to show you.

788
01:02:32,098 --> 01:02:34,760
The real thing.

789
01:02:35,201 --> 01:02:38,398
Heat-seeking, shoulder-fired.
It's fucking disposable!

790
01:02:38,604 --> 01:02:41,266
You can take out a jet
with one of these monkeys.

791
01:02:43,276 --> 01:02:44,766
It's for you.

792
01:02:45,211 --> 01:02:47,202
I want you to have it.

793
01:02:47,780 --> 01:02:48,712
Why?

794
01:02:49,215 --> 01:02:51,080
Because I'm with you.

795
01:02:51,451 --> 01:02:54,318
Don't you get it?
I was listening to the police scanner.

796
01:02:54,620 --> 01:02:58,784
I heard about the Whammyburger.
Fucking fantastic!

797
01:02:59,125 --> 01:03:03,562
It's a bunch of niggers, right?
On TV, it's always white kids.

798
01:03:03,796 --> 01:03:07,254
But when you go in there,
it's nothing but a bunch of niggers!

799
01:03:07,733 --> 01:03:10,463
They'll spit on your food
if you're not nice to them.

800
01:03:10,670 --> 01:03:12,661
I know all about it.

801
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:15,764
I'm with you.

802
01:03:15,975 --> 01:03:18,375
We're the same, you and me.

803
01:03:18,578 --> 01:03:20,375
Don't you see?

804
01:03:20,580 --> 01:03:22,639
We are not the same.

805
01:03:23,249 --> 01:03:26,013
I'm an American.
You're a sick asshole.

806
01:03:28,387 --> 01:03:30,412
What kind of vigilante are you?

807
01:03:30,723 --> 01:03:33,351
I am not a vigilante.

808
01:03:33,759 --> 01:03:36,956
I'm just trying to get home for my
little girl's birthday.

809
01:03:37,163 --> 01:03:41,725
And if everybody will stay
out of my way, nobody will get hurt.

810
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:44,502
Fuck you!

811
01:03:44,837 --> 01:03:47,533
Who the fuck are you?
Are you fucking with me?

812
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:50,368
I am just disagreeing with you.

813
01:03:50,676 --> 01:03:54,874
In America, we have freedom of speech,
the right to disagree!

814
01:03:55,281 --> 01:03:57,215
Fuck you and your freedom!

815
01:03:57,416 --> 01:03:58,974
Who the fuck are you?

816
01:03:59,285 --> 01:04:01,378
You fuck!
You faggot fuck!

817
01:04:01,587 --> 01:04:03,054
Going to take my rocket.

818
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:06,817
I ought to shoot you, motherfucker!
Now turn around!

819
01:04:07,026 --> 01:04:09,654
Now lean on that counter!
Go on, lean on it!

820
01:04:16,102 --> 01:04:17,763
Look at this shit!

821
01:04:21,707 --> 01:04:23,902
What's this doing in there?

822
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:25,873
Faggot shit!

823
01:04:28,548 --> 01:04:32,416
You want freedom?
I'll give you fucking freedom!

824
01:04:32,618 --> 01:04:35,382
Further back.
Feet farther back.

825
01:04:36,222 --> 01:04:38,349
Spread them out.
Farther.

826
01:04:39,058 --> 01:04:42,357
You're going to jail, motherfucker!
How's that for freedom?

827
01:04:42,562 --> 01:04:46,259
Freedom to get fucked up the ass
by some big buck nigger.

828
01:04:46,532 --> 01:04:48,727
Give me your hand.
Put it back here.

829
01:04:51,404 --> 01:04:55,568
He's going to be right behind you,
just like this.

830
01:04:56,876 --> 01:04:59,902
Think about it.
You going to like that, faggot?

831
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:04,378
You going to like that, you faggot fuck?
Give me your other hand.

832
01:05:04,750 --> 01:05:06,718
-I can't.
-Why not?

833
01:05:06,919 --> 01:05:07,851
Gravity.

834
01:05:08,054 --> 01:05:10,386
Gravity?
What the fuck does that mean?

835
01:05:10,590 --> 01:05:12,148
I'll fall down.

836
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:17,288
Now give me your other hand!
Give it to me now!

837
01:05:17,763 --> 01:05:19,788
Give it to me! Give it to me!

838
01:05:20,099 --> 01:05:21,225
Come on!

839
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:23,161
Give it to me!

840
01:05:42,955 --> 01:05:44,786
This isn't one of mine.

841
01:06:00,873 --> 01:06:02,636
Oh, my God!

842
01:06:03,142 --> 01:06:05,042
Oh...my...

843
01:06:05,878 --> 01:06:07,368
-...God!
-Good!

844
01:06:08,014 --> 01:06:09,345
Freedom of religion.

845
01:06:09,882 --> 01:06:11,349
Now you get the swing of it!

846
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:14,281
Feels good to exercise your rights.

847
01:06:27,299 --> 01:06:28,459
Go on.
I'm listening.

848
01:06:28,668 --> 01:06:33,571
We got a nut case with a bag full
of guns in Hollywood, heading west.

849
01:06:34,173 --> 01:06:35,470
What's he up to?

850
01:06:35,675 --> 01:06:37,870
He's up to a lot of trouble.

851
01:06:38,077 --> 01:06:41,012
Never mind, we've got
a hallway full of suspects.

852
01:06:41,847 --> 01:06:44,714
It wasn't a gang thing.
I can tell you that.

853
01:06:44,917 --> 01:06:47,044
Angelina is a tramp and a liar.

854
01:06:47,253 --> 01:06:50,552
We don't appreciate you
interfering with our investigation.

855
01:06:50,756 --> 01:06:54,920
I've got a positive lD
on the gym bag, okay?

856
01:06:57,596 --> 01:06:59,086
What's this?

857
01:06:59,365 --> 01:07:00,662
A gym bag.

858
01:07:00,866 --> 01:07:03,596
Does this mean you're
putting me under arrest?

859
01:07:06,372 --> 01:07:07,930
You guys take off.

860
01:07:11,777 --> 01:07:14,337
I gave you that speech earlier...

861
01:07:14,547 --> 01:07:18,074
...because that's regulations.
They make me do it.

862
01:07:18,284 --> 01:07:21,014
This one's from me.
I've never liked you.

863
01:07:21,220 --> 01:07:25,350
You know why? You don't curse.
I don't trust a man who doesn't curse.

864
01:07:25,558 --> 01:07:30,222
Not a ""fuck"" or a ""shit"" in all
these years. Real men curse.

865
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:33,694
And I don't like a man
who's afraid to hit the street.

866
01:07:33,899 --> 01:07:36,424
-It's bad for morale.
-I'm not afraid.

867
01:07:36,635 --> 01:07:38,899
Get back behind that desk
where you belong...

868
01:07:39,138 --> 01:07:42,574
...and don't waste any more of my time
pretending you're a cop.

869
01:07:49,148 --> 01:07:50,775
A man in a white shirt and tie...

870
01:07:50,983 --> 01:07:53,645
...shot up a phone booth
near the Whammyburger.

871
01:07:54,620 --> 01:07:56,815
-Did you hear me?
-I heard you.

872
01:07:57,990 --> 01:08:00,288
Right about here, right?

873
01:08:00,493 --> 01:08:01,983
How did you know?

874
01:08:02,328 --> 01:08:04,728
He got the bag of guns
at the drive-by.

875
01:08:04,930 --> 01:08:06,295
Then you were right.

876
01:08:06,499 --> 01:08:07,625
Excuse me.

877
01:08:07,833 --> 01:08:09,994
-What's wrong with you?
-Me?

878
01:08:10,503 --> 01:08:13,563
I' m a coward, the captain told me.
Get out of my way.

879
01:08:13,773 --> 01:08:15,798
Hey, look. It is your own fault.

880
01:08:16,008 --> 01:08:19,136
You let everybody think you were spooked,
when it was your wife.

881
01:08:19,345 --> 01:08:21,142
She made you get off the street.

882
01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:25,578
What happens between me and my wife
is nobody's business but mine!

883
01:08:26,185 --> 01:08:28,085
Sorry, I've been a bitch all day.

884
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:31,154
She didn't make me quit.
I came home late one night...

885
01:08:31,357 --> 01:08:33,484
...and found her sitting in the dark.

886
01:08:33,692 --> 01:08:35,421
She thought I'd been killed.

887
01:08:35,628 --> 01:08:39,120
She thought I was a ghost.
I had to chase her through the house.

888
01:08:41,867 --> 01:08:44,028
-I'm sorry.
-Forget it.

889
01:08:45,037 --> 01:08:48,336
-Where are you going?
-See if I can earn my last day's pay.

890
01:08:48,541 --> 01:08:50,304
Let me go with you.

891
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:53,144
I thought you were on duty.

892
01:08:56,315 --> 01:08:57,976
What do you say, partner?

893
01:09:00,486 --> 01:09:01,714
Fuck them!

894
01:09:04,223 --> 01:09:05,383
Go!

895
01:09:19,738 --> 01:09:22,002
Who were you talkking to a while ago?

896
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:27,038
You' re just trying to scare me.

897
01:09:28,514 --> 01:09:29,811
Am I succeeding?

898
01:09:30,015 --> 01:09:33,746
No, you're not. So you just
might as well stop it.

899
01:09:34,854 --> 01:09:37,652
And you're not scaring me
out of my own house.

900
01:09:37,857 --> 01:09:39,222
And you 're not coming here.

901
01:09:39,425 --> 01:09:43,418
But I am. I ' m on my way.
You can count on that.

902
01:09:46,031 --> 01:09:48,591
I ' m past the point of no return.

903
01:09:50,269 --> 01:09:52,100
Do you know when that is?

904
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:55,999
That's the point in a journey...

905
01:09:56,208 --> 01:09:59,268
...where it's longer to go back
to the beginning...

906
01:09:59,545 --> 01:10:02,207
...than it is to continue
to the end.

907
01:10:03,716 --> 01:10:04,876
It's like....

908
01:10:05,784 --> 01:10:08,412
Remember when those astronauts
got in trouble?

909
01:10:08,621 --> 01:10:12,148
They were going to the moon
and something went wrong.

910
01:10:12,358 --> 01:10:13,985
They had to get back to Earth...

911
01:10:14,193 --> 01:10:17,560
...but they had passed
the point of no return.

912
01:10:18,430 --> 01:10:22,730
So they had to go all the way
around the moon to get backk...

913
01:10:22,968 --> 01:10:27,132
...and they were
out of contact for hours.

914
01:10:28,574 --> 01:10:32,032
Everybody waited to see
if a bunch of dead guys in a can...

915
01:10:32,244 --> 01:10:34,474
...would pop out the other side.

916
01:10:38,317 --> 01:10:40,080
That's me.

917
01:10:41,487 --> 01:10:43,819
On the other side of the moon now...

918
01:10:44,256 --> 01:10:46,087
...out of contact...

919
01:10:47,326 --> 01:10:51,387
...and everybody's just going to
have to wait till I pop out.

920
01:10:54,333 --> 01:10:55,664
The police are here.

921
01:10:58,103 --> 01:10:59,695
Did you kknow, Beth...

922
01:11:00,005 --> 01:11:04,101
...in certain South American countries
it's still legal...

923
01:11:04,343 --> 01:11:07,176
...to kill your wife if she
insults you?

924
01:11:10,349 --> 01:11:13,409
They're here right now.
I'm looking at one right now.

925
01:11:13,852 --> 01:11:15,149
Put him on the phone.

926
01:11:32,304 --> 01:11:35,364
-What are we going to do?
-Talk to the lKorean guy.

927
01:11:36,976 --> 01:11:38,807
Just start banging on doors.

928
01:11:51,790 --> 01:11:52,882
What is it?

929
01:11:56,829 --> 01:11:58,797
Where are you going?

930
01:11:58,998 --> 01:12:00,397
I'll be right back.

931
01:12:02,568 --> 01:12:05,560
I'm sure the guy will let you
use his bathroom.

932
01:12:19,585 --> 01:12:21,644
What are you doing?

933
01:12:32,865 --> 01:12:34,264
I know who this guy is!

934
01:12:34,466 --> 01:12:35,364
Who is he?

935
01:12:36,268 --> 01:12:39,601
He had a personalized license plate.
What the hell was it?

936
01:12:39,872 --> 01:12:42,067
It said, ""D-Fens.""

937
01:12:42,441 --> 01:12:43,430
Defense?

938
01:12:43,942 --> 01:12:46,775
D-dash-F-E-N-S.

939
01:12:47,946 --> 01:12:51,609
They said he was on his way home.
Go check out his address.

940
01:12:52,284 --> 01:12:53,273
Mr. Lee!

941
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:56,347
Defense!

942
01:13:23,916 --> 01:13:25,645
Hold it! Back up.

943
01:13:29,421 --> 01:13:32,390
You dumb bitch! You cut me off!
What's wrong with you!

944
01:13:32,591 --> 01:13:34,388
Move back! Out of the way!

945
01:13:34,593 --> 01:13:36,060
What are you, a moron?

946
01:13:36,261 --> 01:13:40,994
If I wanted to be in a parking lot,
I'd buy a ticket, you dumb bitch!

947
01:14:00,686 --> 01:14:02,950
Where are you going?
You can't go this way.

948
01:14:03,155 --> 01:14:04,452
What are you doing?

949
01:14:04,690 --> 01:14:07,124
Fixing the street!
What does it look like?

950
01:14:08,694 --> 01:14:10,594
Two days ago it was fine.

951
01:14:10,796 --> 01:14:13,128
You're saying it fell apart in two days?

952
01:14:13,465 --> 01:14:15,524
Well, I guess so.

953
01:14:17,035 --> 01:14:18,798
Pardon me, but that's bullshit!

954
01:14:19,271 --> 01:14:22,468
I don't think anything's
wrong with the street.

955
01:14:22,808 --> 01:14:25,106
You're just trying
to justify your budgets.

956
01:14:25,310 --> 01:14:27,403
-Are you nuts?
-I know how it works!

957
01:14:27,646 --> 01:14:31,639
If you don't spend your budget,
you won't get any money next year.

958
01:14:32,050 --> 01:14:34,951
I want you to admit
nothing's wrong with the street!

959
01:14:35,220 --> 01:14:36,551
Fuck you, pal!

960
01:14:37,189 --> 01:14:41,558
You're not going to hold us hostage
with these yellow lights and big trucks.

961
01:14:43,495 --> 01:14:46,794
I'm just here to keep people
from falling in. That's all.

962
01:14:47,166 --> 01:14:49,157
I want to hear it from you!

963
01:14:50,102 --> 01:14:51,569
What's wrong with the street?

964
01:14:52,404 --> 01:14:55,896
I don't know. I really don't.
I think it's a sewer job.

965
01:14:57,075 --> 01:14:58,406
You're lying.

966
01:14:59,178 --> 01:15:01,373
What's wrong with the street?

967
01:15:03,682 --> 01:15:04,740
Nothing.

968
01:15:07,085 --> 01:15:08,347
I knew it.

969
01:15:08,687 --> 01:15:11,087
I knew it was fine.

970
01:15:12,758 --> 01:15:14,726
But I'll give you something to fix.

971
01:15:15,928 --> 01:15:17,395
-Oh, Jesus--
-Here!

972
01:15:18,630 --> 01:15:21,155
Hey, Charlie!
Oh, please, man!

973
01:15:21,366 --> 01:15:23,493
We got a goddamn nut here!

974
01:15:25,204 --> 01:15:27,729
Fucking guy back there with a bazooka!

975
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:29,168
Pull that thing off.

976
01:15:29,374 --> 01:15:30,500
-What thing?
-That thing.

977
01:15:30,709 --> 01:15:33,337
Then pull on both ends.
It gets bigger.

978
01:15:34,279 --> 01:15:35,405
Like this?

979
01:15:35,614 --> 01:15:38,276
Now flip that thing up.
It's your aimer.

980
01:15:38,884 --> 01:15:41,785
-How do you know about this?
-I saw it on TV.

981
01:15:42,054 --> 01:15:44,022
What's the name of the movie?

982
01:15:44,223 --> 01:15:46,521
What's the name of the movie
you're making?

983
01:15:47,226 --> 01:15:49,922
Under Construction. You like it?

984
01:15:50,128 --> 01:15:52,289
It's all right. Where's the cameras?

985
01:15:52,564 --> 01:15:55,294
The cameras are--
Just stand back.

986
01:15:57,135 --> 01:15:59,103
What do I do now?

987
01:15:59,304 --> 01:16:03,536
Just look through the aimer.
What are you aiming at?

988
01:16:04,243 --> 01:16:06,803
That yellow monster down there.

989
01:16:07,746 --> 01:16:11,147
Look at it and pull the trigger.
It's really easy.

990
01:16:12,251 --> 01:16:13,218
Where's the trigger?

991
01:16:14,419 --> 01:16:16,250
That one right there.

992
01:16:16,989 --> 01:16:18,923
But aim first, man.

993
01:16:20,626 --> 01:16:21,854
Look out!

994
01:16:27,666 --> 01:16:31,261
-Nothing happened.
-Must've been a dud or something.

995
01:16:43,849 --> 01:16:45,180
Cool, man!

996
01:16:56,328 --> 01:16:58,353
What is it?
I'll sic the dog on you!

997
01:16:58,563 --> 01:17:00,292
Police officers, ma'am.

998
01:17:12,477 --> 01:17:13,808
How are you?

999
01:17:14,546 --> 01:17:16,138
Where's the dog?

1000
01:17:19,818 --> 01:17:21,308
He's dead.

1001
01:17:23,322 --> 01:17:26,655
-What is it?
-We need to ask you some questions.

1002
01:17:27,159 --> 01:17:29,286
Just a few questions, ma'am.

1003
01:17:29,494 --> 01:17:31,052
What kind of questions?

1004
01:17:31,563 --> 01:17:33,360
Do you have a warrant?

1005
01:17:33,565 --> 01:17:35,055
You invited us in.

1006
01:17:35,267 --> 01:17:37,633
Now I'm inviting you out.

1007
01:17:37,836 --> 01:17:40,532
What relation are you
to William Foster?

1008
01:17:40,739 --> 01:17:44,607
What are you saying? He's my son.
I don't want you here.

1009
01:17:44,810 --> 01:17:49,213
Would you look at this!
This is really amazing. Amazing!

1010
01:17:49,414 --> 01:17:53,214
Does he have another house,
another place he might call home?

1011
01:17:53,418 --> 01:17:55,045
Now this is a what?

1012
01:17:55,253 --> 01:17:57,084
-A dragon?
-Don't touch that!

1013
01:17:59,358 --> 01:18:01,656
Why would he do that?
This is his home.

1014
01:18:01,860 --> 01:18:04,727
-I want you to go now.
-Did this one melt?

1015
01:18:05,564 --> 01:18:07,657
That one there.

1016
01:18:11,603 --> 01:18:14,265
It's a giraffe, drinking.

1017
01:18:17,876 --> 01:18:20,606
Now, of all of these,
which is your very favorite?

1018
01:18:25,117 --> 01:18:27,381
Right now, I think this skunk.

1019
01:18:27,619 --> 01:18:29,052
That's lovely.

1020
01:18:30,222 --> 01:18:31,519
That's not paint.

1021
01:18:31,957 --> 01:18:33,390
You know, his stripe.

1022
01:18:33,625 --> 01:18:34,557
It isn't?

1023
01:18:34,793 --> 01:18:37,318
It might be,
but it's not painted on.

1024
01:18:38,063 --> 01:18:40,054
It's in the glass.

1025
01:19:22,641 --> 01:19:24,438
What the hell?

1026
01:19:26,278 --> 01:19:27,438
It's the groundskeeper.

1027
01:19:27,646 --> 01:19:30,945
Well if he is, he's out of uniform.
Hey, you there!

1028
01:19:31,516 --> 01:19:33,507
What are you doing there?

1029
01:19:34,119 --> 01:19:35,347
Just passing through.

1030
01:19:35,821 --> 01:19:39,154
Nobody said you could play through.
Get off my hole.

1031
01:19:39,624 --> 01:19:41,990
He said he was passing through.

1032
01:19:42,194 --> 01:19:44,355
He's not a member.
Look at the way he's dressed.

1033
01:19:44,563 --> 01:19:46,588
Would you get off my golf course?!

1034
01:19:46,998 --> 01:19:47,828
I am!

1035
01:19:48,033 --> 01:19:50,263
Go back the way you came!

1036
01:19:50,535 --> 01:19:53,095
I don't like his looks.
Leave him alone.

1037
01:19:53,305 --> 01:19:56,001
What am I paying my dues for?
This is my golf course!

1038
01:19:56,208 --> 01:19:58,676
If I want to play here, I will!

1039
01:19:58,877 --> 01:20:01,846
If he gets hit with my Titleist,
that's his problem!

1040
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:04,743
Don't yell at me.
I'm just here playing with you--

1041
01:20:05,250 --> 01:20:06,649
Fore!

1042
01:20:08,153 --> 01:20:09,142
Fore!

1043
01:20:15,994 --> 01:20:16,983
Five!

1044
01:20:17,562 --> 01:20:18,620
Wait a minute!

1045
01:20:18,830 --> 01:20:22,561
What the hell you trying to do?
IKill me with a golf ball?

1046
01:20:22,968 --> 01:20:26,028
It's not enough you got all this land
for your little game?

1047
01:20:26,238 --> 01:20:28,900
But you had to kill me
with a golf ball?

1048
01:20:29,574 --> 01:20:33,305
You should have children playing here,
family picnics....

1049
01:20:33,512 --> 01:20:35,480
You should have a petting zoo...

1050
01:20:36,248 --> 01:20:40,912
...instead of electric carts for you
old men with nothing better to do.

1051
01:20:51,429 --> 01:20:53,192
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

1052
01:20:54,099 --> 01:20:57,159
-I got to get some help!
-What's wrong with you?

1053
01:20:57,369 --> 01:20:59,428
-Help!
-Your heart?

1054
01:20:59,704 --> 01:21:02,639
Something's wrong with your heart?
What can I do?

1055
01:21:04,109 --> 01:21:05,770
Pills! Pills!

1056
01:21:06,278 --> 01:21:07,108
Pills?

1057
01:21:07,946 --> 01:21:08,970
Where are they?

1058
01:21:09,714 --> 01:21:11,306
Cart, cart.

1059
01:21:13,652 --> 01:21:17,520
Call the paramedics!
My friend just had a heart attack!

1060
01:21:17,722 --> 01:21:21,658
I guess you're out of luck.
Your little cart's going to drown.

1061
01:21:22,227 --> 01:21:25,754
Aren't you sorry you didn't let me
pass through your golf course?

1062
01:21:28,266 --> 01:21:33,169
Now you're going to die wearing that
stupid little hat. How does it feel?

1063
01:21:36,908 --> 01:21:38,808
This is his room.

1064
01:21:39,744 --> 01:21:42,042
You're a very neat and tidy lady.

1065
01:21:42,247 --> 01:21:44,738
Oh, he cleans his own room.

1066
01:21:45,150 --> 01:21:47,311
Now don't make me call you a liar.

1067
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:52,484
If he wasn't at work,
I'd be afraid to set foot in here.

1068
01:21:52,824 --> 01:21:54,621
What's he been doing lately?

1069
01:21:54,826 --> 01:21:56,293
Same as ever.

1070
01:21:56,494 --> 01:22:00,260
Building important things to
protect us from the Communists.

1071
01:22:01,099 --> 01:22:02,657
He works at Notec.

1072
01:22:03,001 --> 01:22:04,764
The defense plant.

1073
01:22:05,437 --> 01:22:07,029
D-Fens.

1074
01:22:08,073 --> 01:22:11,531
Why don't you call and see if
you can get him on the horn?

1075
01:22:14,779 --> 01:22:16,940
So what's going on
with your son?

1076
01:22:20,018 --> 01:22:23,010
-How do you mean?
-You know exactly what I mean.

1077
01:22:27,626 --> 01:22:31,357
Sometimes he sits through an entire meal
without saying a word.

1078
01:22:34,699 --> 01:22:37,759
He just shovels food into his mouth
like a machine.

1079
01:22:37,969 --> 01:22:39,869
I get so nervous...

1080
01:22:40,805 --> 01:22:42,636
...I can't swallow.

1081
01:22:43,375 --> 01:22:46,538
I'll sit there with
the same piece of food in my mouth.

1082
01:22:47,879 --> 01:22:51,110
I have to spit it on the plate.
When I do, he looks at me...

1083
01:22:51,316 --> 01:22:53,511
...Iike he'd like to kill me.

1084
01:22:55,887 --> 01:22:57,684
Don't tell him I said that.

1085
01:22:57,889 --> 01:22:59,356
I promise I won't.

1086
01:23:01,092 --> 01:23:05,085
I try not to be a burden.
I'm not just talking financial.

1087
01:23:05,296 --> 01:23:07,890
How could you be a burden to anyone?

1088
01:23:09,634 --> 01:23:12,068
If William, or Bill,
as I like to call him--

1089
01:23:12,303 --> 01:23:15,272
He likes Bill.
I call him Bill too.

1090
01:23:15,473 --> 01:23:17,373
If Bill said he was going home...

1091
01:23:17,575 --> 01:23:20,544
...could he have meant
where his wife and child live?

1092
01:23:20,745 --> 01:23:23,305
Ex-wife.
We shouldn't be in here.

1093
01:23:25,050 --> 01:23:28,816
Ex-wife, right. Elizabeth.
What's her maiden name?

1094
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:32,055
Trevino. She was part ltalian.
You know how they are.

1095
01:23:32,257 --> 01:23:34,748
-Where's Elizabeth now?
-I wouldn't know.

1096
01:23:36,194 --> 01:23:38,662
You don't know
where your grandchild lives?

1097
01:23:39,931 --> 01:23:44,197
He doesn't want me to know.
He blames me for what happened.

1098
01:23:47,338 --> 01:23:48,305
What's the word?

1099
01:23:50,542 --> 01:23:52,533
He was fired over a month ago.

1100
01:24:00,952 --> 01:24:03,386
Where has he been going every day?

1101
01:24:04,122 --> 01:24:06,647
Where has he been eating his lunch?

1102
01:24:20,872 --> 01:24:23,898
Why are you putting barbed wire
in that fence?

1103
01:24:24,142 --> 01:24:26,110
Is this how you rich people have fun?

1104
01:24:26,311 --> 01:24:29,405
You put barbed wire on the fence,
so innocent people...

1105
01:24:29,614 --> 01:24:31,047
...can cut their hands?

1106
01:24:32,650 --> 01:24:35,118
No, please, I'm the caretaker.

1107
01:24:35,420 --> 01:24:37,012
It's just a barbecue.

1108
01:24:37,822 --> 01:24:40,484
Dr. Ashcroft has let us do this before.

1109
01:24:42,327 --> 01:24:43,692
You don't live here?

1110
01:24:44,395 --> 01:24:46,420
Is it really necessary
to tell them?

1111
01:24:47,766 --> 01:24:49,028
Tell who?

1112
01:24:50,168 --> 01:24:51,226
Altmore Security.

1113
01:24:52,504 --> 01:24:54,438
Aren't you with them?

1114
01:25:03,681 --> 01:25:05,148
No, please!

1115
01:25:06,785 --> 01:25:08,946
It's okay, honey.
It's okay, baby.

1116
01:25:22,367 --> 01:25:24,358
What kind of doctor lives here?

1117
01:25:25,703 --> 01:25:27,261
Plastic surgeon.

1118
01:25:31,209 --> 01:25:33,302
Plastic surgery bought all this?

1119
01:25:35,313 --> 01:25:37,304
Guess I'm in the wrong racket.

1120
01:25:39,717 --> 01:25:42,811
They have correspondence courses
in plastic surgery?

1121
01:25:47,826 --> 01:25:49,487
I lost my job.

1122
01:25:49,994 --> 01:25:53,327
Actually, I didn't lose it.
It lost me.

1123
01:25:54,065 --> 01:25:57,398
I'm overeducated, underskilled.

1124
01:26:00,338 --> 01:26:02,829
Maybe it's the other way around.
I forget.

1125
01:26:03,174 --> 01:26:04,835
But I'm obsolete.

1126
01:26:07,011 --> 01:26:09,912
I'm not economically viable.

1127
01:26:14,419 --> 01:26:16,751
I can't even support my own kid.

1128
01:26:19,424 --> 01:26:20,652
Are you hurt?

1129
01:26:20,859 --> 01:26:24,260
I'm sorry. I didn't hurt you,
sweetheart. I'm sorry.

1130
01:26:24,696 --> 01:26:25,685
It's all right.

1131
01:26:26,598 --> 01:26:27,792
It's your hand.

1132
01:26:28,766 --> 01:26:30,757
You cut your hand.

1133
01:26:33,705 --> 01:26:35,536
It's my hand.

1134
01:26:40,945 --> 01:26:42,708
Please take me with you.

1135
01:26:44,382 --> 01:26:46,680
They won't do anything
if I'm with you.

1136
01:26:48,386 --> 01:26:49,944
Just let them go.

1137
01:26:54,125 --> 01:26:57,720
What do you think?
You think I want to hurt your family?

1138
01:27:01,399 --> 01:27:03,390
I have a family of my own.

1139
01:27:05,637 --> 01:27:06,661
You don't believe me?

1140
01:27:07,906 --> 01:27:09,567
We believe you.

1141
01:27:13,411 --> 01:27:16,574
That's where I'm going.
I'm going home to see my family.

1142
01:27:20,752 --> 01:27:23,084
It's my little girl's birthday today.

1143
01:27:25,089 --> 01:27:29,082
We were going to have a barbecue,
like you guys, and...

1144
01:27:30,428 --> 01:27:32,828
...she was going to play outside...

1145
01:27:34,098 --> 01:27:36,760
...and my wife would hold my hand...

1146
01:27:38,336 --> 01:27:40,668
...and talk about grown-up things.

1147
01:27:44,943 --> 01:27:46,843
And then when it got dark...

1148
01:27:48,446 --> 01:27:50,607
...we'd all go to sleep together.

1149
01:27:53,618 --> 01:27:56,018
We'd sleep together in the dark.

1150
01:27:59,123 --> 01:28:00,522
And everything...

1151
01:28:01,359 --> 01:28:03,953
...would be just like it was before.

1152
01:28:13,972 --> 01:28:17,430
You can't leave. Believe me,
something's happened to him.

1153
01:28:17,642 --> 01:28:20,839
It doesn't take all day
to drive from Pasadena to Venice.

1154
01:28:21,045 --> 01:28:24,208
That doesn't constitute
a threatening phone call.

1155
01:28:24,415 --> 01:28:26,975
The guy was talking about Star Trekk
or something.

1156
01:28:27,185 --> 01:28:30,985
-Just getting a kick out of scaring--
-Please don't leave.

1157
01:28:31,189 --> 01:28:34,215
There's only one thing you can do
to really feel safer.

1158
01:28:34,659 --> 01:28:36,684
Next time there's a proposition...

1159
01:28:36,894 --> 01:28:41,194
...to cut the number of patrol cars
on the street, vote no, okay?

1160
01:28:41,399 --> 01:28:43,560
Have a nice day.

1161
01:29:00,685 --> 01:29:02,380
What have you found so far?

1162
01:29:02,587 --> 01:29:04,316
No luck on Foster-T revino.

1163
01:29:04,522 --> 01:29:06,422
Go straight to the maiden name.

1164
01:29:07,091 --> 01:29:09,889
I've got something
on an Army-Navy store.

1165
01:29:10,094 --> 01:29:11,061
Where?

1166
01:29:11,262 --> 01:29:12,251
Here.

1167
01:29:14,032 --> 01:29:16,432
Jesus, Prendergast, I was there!

1168
01:29:16,768 --> 01:29:18,395
That guy was a prick.

1169
01:29:18,603 --> 01:29:20,264
You know what else he was?

1170
01:29:20,705 --> 01:29:24,368
Murdered. They found him stuffed
in his own display case.

1171
01:29:24,609 --> 01:29:25,940
Oh, my God!

1172
01:29:26,344 --> 01:29:28,278
Here, I'll help you change the--

1173
01:29:36,554 --> 01:29:38,522
You know what they did?

1174
01:29:38,723 --> 01:29:40,782
They turned our ice-cream parlor...

1175
01:29:40,992 --> 01:29:43,324
...into a Southwest-American,
New Age thing.

1176
01:29:43,561 --> 01:29:45,426
I went to buy a rocking horse.

1177
01:29:45,630 --> 01:29:49,259
All I could find was a unicorn
with an Indian on top of it.

1178
01:29:49,467 --> 01:29:52,561
Can you believe that, Elizabeth?
Can you believe it?

1179
01:29:55,473 --> 01:29:56,701
Come on!

1180
01:29:57,575 --> 01:29:59,839
Where are we going?
When's my birthday?

1181
01:30:44,755 --> 01:30:48,156
Some Gl Joe gave a geezer
a heart attack at the golf course...

1182
01:30:48,359 --> 01:30:51,089
...and accosted a family
right next door.

1183
01:30:51,295 --> 01:30:52,319
A Gl Joe?

1184
01:30:52,530 --> 01:30:56,466
He's wearing the kind of jacket
you find in an Army-Navy store.

1185
01:30:57,969 --> 01:31:00,301
I found her!
Trevino, Elizabeth.

1186
01:31:00,738 --> 01:31:01,568
Don't tell me.

1187
01:31:02,373 --> 01:31:03,635
Venice.

1188
01:31:04,876 --> 01:31:06,104
How'd you know?

1189
01:31:06,310 --> 01:31:08,471
Where else would an ltalian move to?

1190
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:11,371
Lookk what I got.

1191
01:31:13,151 --> 01:31:17,884
We got a puppy.
We got a puppy.

1192
01:31:20,224 --> 01:31:23,489
Happy birthday to you

1193
01:31:24,395 --> 01:31:27,728
Happy birthday to you

1194
01:31:43,347 --> 01:31:44,314
Hi, puppy!

1195
01:31:56,861 --> 01:31:58,761
No answer at the ex-wife.

1196
01:31:59,197 --> 01:32:02,166
-You send the cavalry?
-No, Pacific Division are pricks.

1197
01:32:02,366 --> 01:32:05,733
They can't send units to the same
address three times in a day...

1198
01:32:05,937 --> 01:32:08,064
...to comfort some hysterical woman.

1199
01:32:08,272 --> 01:32:10,604
-What do you want to do?
-Go to Venice.

1200
01:32:10,942 --> 01:32:12,273
Get that.

1201
01:32:13,277 --> 01:32:14,209
Prendergast here.

1202
01:32:14,412 --> 01:32:15,606
Who the fuck is this?

1203
01:32:16,113 --> 01:32:18,013
Shit. It's your wife.

1204
01:32:18,216 --> 01:32:19,683
Oh, boy. Hon?

1205
01:32:19,884 --> 01:32:22,682
Yeah, "hon." I know who that was!

1206
01:32:22,887 --> 01:32:25,412
Mr. Peepers just scratched
the shit out of me...

1207
01:32:25,623 --> 01:32:27,648
...and I'm bleeding like
a stuck pig.

1208
01:32:28,292 --> 01:32:30,021
Something important's come up.

1209
01:32:30,561 --> 01:32:32,426
What am l? Dog vomit?

1210
01:32:32,630 --> 01:32:34,723
Your wife says
she's bleeding to death...

1211
01:32:34,932 --> 01:32:37,230
...and you say
something important has come up?

1212
01:32:38,302 --> 01:32:40,793
-When are you coming home?
-I don't know.

1213
01:32:41,839 --> 01:32:44,364
Don't tell me you don't know.

1214
01:32:44,575 --> 01:32:47,976
I want to know when the hell
you're coming home, now!

1215
01:32:48,246 --> 01:32:50,646
Amanda, shut up!

1216
01:32:50,915 --> 01:32:52,644
Did you hear me?
Shut up!

1217
01:32:54,252 --> 01:32:57,983
I'll get home when I'm finished,
not a second before. Is that clear?

1218
01:32:58,556 --> 01:33:00,183
Is that clear?

1219
01:33:02,326 --> 01:33:05,090
You don't have to bite my head off!

1220
01:33:06,264 --> 01:33:10,428
And you have dinner ready
and waiting for me, okay?

1221
01:33:11,335 --> 01:33:15,203
And leave the skin on the chicken!
All right?

1222
01:33:18,276 --> 01:33:19,504
Goodbye.

1223
01:33:24,348 --> 01:33:25,679
Shit!

1224
01:33:26,417 --> 01:33:27,679
Let's go!

1225
01:33:28,019 --> 01:33:30,010
Surprise!

1226
01:33:33,024 --> 01:33:35,083
I' m sorry, Prendergast!

1227
01:33:35,293 --> 01:33:40,162
We tried and tried, but could not
fit your fucking name on the cake!

1228
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:45,168
Congratulations.
You made it out alive!

1229
01:33:45,369 --> 01:33:46,666
Listen, listen.

1230
01:33:46,871 --> 01:33:49,169
All right, hold it, hold it.

1231
01:33:49,407 --> 01:33:52,808
Ladies and gentlemen,
the moment you've been waiting for:

1232
01:33:53,044 --> 01:33:56,878
This afternoon's entertainment,
Miss Suzie!

1233
01:34:04,889 --> 01:34:06,379
Suzie Q!

1234
01:34:06,657 --> 01:34:08,648
Do your thing!

1235
01:34:09,427 --> 01:34:11,952
Is this the retiring boy?

1236
01:34:12,330 --> 01:34:14,355
Wait, wait!
This is great, guys.

1237
01:34:14,565 --> 01:34:18,467
This is great.
I appreciate it, but I can't stay.

1238
01:34:19,837 --> 01:34:23,238
Jesus! What's your problem?
You afraid of women too?

1239
01:34:23,441 --> 01:34:25,841
I don't blame him.
You ever met his wife?

1240
01:34:27,345 --> 01:34:28,312
What did you say?

1241
01:34:28,579 --> 01:34:30,171
-What?
-What did you say?

1242
01:34:30,381 --> 01:34:31,211
Nothing.

1243
01:34:31,415 --> 01:34:33,747
We don't have time for this.

1244
01:34:35,519 --> 01:34:36,850
You're right.

1245
01:34:42,793 --> 01:34:44,021
Ready, honey?

1246
01:34:48,866 --> 01:34:52,632
Happy Birthday to you

1247
01:34:53,537 --> 01:34:55,368
Happy Birthday...

1248
01:34:55,639 --> 01:34:56,970
...to you

1249
01:34:59,043 --> 01:35:00,101
No cakke for you?

1250
01:35:00,311 --> 01:35:02,677
If she doesn't want it,
don't force her.

1251
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:04,780
Okkay, you can have the teddy.

1252
01:35:04,982 --> 01:35:06,813
Time to go horsy!

1253
01:35:08,052 --> 01:35:10,646
It's okkay. Horsy!
It's okkay.

1254
01:35:11,155 --> 01:35:13,055
Giddyap, giddyap.

1255
01:35:18,829 --> 01:35:21,821
-She doesn't want to.
-Just put her on the horse!

1256
01:35:22,867 --> 01:35:26,325
There we go! Horsy ride.
Giddyap!

1257
01:35:26,570 --> 01:35:27,628
She doesn't want to.

1258
01:35:27,872 --> 01:35:29,237
Put her on the horse!

1259
01:35:29,740 --> 01:35:31,367
You can't force her.

1260
01:35:31,575 --> 01:35:33,975
I bought her the goddamn horse.

1261
01:35:34,178 --> 01:35:36,476
Here we go! Horsy ride.

1262
01:35:36,680 --> 01:35:39,410
You're scaring her!
I want you to stop this!

1263
01:35:43,921 --> 01:35:46,822
Come on, honey. It's her birthday.
It's the pier.

1264
01:35:47,024 --> 01:35:50,016
It's your favorite place.
You love the pier.

1265
01:35:53,564 --> 01:35:55,031
Why do you do this?

1266
01:36:22,226 --> 01:36:23,625
Take the back.

1267
01:36:27,965 --> 01:36:29,227
Freeze!

1268
01:36:56,927 --> 01:36:57,894
You okay?

1269
01:36:58,095 --> 01:37:00,495
-l' m all right.
-Somebody get an ambulance.

1270
01:37:00,831 --> 01:37:04,392
Get an ambulance! Call 9 1 1!
Get an ambulance!

1271
01:37:04,602 --> 01:37:09,096
T ell them an officer's been shot!
Go, go, go! Get an ambulance!

1272
01:37:11,675 --> 01:37:12,607
Be careful!

1273
01:37:14,778 --> 01:37:16,245
Go get the bastard!

1274
01:37:16,447 --> 01:37:18,347
He's still dressed like Gl Joe!

1275
01:38:12,836 --> 01:38:15,066
Daddy! Mommy, look!
Daddy!

1276
01:38:33,090 --> 01:38:33,920
Hi, honey.

1277
01:38:34,358 --> 01:38:36,258
I thought I'd find you here.

1278
01:38:39,029 --> 01:38:40,360
Leave us alone!

1279
01:38:41,599 --> 01:38:43,931
What? I can't talk to my wife?

1280
01:38:44,501 --> 01:38:46,059
I'm not your wife anymore.

1281
01:38:46,270 --> 01:38:50,206
No? Sugar, does this ring a bell?
"Till death do us part"?

1282
01:38:51,275 --> 01:38:52,765
Do you remember that?

1283
01:38:59,550 --> 01:39:00,608
I'm sorry.

1284
01:39:00,951 --> 01:39:02,418
Sorry, sorry.

1285
01:39:02,720 --> 01:39:03,687
What're you doing?

1286
01:39:03,921 --> 01:39:06,583
I'm coming home from a hard day
at the office.

1287
01:39:06,790 --> 01:39:08,951
God bless the working stiffs!

1288
01:39:16,433 --> 01:39:18,628
Please, leave her alone!

1289
01:39:29,546 --> 01:39:31,070
You're so big!

1290
01:39:33,083 --> 01:39:34,482
How'd you get so big?

1291
01:39:37,888 --> 01:39:39,150
I missed it.

1292
01:39:39,990 --> 01:39:41,981
They stole it from me, honey.

1293
01:39:42,993 --> 01:39:45,928
Don't worry. They're not
going to take it anymore.

1294
01:39:51,335 --> 01:39:53,166
Bill, listen, please.

1295
01:39:55,673 --> 01:39:57,664
You've got to stop this!

1296
01:40:01,745 --> 01:40:03,007
You need help.

1297
01:40:05,015 --> 01:40:06,107
You're sick.

1298
01:40:07,151 --> 01:40:08,379
Sick?

1299
01:40:09,053 --> 01:40:10,816
You want to see sick?

1300
01:40:11,055 --> 01:40:13,285
Take a walk around this town.
That's sick.

1301
01:40:13,490 --> 01:40:15,151
You ain't kidding.

1302
01:40:18,562 --> 01:40:21,395
Would you believe that
I used to fish right here?

1303
01:40:24,168 --> 01:40:25,897
This very spot?

1304
01:40:26,670 --> 01:40:30,231
Now they tell you,
"Don't eat the fish. It's poisonous."

1305
01:40:30,908 --> 01:40:33,172
You can't even swim
in the water.

1306
01:40:33,544 --> 01:40:36,342
It'll give you some kind of
bacterial infection.

1307
01:40:38,082 --> 01:40:39,845
How's that for sick?

1308
01:40:40,350 --> 01:40:43,376
I'm having a private moment
with my family. Leave us alone.

1309
01:40:43,787 --> 01:40:45,414
I'm leaving soon.

1310
01:40:46,790 --> 01:40:49,520
I'm retiring to Arizona.
Lake Havasu City.

1311
01:40:50,094 --> 01:40:51,220
Ever been there?

1312
01:40:51,462 --> 01:40:52,486
That's not what I mean!

1313
01:40:55,132 --> 01:40:59,068
They call it a lake, but it's really
just a big bowl of muddy water.

1314
01:40:59,269 --> 01:41:01,760
But the wife thinks it's paradise.

1315
01:41:02,706 --> 01:41:05,698
Everybody has their own idea
of what paradise is.

1316
01:41:09,046 --> 01:41:10,240
Take me, for instance.

1317
01:41:12,950 --> 01:41:14,884
You know what I thought
paradise was?

1318
01:41:15,252 --> 01:41:17,379
-What?
-lf you'll excuse me.

1319
01:41:19,356 --> 01:41:20,550
Making babies.

1320
01:41:21,592 --> 01:41:24,425
Ain't that a kick?
Making babies.

1321
01:41:26,029 --> 01:41:27,587
This your little girl?

1322
01:41:28,599 --> 01:41:29,691
Beautiful.

1323
01:41:32,102 --> 01:41:33,262
She's special.

1324
01:41:38,041 --> 01:41:40,839
You know, my wife never was
cut out for motherhood.

1325
01:41:41,879 --> 01:41:42,868
She did it all for me.

1326
01:41:43,080 --> 01:41:45,947
Went through all that pain,
lost her figure.

1327
01:41:46,950 --> 01:41:49,885
Then the kid went to sleep one night,
never woke up.

1328
01:41:51,121 --> 01:41:53,282
They called it ""lnfant Death...

1329
01:41:54,792 --> 01:41:56,054
...Syndrome."

1330
01:41:57,461 --> 01:42:00,191
But she wasn't an infant.
She was 2 years old.

1331
01:42:00,397 --> 01:42:02,058
She was a big girl.

1332
01:42:03,801 --> 01:42:05,393
She was our baby.

1333
01:42:08,639 --> 01:42:11,540
Here, darling, this is for you.
Here you go.

1334
01:42:18,081 --> 01:42:19,275
What can you do?

1335
01:42:21,251 --> 01:42:23,481
If she'd been hit by a drunk driver....

1336
01:42:24,421 --> 01:42:27,254
But who do you blame
when they just don't wake up?

1337
01:42:27,758 --> 01:42:28,725
Thank you, sweetheart.

1338
01:42:32,729 --> 01:42:34,458
There's a guy back there
with a gun!

1339
01:42:38,569 --> 01:42:40,298
No! Don't!

1340
01:42:42,105 --> 01:42:43,129
Elizabeth, no!

1341
01:42:43,941 --> 01:42:46,501
Freeze!
You're under arrest.

1342
01:42:46,777 --> 01:42:47,937
Get out of here!
Go on!

1343
01:42:48,846 --> 01:42:50,177
Freeze!

1344
01:42:53,684 --> 01:42:56,084
-What were you going to do?
-I don't know!

1345
01:42:56,286 --> 01:42:58,447
Guys like you always say that!

1346
01:42:58,655 --> 01:43:03,024
You know exactly what you were going
to do, kill your wife and child!

1347
01:43:04,528 --> 01:43:09,124
Then it'd be too late to turn back.
It'd be easy to kill yourself.

1348
01:43:09,566 --> 01:43:13,161
Let's go meet some nice policemen.
They're good guys. Let's go.

1349
01:43:14,605 --> 01:43:15,629
I'm the bad guy?

1350
01:43:21,879 --> 01:43:23,369
How did that happen?

1351
01:43:25,382 --> 01:43:27,816
I did everything they told me to.

1352
01:43:31,088 --> 01:43:33,022
Did you know I build missiles?

1353
01:43:33,557 --> 01:43:35,457
I help to protect America.

1354
01:43:38,896 --> 01:43:40,864
You should be rewarded for that.

1355
01:43:41,064 --> 01:43:44,556
Instead, they give it to
the plastic surgeon. They lied to me.

1356
01:43:47,004 --> 01:43:50,804
Is that what this is about?
You' re angry because you got lied to?

1357
01:43:51,341 --> 01:43:53,707
Is that why my dinner's
drying out in the oven?

1358
01:43:54,578 --> 01:43:57,570
They lie to everybody.
They lie to the fish!

1359
01:43:59,016 --> 01:44:02,008
That doesn't give you any right
to do what you did today.

1360
01:44:02,653 --> 01:44:07,420
The only thing that makes you special
is that little girl. Now let's go.

1361
01:44:08,659 --> 01:44:09,853
Let's go!

1362
01:44:17,334 --> 01:44:19,029
Sure was hot today,
wasn't it?

1363
01:44:21,905 --> 01:44:23,964
He has a gun!
There, on the pier!

1364
01:44:24,174 --> 01:44:27,007
IKeep this crowd back!
Let's get some backup!

1365
01:44:31,782 --> 01:44:33,249
You know, I got a gun.

1366
01:44:39,623 --> 01:44:40,885
In my pocket.

1367
01:44:45,562 --> 01:44:46,688
I got lots of guns.

1368
01:44:46,897 --> 01:44:48,626
Stay there.
Don't move!

1369
01:44:49,900 --> 01:44:50,764
You want to draw?

1370
01:44:51,468 --> 01:44:54,130
Let's not.
Let's call it a day.

1371
01:44:54,338 --> 01:44:55,737
Now come on.

1372
01:44:56,306 --> 01:44:57,739
It's perfect.

1373
01:44:58,775 --> 01:44:59,605
Showdown...

1374
01:45:00,410 --> 01:45:02,776
...between the sheriff
and the bad guy?

1375
01:45:04,414 --> 01:45:05,574
It's beautiful.

1376
01:45:10,787 --> 01:45:11,754
On three.

1377
01:45:11,955 --> 01:45:15,550
This doesn't have to be the end, Bill.
You have a choice.

1378
01:45:15,759 --> 01:45:19,388
See, my little girl is dead.
I don't have a choice. You do!

1379
01:45:19,663 --> 01:45:21,756
No, you have two choices:

1380
01:45:22,265 --> 01:45:23,459
I can kill you.

1381
01:45:24,668 --> 01:45:26,135
Or you can kill me...

1382
01:45:26,837 --> 01:45:29,601
...and my little girl
can get the insurance.

1383
01:45:32,442 --> 01:45:33,272
One....

1384
01:45:33,477 --> 01:45:34,876
You want to see her grow up?

1385
01:45:36,179 --> 01:45:37,942
Behind bars?

1386
01:45:41,318 --> 01:45:42,148
Two....

1387
01:45:42,352 --> 01:45:43,944
Don't do this.
Please.

1388
01:45:45,589 --> 01:45:46,954
-Let's go!
-Three.

1389
01:45:56,066 --> 01:45:58,034
I would have got you.

1390
01:46:37,674 --> 01:46:41,872
What cooperation was there between
the Pacific Division and Downtown?

1391
01:46:42,079 --> 01:46:44,547
Not to denigrate
the Venice Police Department...

1392
01:46:44,748 --> 01:46:47,911
...but it was one of our fellows
that put this together.

1393
01:46:48,251 --> 01:46:49,582
Prendergast!

1394
01:46:50,353 --> 01:46:53,845
This is Sergeant Prendergast.
Damn fine work, Prendergast.

1395
01:46:54,257 --> 01:46:57,317
Fuck you, Captain Yardley.
Fuck you very much!

1396
01:46:57,527 --> 01:46:59,552
I can't believe--
Did he just say that?

1397
01:46:59,763 --> 01:47:01,025
You're welcome.

1398
01:47:05,268 --> 01:47:07,566
-You still here?
-Afraid so.

1399
01:47:07,771 --> 01:47:10,797
We've stabilized her.
She'll be all right.

1400
01:47:11,007 --> 01:47:13,066
I'll see you at the hospital.

1401
01:47:16,446 --> 01:47:17,777
How are you doing?

1402
01:47:21,618 --> 01:47:23,245
I haven't told her yet.

1403
01:47:24,454 --> 01:47:25,785
Oh, shit!

1404
01:47:27,290 --> 01:47:29,952
It's her birthday.
What should I do?

1405
01:47:31,228 --> 01:47:32,786
Tell her tomorrow.

1406
01:47:33,430 --> 01:47:35,091
Let her have her little party.

1407
01:47:42,739 --> 01:47:45,207
-What's your name, darling?
-Adele.

1408
01:47:45,442 --> 01:47:46,466
Adele?

1409
01:47:46,810 --> 01:47:48,141
That's a nice name.

1410
01:47:48,879 --> 01:47:51,939
If I had a little girl,
I'd want her to be named Adele.

1411
01:47:52,149 --> 01:47:54,640
-What's yours?
-Mine?

1412
01:47:56,653 --> 01:47:58,314
My name is mud.

1413
01:48:00,357 --> 01:48:02,484
Your name is not mud.

1414
01:48:02,826 --> 01:48:05,761
It will be when my wife
finds out that...

1415
01:48:05,996 --> 01:48:07,588
...I'm still a cop.

1416
01:48:13,003 --> 01:48:14,163
Excuse me.

1417
01:48:18,341 --> 01:48:20,309
Sergeant just signed us out.

1418
01:48:20,510 --> 01:48:23,104
-All right, let's eat.
-Where you want to go?

1419
01:48:23,947 --> 01:48:26,745
Let's go around the corner
and get one of those things....

1420
01:48:32,122 --> 01:48:35,023
Lookk what I got!

1421
01:48:38,528 --> 01:48:40,860
Just call him, "Hi, Puppy. "

1422
01:48:41,364 --> 01:48:42,797
Hi, Puppy.

1423
01:48:44,201 --> 01:48:45,691
Hi, Puppy.

1424
01:48:50,874 --> 01:48:53,968
There we go.
We got everybody there.

1425
01:48:54,878 --> 01:48:56,812
We got everybody--

1426
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:03,000
" Falling Down"
The End
