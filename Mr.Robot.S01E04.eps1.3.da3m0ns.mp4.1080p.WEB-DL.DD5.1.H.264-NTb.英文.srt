30
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,530
Steel Mountain. The hacker's dilemma.

31
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:11,410
What to do when a bunch of data you want to destroy

32
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:13,200
is completely off the grid?

33
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,680
Hello, Evil Corp. We are fsociety.

34
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,190
Man of the hour. Take a curtsy.

35
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:22,070
Dark Army?

36
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:23,780
They got no code. They hack for anyone:

37
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,650
terrorists, North Korea, Iran, Russia--

38
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,670
Yo, yo, yo, yo, my album just dropped.

39
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:28,820
Please buy my CD.

40
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,450
He has my bank account, Ollie.

41
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:34,260
We cannot just infect Allsafe's network because of this.

42
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,240
Can we please hear the plan?

43
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,010
Where are we at with Steel Mountain?

44
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,370
I know how to take out the backups without blowing up the pipeline.

45
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,470
What do normal people do when they get this sad?

46
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:47,560
They reach out to friends or family.

47
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:49,900
I do morphine.

48
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,780
There it is.

49
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,590
After all the searching, scraping, dusting,

50
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,190
That's all that's left.

51
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,030
One line. The last line.

52
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,550
The consequences of busting Vera and meeting Mr. Robot,

53
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:32,900
creating you--everything till now, this moment.

54
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:36,760
I chose this. I chose all this.

55
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:43,100
Data storage facilities like Steel Mountain--

56
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:46,560
it's linear-tape open standard 9.

58
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,430
Temp value between 61 and 95.

59
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,140
Iron oxide in mag tape--

60
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:54,220
it sticks to polyurethane with a binder.

61
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:05,130
If hvac conditions surpass the ceiling 95 degrees,

62
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,060
polyurethane adhesive mollifies and tape data is unreadable.

63
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,710
This is what we're doing.

64
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,580
This circuit board, if installed behind a thermostat,

65
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,040
it lets us plant an asymmetric back door

66
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,630
then create a VPN in the Steel Mountain intranet.

67
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,560
Okay, we all know what a Raspberry Pi is.

68
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,790
What's your point?

69
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,100
He wants to hack Steel Mountain's climate control system,

70
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,000
raise the facility's heat high enough to destroy all the tapes.

71
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,800
And you think sticking this behind the thermostat will do all that?

72
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,100
With the right software specifically designed.

73
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,960
I'll pull up my research on the facility,

74
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,930
start targeting which thermostats are the most accessible.

75
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,210
Yeah, well, that's all well and good,

76
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,670
but we still gotta get in the damn joint.

77
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,800
There. Deep in the Adirondacks.

78
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,200
In 145-plus acre former limestone mine.

79
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,750
3-ton steel gates, 24/7 armed guards,

80
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,890
closed circuit cameras, NOC staffing.

81
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,390
Sure you don't want to just blow it up?

82
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:39,340
All we need is one security flaw.

83
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:42,240
Look at this place, man. It was built not to have any.

84
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:47,730
I see about... six walking around.

85
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,820
You okay, man?

86
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,820
What the hell?

87
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,330
Where you going?

88
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,940
We're done, aren't we?

89
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,930
That was about the time the withdrawal started.

90
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,260
Remember?

91
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,010
I know--I broke my own rule.

92
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:20,960
But I have no suboxone.

93
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:25,270
What I do have--clinical depression, social anxiety.

94
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,810
A day job, a night job, confusing relationships.

95
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,380
Others depending on me.

96
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,740
Taking down the largest corporation in the world.

97
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:35,690
And I chose it all.

98
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,760
This line has wanted to own me my whole life.

99
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,690
Biosynthesized in some lab in Mexico, packed into a pill,

100
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:45,650
shipped to the states where it was packaged

101
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:48,040
with a logo and taxed by the government,

102
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,770
stolen by a bribed guard, sold to a Vera henchman,

103
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:53,710
then oversold to Shayla, and then to me.

104
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:57,070
It needs me just as much as I need it.

105
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,830
The moment was destined, every choice bringing me

106
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,750
closer to this one line.

107
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:05,070
This line. This last line.

108
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:06,930
I promise.

109
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,360
Today will be the worst of it.

110
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,130
Get through the next couple days, and then I'll be clean.

111
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:41,820
What do you want?

112
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,270
It's me, open up.

113
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,580
I would have saved you the trip to the door

114
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,640
but you're all, like, against me breaking in or whatever.

115
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,200
Why are you here?

116
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,340
Romero got some clarity on your little plan

117
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,040
that's gonna need your undivided.

118
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,780
- Okay, let's go. - What's going on with you?

119
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,050
You look like shit.

120
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,120
I'm fine.

121
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,580
Look, man. This plan's not gonna work.

122
00:06:58,130 --> 00:06:59,720
Why? Why is that?

123
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,500
I was doing recon on Steel Mountain.

124
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,780
Came up with a problem. A big, fat one.

125
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,630
Evil Corp's upping their security protocol.

126
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,260
If you ask me, it's overkill, but it's legit.

127
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:13,490
I already told you, they have their vulnerabilities.

128
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:15,940
So what happens after we hack the New York facility?

129
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,800
Then we have to take a trip to Nashville,

130
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,000
then Colorado, then San Jose,

131
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:23,150
then goddamn Tallahassee.

132
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,530
Ugh, this looks real bad. Real bad.

133
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,450
They are physically copying then shipping

134
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,320
all the analog backups.

135
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:34,210
Five big-ass fortress-like redundancies across the country.

136
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:37,190
Now maybe--and it was always a big maybe--

137
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,820
we get into one, but no way we get into all of them.

138
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,730
The minute we fry one facility,

139
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:44,480
they'll patch every climate control system they own.

140
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:47,440
No matter how you slice it, the plan is DOA.

141
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,690
Where'd you get this?

142
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:50,480
What the hell do you mean?

143
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,520
We're still in Evil Corp's network.

144
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,130
Shit.

145
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,840
This is what Tyrell was talking about.

146
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,370
What'd you just say?

147
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,880
Tyrell? As in Tyrell Wellick?

148
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:05,800
Yeah.

149
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,800
Since when did you and the goddamn CTO

150
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,500
of Evil Corp become, what, chums?

151
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:16,350
Says this isn't happening till April 1st.

152
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,360
It's only the 29th.

153
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,640
We still got a few days.

154
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,390
We have time.

155
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,290
All their tapes are still in the New York facility.

156
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:30,310
Just means we go up today.

157
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,430
We're nowhere close to being ready.

158
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:40,730
Well, I've already downloaded all the necessary PDFs of the floor plans

159
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,380
to target the thermostats.

160
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,360
It will require some planning,

161
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,900
But nothing I can't do in the car.

162
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:48,190
It shouldn't take me long to own the facility's scada network.

163
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,670
Especially with some help.

164
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:51,570
You guys hit the road

165
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:54,480
while Trenton helps me finish the distro.

166
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,570
We'll double-time it.

167
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,280
You can get it off the FTP server as soon as you get there.

168
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,170
What about China?

169
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:01,320
We'd have to execute the hack before Tuesday.

170
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,210
Don't worry about China.

171
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,970
I'll hit up my Dark Army contact as soon as you take off.

172
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,780
Oh, you just gonna hit up

173
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,630
the world's most dangerous hacker crew?

174
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,300
Ya'll have gone and misplaced your collective minds.

175
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,320
We've been planning this for months.

176
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:20,870
Now we're gonna go up on a lark just 'cause he said so?

177
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,450
This plan is shit.

178
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,380
The plan will work.

179
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:27,120
And once we're actually there,

182
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,220
plus we have no idea who physically's gonna go in.

183
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:40,390
It's my plan. I'll go in.

184
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:41,990
Look, man, you...

185
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,050
You might be able to hide it from these nerds,

186
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:47,200
but I know a junkie when I see one.

187
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,920
In your condition, you ain't gonna do Jack or Jill

188
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,280
except puke your brains out

189
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,350
or give hand jobs for another high.

190
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,340
Like you said,

191
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,900
in three days, one Steel Mountain becomes five.

192
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,140
That's no good for any plan.

193
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,400
Something ain't right about this guy.

194
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,520
Yeah, well. He's gotten us this far.

195
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,630
Still, I don't trust him.

196
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,790
Well, it's not about trust, remember?

197
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:20,100
Thank you, mom.

198
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,430
- There it is. - All right.

199
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,270
Come to daddy.

200
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,590
Yo, man.

201
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,820
You gonna say anything about this?

202
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:09,860
What's there to say?

203
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,810
You seem to have everything under control.

204
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,420
Yeah. Okay.

205
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,650
This isn't my operation.

206
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,460
I told you before.

207
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,410
You're the key to the whole thing.

208
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,810
You're the only force of nature at play here.

209
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,800
There's a saying.

210
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,260
The devil's at his strongest

211
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,100
while we're looking the other way,

212
00:11:57,390 --> 00:12:00,400
like a program running in the background silently,

213
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,520
while we're busy doing other shit.

214
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,950
Daemons, they call them.

215
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:09,200
They perform action without user interaction.

216
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,240
Monitoring, logging, notifications.

217
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,430
Primal urges,

218
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:16,740
repressed memories,

219
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,460
unconscious habits.

220
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,650
They're always there, always active.

221
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,750
We can try to be right,

222
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,540
we can try to be good,

223
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,480
we can try to make a difference,

224
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,230
but it's all bullshit.

225
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,590
'Cause intentions are irrelevant.

226
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,600
They don't drive us. Daemons do.

227
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:37,550
And me? I've got more than most.

228
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,340
I just need to rest a minute, okay? I'll be fine.

229
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,480
Bullshit--a couple hours,

230
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,370
you'll wish you felt as shitty as you do right now.

231
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,200
Wait till the convulsions start.

232
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,460
Full body pains, leaking from everywhere, then--

233
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,490
Hypersensitivity to brightness and sound.

234
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:57,220
After that, overwhelming paranoia

235
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:59,490
followed by the darkest of depressions.

236
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:01,530
Symptoms may persist for two weeks,

237
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,580
assuming I last that long.

238
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,870
Yeah, I know what's in store.

239
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:07,900
Romero may have a point.

240
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,250
You're not gonna be good for anything till you kick this.

241
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,470
I...It burns.

242
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,550
Don't be mad at me.

243
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:22,540
I know I slipped, but I'm about to change the world.

244
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,820
I'm about to change the world.

245
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,340
Shit.

246
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:58,370
Mm, that is the way I like to get up in the morning.

247
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:01,560
Screw coffee or breakfast in bed.

248
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,990
The first thing I could see every day

249
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,570
is that sweet butt of yours.

250
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,720
I'd be the happiest dude in the city.

251
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,470
Are you going somewhere, babe?

252
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:13,430
Yeah, um, I'm gonna meet my dad for brunch.

253
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:14,550
What? No, babe.

254
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:16,370
I was gonna take you to brunch.

255
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,250
I mean, I know that things are, like, okay

256
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,350
between us right now, but I'm--I'm not

257
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:24,980
gonna let myself off easy, all right?

258
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:27,630
You will be wined, and you will be dined

259
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:30,480
until I feel I've gotten myself out of the doghouse.

260
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,350
Well, we can do something tonight, then.

261
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:34,830
Perfect.

262
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,210
- Okay. - No.

263
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,350
Is Elliot around? I tried texting him.

264
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:47,030
Uh, he didn't text me back.

265
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,040
Yeah, he's gone for the day,

266
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,190
which is why I'm on Flipper duty.

267
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,070
Where is he?

268
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:54,220
Shit if I know.

269
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:55,690
I mean, I don't ask details,

270
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:58,250
but he only ever tells me what he wants anyway, right?

271
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:01,410
And I'll tell him you stopped by.

272
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,040
Do you want to walk with us?

273
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:13,140
Flipper loves an audience when she pees.

274
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,390
Sure. Yeah. I gotta...

275
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,740
head back towards the subway anyway.

276
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,860
Oh, we don't plan our path.

277
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:26,040
I mean, we just kind of wing it and see where the moment takes us.

278
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:27,670
Come on.

279
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,970
Come on, before she bursts.

280
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:38,220
Maybe this was all intentional.

281
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,550
My subconscious, running in the background,

282
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:43,670
making me doubt what I got everyone else to believe in.

283
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:47,290
Turning me into the physical manifestation of my fear

284
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:47,880
of being a...

285
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,570
Goddamn waste.

286
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:50,960
Just give him a night to recover, okay?

287
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,270
- We still have tomorrow. - This shit'll last a week.

288
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,300
And I refuse to waste my time playing nurse.

289
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,820
We gotta get back, regroup, start devising a plan b.

290
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,880
The rabbit is in the administration system.

291
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,080
- Send a flu shot. - Rabbit, flu shot...

292
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,680
- Someone talk to me. - A rabbit replicates

293
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:10,020
till it overloads a file, then it spreads like cancer.

294
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:10,910
Cancer?

295
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,210
Hollywood hacker bullshit.

296
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:13,980
I been in this game 27 years.

297
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:17,250
Not once have I ever come across an animated singing virus.

299
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:20,470
I have yet to fly through a Tron city directory structure.

300
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:23,590
I bet you right now some writer's working hard on a TV show

301
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:26,900
that'll mess up this generation's idea of hacker culture.

302
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,120
All you had to do is ask, klepto.

303
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,830
I've updated the FTP.

304
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:09,390
All the files are ready.

305
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:11,600
- I've created... - Any word from the road?

306
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,350
Jesus, it's been a full 24 hours.

307
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:17,220
Where the hell could they be?

308
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:19,980
Got any Advil?

309
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,380
I'm guessing you didn't make contact.

310
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:27,790
Nope.

311
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:30,660
Perhaps this plan was a little too ambitious.

312
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,580
We'll wait until the rest of them get back

313
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,880
and then reevaluate.

314
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,980
Sitting here helpless while we crash and burn?

315
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,360
Not my speed.

316
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,660
Even if they hack into steel mountain,

317
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,360
we need to hit China's data centers simultaneously.

318
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:43,920
If the Dark Army isn't compliant,

319
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,630
then there's not much we can do.

320
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:51,010
God... Shit!

321
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,610
I got so wasted, I forgot it's Sunday.

322
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:55,040
I know where my guy will be.

323
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:56,710
Is that wise?

324
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:59,340
Those guys aren't known for being the most understanding.

325
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,060
I'm assuming if he wanted contact--

326
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,450
What about what I want?

327
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:06,810
I'm coming with you.

328
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,670
No, thank you.

329
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:11,760
You stick around, wait for the boys to FTP it.

330
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,080
Hey, Trenton.

331
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,140
Here.

332
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:44,570
- What is this? - Come on, they're my last two.

333
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:48,410
Is this ecstasy?

334
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:49,900
No, it's clarity.

335
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:53,570
It'll help you see past whatever's bringing you down.

336
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,220
I'm sorry. I don't mean to be rude.

337
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:58,460
I...don't do drugs.

338
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,810
I mean, I-I smoke weed--

339
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:03,150
Well, sorry, but there's no take-backs, so...

340
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:05,920
Besides, don't you want to figure your shit out?

341
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:10,670
For me, sometimes when I'm going through something,

342
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:12,850
just gotta--I don't know.

343
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,230
Forget about it for a little while.

344
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:58,640
Are you seriously drinking a goddamn sparkling water right now?

345
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:01,590
If you weren't wearing my scarf, I'd kick your ass.

346
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:06,900
I think we should go.

347
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,910
Trust me--he's here every Sunday, okay?

348
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:12,500
He'll show.

349
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,800
Jesus Christ, Romero. What are we gonna do?

350
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:23,370
We dump him at a hospital,

351
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:25,510
come up with an alternative course of action.

352
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:26,970
That's our only option.

353
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:28,440
No. No hospital.

354
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,200
Then we split. Screw it.

355
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,980
I mean, you say it all the time yourself,

356
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,970
there's casualties in every revolution.

357
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:35,960
All that matters is the end result.

358
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,660
We got no time to haul dead weight.

359
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:40,140
Fine! You wanna leave, leave.

360
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,090
Screw this, man.

361
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,380
I need a hit.

362
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:03,930
I'll be better.

363
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:05,640
Just to get me through this.

364
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:07,000
I can't let you do that.

365
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,380
One hit.

366
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,280
You know, just to get me back on the road.

367
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:16,030
We don't have time. This...

368
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,890
needs to happen now.

369
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,360
One hit.

370
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:33,070
Come on.

371
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,330
Let's go.

372
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:41,990
Excuse me, fella.

373
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:43,750
You lookin' for something?

374
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,420
He could really use a helping hand.

375
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,080
Yeah, okay, he can go in. But only him.

376
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:52,440
Uh, no can do. I gotta come with.

377
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:55,870
Only if you're partaking, otherwise he goes it alone.

378
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:01,620
Here you go.

379
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:03,470
30.

380
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,190
30.

381
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,540
The guy in the house will set you up right.

382
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,410
Long as he doesn't kill you.

383
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:19,030
All right, look, the minute you're done...

384
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:20,670
you leave.

385
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:24,010
You don't look at anyone. You don't talk to anyone.

386
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,390
You take care of business and you get out.

387
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:29,900
Nod if you understand.

388
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:01,950
You want?

390
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,680
Big eyes.

391
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,360
It's all good, man. Go on.

392
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,440
I just...

393
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,740
I need morphine. Pills.

394
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:18,660
No, man.

395
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:20,890
This is all we got right here.

396
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,700
It's better.

397
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,480
Trust me.

398
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:30,760
Go on.

399
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,510
There you go. There you go.

400
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:35,320
I'll help.

401
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:40,460
It'll be okay. I'll help.

402
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,990
Have I sunk this low?

403
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:51,080
What must you think of me?

404
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:54,060
Is it spring? Election year?

405
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:55,630
Shall I hibernate?

406
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:59,350
Did we meet? In money we trust.

407
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:03,180
No, I created-- stop.

408
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:06,700
I can't control thoughts. I need this.

409
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:09,510
I know I promised my last line, but...

410
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,250
That's right.

411
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:24,360
Greedy bitch!

412
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:40,630
Shit, man--

413
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,660
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,

414
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:49,530
here's that seven-day forecast for the tri-state area.

415
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:52,570
Lots of clouds today, but mostly sunny through Thursday

416
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:54,560
with temperatures in the mid to the upper 80s.

417
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:58,030
And you will notice that the humidity will be a tad uncomfortable.

419
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,520
Dear brothers and sisters,

420
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,940
now is the time to open your eyes.

421
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,350
If you have not yet woken up to the reality of

422
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:09,360
profiteering and enslavement we've been warning you about,

423
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,420
I hope you realize you are fast running out of time.

424
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:15,730
The governments of the world and their corporate masters

425
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:17,460
do not want us to speak.

426
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,860
Why? Because we unlock truths.

427
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:22,830
We expose villains. We exorcize demons.

428
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:25,450
Citizens of the world, we are here to help.

429
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:28,260
If you have any interest in waking from your slumber,

430
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:31,380
in retrieving lost, damaged, or stolen memory,

431
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,780
we are here for you.

432
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:35,700
We have your back. We are fsociety.

433
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,720
What's it open?

434
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,850
It belongs to you now.

435
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,470
Made in the orient.

436
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,740
Made just for your head.

437
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,180
Now, find your monster, then turn the key.

438
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,560
But first...

439
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:30,120
a word from our corporate overlords!

440
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:34,300
If you see our logo, that means you can rest assured

441
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:36,030
that you're buying the best food,

442
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,490
clothing, shelter,

443
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:39,900
transportation, hygiene, electronics,

444
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,800
and life's necessities that money can buy.

448
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:31,690
Hello.

449
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,410
Hello, friend.

450
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:37,950
But we're not friends.

451
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:43,240
Can you tell me what happened to that house?

452
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:48,620
First can you tell me? What's your monster?

453
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,190
I think you dropped this.

454
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,440
Don't be shy now.

455
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,420
You can come closer.

456
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:41,320
Unsettling, I know.

457
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,930
Your pet beta fish chatting you up.

458
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,260
But time's money, Elliot.

459
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,610
You need something?

460
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:52,650
Your water-- does it need changing?

461
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:56,500
When you live in a fishbowl, ain't no such thing as change.

462
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:58,800
My entire life's been spent in this thing.

463
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,630
My whole world's on your side table.

464
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:04,890
I look around-- same shit, different day.

465
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,970
The lighting, the furniture.

466
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:09,740
Even the sounds-- always the same.

467
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,100
I'm on a loop,

468
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,540
and it won't stop unless my life does.

469
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:17,340
I'm exhausted with this world.

470
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:20,000
What can I do? I wanna help.

471
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,970
I think it's pretty obvious.

472
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,970
There's really only one thing you can do

473
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,660
for a brother in a fishbowl.

474
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:27,630
What is it?

475
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,950
Move him to a goddamn window!

476
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:48,360
Angela, he's my friend.

477
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:50,790
Yes.

478
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:53,170
And he's delicious.

479
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:57,850
Here.

480
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,020
Eat this.

481
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:09,720
Open.

482
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,160
It's piping hot, so consume with caution.

483
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:27,260
Pop's famous raspberry pie. Enjoy.

484
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,250
Yes.

485
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:49,220
Yes!

486
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,570
Yes, Elliot, I do.

487
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,400
Elliot, I do!

488
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:57,440
I do!

489
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:49,870
Those people in there...

490
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:55,380
I just told them what they wanted to hear.

491
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:00,980
You're not gonna do it, are you?

492
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,000
Change the world.

493
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:08,800
Figures. You were only born a month ago.

494
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:13,080
You're afraid.

495
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:16,770
Afraid of your monster.

496
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:19,780
Do you even know what it is?

497
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,230
It doesn't fit.

498
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:34,500
Why not?

499
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,720
Isn't it obvious?

500
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,790
You're not Elliot.

501
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,500
You're the--

502
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,500
Hello?

503
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:52,980
Hello?

504
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:15,330
Am I still alone?

505
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:18,040
Is this the face of my only friend?

506
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:20,160
Are you my monster?

507
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:26,300
I am here. You are alone.

508
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,850
They all left.

509
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:45,320
They all left.

510
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:54,470
I'm alone.

511
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:59,180
I'm alone.

512
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:02,430
I'm alone.

513
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,560
No, you're not.

514
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,390
I'm not going anywhere, kiddo.

515
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:17,380
We're in this to the end.

516
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:33,840
Maybe you should just walk. Ballet seems out of your skill set.

517
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,210
What? Screw you, young'un!

518
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:38,430
This bitch can plie with the best of 'em.

519
00:34:38,430 --> 00:34:40,930
You know, when I'm not bangin' on a keyboard,

520
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:43,520
I'm schooling classmates with moves like this!

521
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:45,570
Oh, my God.

522
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,230
Good lookin' out.

523
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:02,150
I'm sorry he never came.

524
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:09,160
Let's--let's just go.

525
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:12,030
I am a menace to society!

526
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,360
What?

527
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:21,290
- Wait, where are you going? - It's him.

528
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:00,520
Phone. Now!

529
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:02,340
Come on.

533
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,630
Why am I still out?

534
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:34,920
I have to be at work - in four hours!

535
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:39,310
There's a lot I'm gonna miss about this gig.

536
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,410
What are you gonna do for money now?

537
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,840
Oh, you know. Just be a hottie waitress.

538
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:48,080
I'm, uh-- oh, thank you.

539
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,520
Glad you liked it.

540
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:53,300
Although I am glad I got in one last hurrah

541
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,810
before going all corporate.

542
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:57,510
You're not worried?

543
00:36:58,070 --> 00:36:59,150
Worried about what?

544
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:01,260
I don't know.

545
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:04,290
I always get worried before starting a new job.

546
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:07,630
No. I am definitely not worried.

547
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:09,680
Worry's a waste of time.

548
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:12,380
I mean, shit didn't work out at one job, so I got another.

549
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:13,910
That's all!

550
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,570
You worry a lot, don't you?

551
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:22,610
Yeah.

552
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,330
Look in the mirror.

553
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,570
See that badass bitch?

554
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:03,140
That's the only person you should ever worry about.

555
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,470
Do you know how hard it's been for me to find you?

556
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,280
Come here.

557
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:44,410
Yo, you need to chill.

558
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,570
Go to hell, asshole!

559
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:49,370
There she is.

560
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:53,450
A ray of sunshine in the dark void of my existence.

561
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:54,790
Oh, poetic.

562
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:56,540
But not an apology.

563
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,090
I ain't apologizing for shit.

564
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:01,150
Oh, this is because I dumped your ass.

565
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:04,450
For real? You're gonna start pissing me off.

566
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:05,930
Sorry I wanted to spend my life with you.

567
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:07,390
What a monster I am.

568
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:09,890
Things are happening, Cisco.

569
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:11,380
We need to go tomorrow.

570
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:13,100
It's our only shot.

571
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,640
Then you never had one.

572
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,620
Look, I'm serious, Darlene.

573
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:19,320
These guys don't mess around.

574
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,510
Now, whatever it is you think you're doing--

575
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:22,600
freeing the world, freeing the masses--

576
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,470
the guys I work for,

577
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:26,090
they ain't motivated by kumbaya shit like that.

578
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,650
All right? Now, I'm warning you...

579
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,050
for the last time.

580
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:37,200
Oh, come on.

581
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:58,860
You know how much this means to me.

582
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,460
Please...

583
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:04,000
Just talk to them.

584
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,930
My aunt Esther cured all her habits with this--

585
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:18,680
liquid anti-diarrheal for the--well, you know.

586
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:21,750
Lemon and salt for the electrolytes,

587
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:23,880
decongestant for the runny nose.

588
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,870
This is the third one.

589
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:26,610
Seven more, you'll be good as new.

590
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:35,900
I'm gonna go pull the van around.

591
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,740
Make sure he keeps chugging those.

592
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:39,880
Thanks.

593
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:43,280
Cool.

594
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:45,800
Hello again.

595
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:47,750
Long time no...

596
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:49,950
whatever it is we do.

597
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:53,390
I missed you. Where did you go?

598
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:55,720
Did you leave, or did I?

599
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:08,070
Maybe it was both.

600
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,440
Or neither. Doesn't matter.

601
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:30,680
Did those hopeful moments scare me?

602
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:34,280
Of course. Daemons, remember?

603
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:44,150
At some point an "action without user interaction"

604
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:46,410
will come along and sweep my legs.

605
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:51,660
This spinning wheel of false highs and true lows will continue.

606
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,560
That much I know.

607
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:59,100
Daemons-- they don't stop working.

608
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:00,860
They're always active.

609
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:06,470
They seduce. They manipulate.

610
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:07,950
They own us.

611
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:14,490
And even though you're with me,

612
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,940
even though I created you, it makes no difference.

613
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:20,080
We all must deal with them alone.

614
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:21,800
The best we can hope for--

615
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:24,520
the only silver lining in all of this--

616
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:26,270
is that when we break through,

617
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:29,370
we find a few familiar faces

618
00:44:29,410 --> 00:44:31,120
waiting on the other side.
