19
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:50,000
The world of investing can be a jungle.

20
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,260
Bulls. Bears.

21
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,220
Danger at every turn.

22
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,480
That's why we at Stratton Oakmont

23
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,350
pride ourselves on being the best.

24
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,230
Trained professionals to guide you

25
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:04,890
through the financial wilderness.

26
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,980
Stratton Oakmont.

27
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,940
Stability.

28
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,730
Integrity.

29
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,610
Pride.

31
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:16,030
One!

32
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,820
Two!

33
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,490
Three!

34
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:28,500
Twenty-five grand to the first cocksucker who nail a bull's-eye!

35
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,340
Come on! Let's go!

36
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,010
One!

37
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:35,510
Two!

38
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:37,720
Three!

39
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,340
My name is Jordan Belfort.

40
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,640
Not him.

41
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,430
Me. That's right.

42
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,830
I'm a former member of the middle class

43
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:46,320
raised by two accountants

44
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,350
in a tiny apartment in Bayside, Queens.

45
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:50,530
The year I turned 26,

46
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:53,110
as the head of my own brokerage firm,

47
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,820
I made $49 million,

48
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,160
which really pissed me off

49
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,320
because it was three shy of a million a week.

50
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,620
No, no, no. My Ferrari was white,

51
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,180
like Don Johnson's in Miami Vice.

52
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:08,870
Not red.

53
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:15,420
See that humongous estate down there?

54
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,840
That's my house.

55
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:19,860
My wife, Naomi,

56
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,800
the Duchess of Bay Ridge, Brooklyn,

57
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:25,010
a former model and Miller Lite girl.

58
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:27,140
Yeah.

59
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,770
She was the one with my cock in her mouth in the Ferrari.

60
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,400
So put your dick back in your pants.

61
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,190
In addition to Naomi and my two perfect kids,

62
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,150
I own a mansion, a private jet,

63
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,860
six cars, three horses,

64
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:42,530
two vacation homes, and a 170-foot yacht.

65
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,450
Anchors aweigh!

66
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,210
I also gamble like a degenerate. I drink like a fish.

67
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:55,090
I fuck hookers maybe five, six times a week.

68
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:58,010
I have three different federal agencies looking to indict me.

69
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,760
Oh, yeah, and I love drugs.

70
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,520
One more round.

71
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,440
- Oh, you like it? - Yeah.

73
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,870
Pull up. Pull up!

74
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,120
We're gonna crash, for Christ sake!

75
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,450
Relax!

76
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,500
Just relax.

77
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,630
- You okay? - Yeah, I'm all right.

78
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:44,300
Good job.

79
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,970
You get in there safe, all right?

80
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,890
Till the next time, brother.

81
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,520
Till next time.

82
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:59,360
Yup, on a daily basis I consume enough drugs

83
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:04,860
to sedate Manhattan, Long Island and Queens for a month.

84
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,990
Okay, Mr. Jordan.

85
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,660
I take Quaaludes 10 to 15 times a day for my "Back pain,"

87
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,580
Adderall to stay focused,

88
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,580
Xanax to take the edge off, pot to mellow me out,

89
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:18,630
cocaine to wake me back up again and morphine, well,

90
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,170
because it's awesome.

91
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,380
Good morning, Nathan.

92
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,640
But of all the drugs under God's blue heaven,

93
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,770
there is one that is my absolute favorite.

94
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:38,810
You see, enough of this shit'll make you invincible.

95
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,610
Able to conquer the world,

96
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,820
and eviscerate your enemies.

97
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,950
And I'm not talking about this.

98
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:50,950
I'm talking about this.

99
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,830
See, money doesn't just buy you a better life,

100
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,420
better food, better cars, better pussy.

101
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,800
It also makes you a better person.

102
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,900
You can give generously to the church

103
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,470
or political party of your choice.

104
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:08,680
You can save the fucking spotted owl with money.

105
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:14,130
I always wanted to be rich.

106
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,690
So let me go back.

107
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:18,060
I'm 22 years old, newly married,

108
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:20,730
and already a money-crazed little shit.

109
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,980
So what do I do?

110
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,530
I go to the one place on earth

111
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,400
that befit my high-minded ambitions.

112
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,070
I love you.

113
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,710
You are lower than pond scum.

114
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,760
You got a problem with that,

115
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,510
Jordan?

116
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,680
No. No problem at all.

117
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,470
Good. Because that is what you are.

118
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,930
Pond scum.

119
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,270
Your job is connector,

120
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,230
which means

121
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:58,100
that you'll be dialing the phone over 500 times a day

122
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:01,110
trying to connect me with wealthy business owners.

123
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:03,150
And until you pass your Series 7,

124
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,440
that is all you're gonna fucking be doing. Sit.

125
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:06,780
Sit!

126
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:11,200
Now just so you know, last year I made over $300,000.

127
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,870
The other guy you'll be working for, he made over a million.

128
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,580
A million dollars?

129
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:19,620
I could only imagine what a douchebag that guy must be.

130
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:22,630
- Jordan Belfort. - Yes, sir.

131
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,380
- Mark Hanna. - A pleasure to meet you.

132
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:24,890
And you as well.

133
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:27,050
I see you've already met the village asshole.

134
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,760
Smile and dial.

135
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,340
And don't pick up your fucking head until 1:00.

136
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:32,970
Hey, fuck him.

137
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,630
I'm the senior broker here.

138
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:35,680
He's just a worthless piker.

139
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,560
Why don't you blow me, Hanna?

140
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,980
Now did you really pitch a stock in your job interview?

141
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,180
I had to do something to stand out.

142
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:42,810
Right, sir?

143
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,570
I fucking love that.

144
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,780
- Lunch. Today. - Yeah.

145
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,700
We don't start dialing at 9:30

146
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,660
because our clients are already answering the phone.

147
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:56,370
Three. Two. One.

148
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:57,450
Let's fuck!

149
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,120
You want to know what money sounds like?

150
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:03,170
Go to a trading floor on Wall Street.

151
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,710
"Fuck" This, "Shit" That.

152
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,340
"Cunt," "Cock," "Asshole."

153
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,510
I couldn't believe how these guys talked to each other.

154
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:09,880
- Good fucking package... - Piece of shit!

155
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,590
I was hooked in seconds.

156
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,850
It was like mainlining adrenaline.

157
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:17,220
Yeah. Fuckface, look at where the stock's at today, huh?

158
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:18,080
You motherfucker,

159
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,180
you can't get any at 44...

160
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:22,560
- Pick up the cocksucking phone! - Sorry...

161
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,480
You are such a fucking douchebag, Hanna.

162
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:30,320
We don't give two shits about how technology works

163
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,030
because all we care about is getting fucking rich.

164
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,410
- Solid, 2,000. - Jordan Belfort.

165
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:37,910
Done!

166
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,620
Time to paint the tape.

167
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:43,960
2,000. Microsoft. Going in the hole!

168
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,330
Come on.

169
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,090
Live. Live. Hold on, that is hot.

170
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:53,090
In. In. Shut that motherfucker. Shut it! Shut it! Shut it!

171
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,300
Sold!

172
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,000
Tootski?

173
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,500
Oh, no. Thank you, though.

174
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,370
Mr. Hanna,

175
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,170
what can I bring for you on this glorious afternoon?

176
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,960
Well, Hector, here's the game plan.

177
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:32,510
You're gonna bring us two Absolut Martinis.

178
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:34,130
You know how I like them. Straight up.

179
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,840
And then precisely seven and one half minutes after that,

180
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:38,260
you're gonna bring us two more.

181
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:41,640
Then two more after that every five minutes

182
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,930
until one of us passes the fuck out.

183
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,650
Excellent strategy, sir.

184
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:48,560
I'm good with water for now.

185
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:49,980
Thank you.

186
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:51,940
It's his first day on Wall Street.

187
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:52,940
Give him time.

188
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:55,740
- Thank you. - Thank you.

189
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,780
Mr. Hanna?

190
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:01,290
You're able to do drugs during the day

191
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,160
and then still function, still do your job?

192
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,080
How the fuck else would you do this job?

193
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,330
Cocaine and hookers, my friend.

194
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,840
Right.

195
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,520
Well, I got to say,

196
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:15,630
I'm incredibly excited to be a part of your firm. I mean...

197
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,590
The clients you have are absolutely...

198
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,140
Fuck the clients.

199
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,970
Your only responsibility is to put meat on the table.

200
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,310
You got a girlfriend?

201
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,940
I'm married. I have a wife.

202
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,100
Her name is Teresa. She cuts hair.

203
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,480
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

204
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,900
Think about Teresa.

205
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,150
Name of the game.

206
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:37,070
Move the money from your client's pocket into your pocket.

207
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,240
Right.

208
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,990
But if you make your clients money at the same time,

209
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,330
it's advantageous to everyone. Correct?

210
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,160
No.

211
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,160
Number one rule of Wall Street.

212
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,330
Nobody...

213
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,640
I don't care if you're Warren Buffett

214
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,590
or if you're Jimmy Buffett.

215
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:54,010
Nobody knows if a stock is gonna go up, down,

216
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,300
sideways, or in fucking circles.

217
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,380
Least of all stockbrokers, right?

218
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:01,050
It's all a fugazi. You know what a fugazi is?

219
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,510
Fugayzie. It's a fake.

220
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,020
Fugayzi, fugazi, it's a whazy, it's a woozy, it's...

221
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,440
Fairy dust. It doesn't exist.

222
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,310
It's never landed. It is no matter.

223
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,940
It's not on the elemental chart.

224
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,020
It's not fucking real.

225
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,940
- Right? - Right.

226
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,740
Stay with me.

227
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:20,110
We don't create shit. We don't build anything.

228
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,370
No.

229
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:24,290
So if you got a client who bought stock at eight

230
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:26,790
and it now sits at 16, he's all fucking happy.

231
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,300
He wants to cash in, liquidate,

232
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,960
take his fucking money and run home.

233
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,000
- You don't let him do that. - Okay.

234
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,960
- 'Cause that would make it real. - Right.

235
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,300
No. What do you do?

236
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,340
You get another brilliant idea.

237
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,880
A special idea.

238
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,070
Another "situation."

239
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,550
Another stock to reinvest his earnings and then some.

240
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,890
And he will, every single time.

241
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,060
'Cause they're fucking addicted.

242
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,890
And you just keep doing this,

243
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:51,230
again and again and again.

244
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:53,980
Meanwhile, he thinks he's getting shit rich,

245
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,150
which he is, on paper.

246
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,900
But you and me, the brokers,

247
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,320
we're taking home cold hard cash

248
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,110
via commission, motherfucker.

249
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,910
Right.

250
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:06,630
That's incredible, sir.

251
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:08,580
I can't tell you how excited I am.

252
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,120
You should be.

253
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:13,960
There's two keys to success in the broker business.

254
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,630
First of all...

255
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,670
- You gotta stay relaxed. - Yeah.

256
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,880
Do you jerk off?

257
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,010
Do I... Do I jerk off?

258
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,310
Yeah. Yeah, I jerk off. Yeah.

259
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,680
How many times a week?

260
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:30,350
Like three or four.

261
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,580
Three or four times, maybe five.

262
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,730
Gotta pump those numbers up.

263
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:35,310
Those are rookie numbers in this racket.

264
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,070
I myself, I jerk off at least twice a day.

265
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:42,480
Once in the morning right after I work out,

266
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,410
then once right after lunch.

267
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:44,870
Really?

268
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:47,870
I want to. That's not why I do it.

269
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:50,080
I do it 'cause I fucking need to.

270
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,660
Think about it. You're dealing with numbers.

271
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,710
All day long, decimal points, high frequencies.

272
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,130
Fucking digits.

273
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,630
All very acidic above-the-shoulders mustard shit.

274
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,970
All right?

275
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,550
It kind of wigs some people out. Right.

276
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,760
You got to feed the geese to keep the blood flowing.

277
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:10,520
I keep the rhythm below the belt.

278
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,850
Done.

279
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,600
This is not a tip, this is a prescription.

280
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:14,850
Trust me.

281
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,440
If you don't, you will fall out of balance,

282
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,650
split your differential and tip the fuck over.

283
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:21,030
Or worse yet,

284
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:23,320
I've seen this happen, implode.

285
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,860
No, I don't want to implode, sir.

286
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,120
No. No, you don't.

287
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,450
I'm in it for the long run, you know?

288
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:29,120
- Implosions are ugly. - Yeah.

289
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,370
Pop off to the bathroom, work one out any time you can.

290
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,450
When you get really good at it,

291
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:33,580
you'll fucking be stroking it

292
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,670
and you'll be thinking about money.

293
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:40,840
Second key to success in this racket

294
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,170
is this little baby right here.

295
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,630
It's called cocaine.

296
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,010
Right.

297
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:46,940
It'll keep you sharp between the ears.

298
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,930
It'll also help your fingers dial faster.

299
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:50,390
And guess what?

300
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,020
That's good for me.

301
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,020
Yes, sir.

302
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:56,270
Revolutions. You follow?

303
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,440
Revolutions.

304
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,770
Keep the clients on the Ferris wheel.

305
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:00,740
And it goes.

306
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,400
The park is open 24/7, 365,

307
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:06,410
every decade, every goddamn century.

308
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:07,910
That's it.

309
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:09,700
The name of the game.

310
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,290
Halkidiki?

311
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:13,500
Thank you.

312
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,930
Come on.

313
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,060
We're the common denominator.

314
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:44,150
Keep it up for me.

315
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,150
You've seen the echo

316
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,780
And the money comes in

317
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,280
The parade comes to town

318
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:52,160
Going down Broadway

319
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,830
It's a one-way street

320
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,160
Whichever way I go

321
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:00,460
The next six months,

322
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,880
I got to know the ins and outs of Wall Street.

323
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:06,590
Earning shit money as I geared up to take my Series 7.

324
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:12,810
Oh, fuckers.

326
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:24,690
Then I was a licensed broker at last,

327
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,740
ready to make my fortune.

328
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:31,410
My first day as a future Master of the Universe.

330
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:41,000
I have Exxon at 86 and a quarter six months ago.

332
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,460
Today it is trading at 36 and a half.

333
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,710
Mr...

334
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:51,090
They called it Black Monday.

336
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,390
No shit.

337
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:56,560
By 4:00 p.m., the market had dropped 508 points.

338
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,430
The biggest plummet

339
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,480
since the crash of '29.

340
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,940
I know your family, you know mine.

341
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:04,020
No, I don't know. Some fucking country in Europe took a shit.

342
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,440
Let them do what they want to fucking do.

343
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:06,780
Our market's solid.

344
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,490
This is not something that you want to sell.

345
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:10,150
You know what happened? A fucking tsunami.

346
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,530
I think you're making a big mistake.

347
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,030
Yes, I will talk to your wife.

348
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,200
Trust me, do not answer the phone.

349
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,920
A lot of people are gonna be calling you,

350
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:17,240
trying to get your dirty laundry.

351
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:18,620
We don't know what's going on here.

352
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:19,960
I know. I know.

353
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,380
Holy

354
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,300
fucking shit!

355
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,720
Unbelievable.

356
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:41,270
My first shitty day as a broker.

357
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,160
Within a month,

358
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,770
L.F. Rothschild,

359
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,390
an institution since 1899,

361
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:48,570
closed its doors.

362
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:51,070
Wall Street had swallowed me up

363
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,530
and shit me right back out again.

364
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:59,200
We could pawn my engagement ring if we needed to.

365
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:00,790
- Babe... - Because I don't mind.

366
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:01,960
If we needed to, I'm saying...

367
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,580
- Will you listen to me? - Okay.

368
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,790
You're not pawning anything. Okay?

369
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,250
- Okay. - What do I always tell you?

370
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,460
You're gonna be a millionaire.

371
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:11,050
That's right. Okay? Just let me look.

372
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,220
We'll find something.

373
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:13,970
- How about this? - What?

374
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:16,510
Nobody Beats the Wiz, the electronics store.

376
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,060
Stock boy. What do you think?

377
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,390
You're not gonna work at that place.

378
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,520
Yeah, but, you know, you start off...

379
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,680
Jordan, you're gonna be miserable at that place

380
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:22,810
- if you go there. - I know.

381
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:25,100
It's sales. You work your way up, you'll be a general manager.

382
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:26,980
- You're not gonna be a stock boy. - Why not?

383
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,730
'Cause you're a stockbroker.

384
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,190
You understand that nobody's hiring stockbrokers right now?

385
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,740
You understand that?

386
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,280
Okay?

390
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:41,040
This place is.

391
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:42,830
- What? - What's that say?

392
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,120
"Stockbrokers."

393
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,880
In Long Island?

394
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,540
- Stockbrokers in Long Island? - Yeah.

395
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:50,340
It's in Long Island. So what?

396
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:12,190
Hey, I'm looking for Investor's Center.

397
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,110
What's that? You want to invest?

398
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:18,280
No. Investor's Center. I'm looking for Investor's Center.

399
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:22,040
Yeah, yeah, that's us. Hey. This is it. This is it.

400
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,660
- I'm Dwayne. - You're Dwayne?

401
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,750
Hi, Dwayne. We spoke on the phone.

402
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:27,290
I'm Jordan Belfort.

403
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,630
I'm the broker from Rothschild in New York.

404
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,800
Yes, yeah. Have a seat. How are you?

405
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,000
We had a conversation...

406
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:34,340
We spoke on the phone earlier, right?

407
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,760
- Two hours ago. - Right.

408
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,840
Yeah.

409
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:40,970
They're up and comers. That's what that means.

410
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,890
It's three cents a share, that's $3!

411
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:44,430
You cheap fuck!

412
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:46,390
So...

413
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,440
So where are your Quotrons here?

414
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,400
- Quotrons? - Yeah. Your computers.

415
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,770
No, no. We don't even need computers here.

416
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,570
We just trade right off the pink sheets here.

417
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,490
- Pink sheets? - Yeah, they're penny stocks.

418
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:58,410
You know, companies that can't get listed on NASDAQ,

420
00:17:58,490 --> 00:17:59,660
they don't have enough capital?

421
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:00,870
Their shares trade here.

422
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,660
- Penny stocks? - Yeah.

423
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:05,620
This one, Aerodyne, is a really interesting...

424
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,080
Or Aerotyne...

425
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,620
Aerotyne, yeah.

426
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,330
Aero... Aerotyne...

427
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,790
Aerotyne. Yeah.

428
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,000
Very hot stock right now.

429
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:14,090
Oh, yeah?

430
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:15,420
They're just a couple of brothers that are making

431
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:16,800
radar detectors out of their garage.

432
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,920
They're out in Dubuque.

433
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:19,260
Maybe it's microwaves. I'm not sure.

434
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,760
But you call the company's main line,

435
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,640
their mom, Dorothy, answers and she is so sweet.

436
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,640
- Good company. - I actually don't know what else to...

437
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,310
I don't know anything else about them other than that.

438
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:28,940
Six cents a share?

439
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:31,980
Hey, come on. Who buys this crap?

440
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:34,610
Well, I mean... Honestly, mostly schmucks.

441
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:36,690
Postmen, there's always postmen.

442
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,700
Plumbers.

443
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,020
They see our ads in the back of

444
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,820
Hustler and Popular Mechanics.

445
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:44,740
Our ads actually say they can get rich quick.

446
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:46,040
- Hustler? - Yeah.

447
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,330
You know, those girlie magazines.

448
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:48,870
Yeah, yeah. Nudie mag.

449
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,080
A lot.

450
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:51,790
We're helping them finance houses,

451
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,790
we're helping them buy their wife a diamond ring...

452
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,920
a boat maybe.

453
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:57,880
Is this... Is this stuff regulated or are you guys...

454
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,050
What are you doing here?

455
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,930
Sort of.

456
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,220
Sort of?

457
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:08,480
Jesus Christ, the spread on these is huge.

458
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,810
Yeah. And that's the point, that's...

459
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:10,980
What's your name again?

460
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,400
Mine... Jordan Belfort.

461
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,310
Jordan, what do you get on that blue chip stock?

462
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,400
I make one percent. Or I did make one percent.

463
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,320
Pink sheets, it's 50.

464
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,570
50%
It's 50%?

465
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:25,780
50% commission?

466
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,580
- Yup. - For what?

467
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:29,790
It's our markup for our services.

468
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,580
And so if I... If I...

469
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,860
If I sell a stock at $10,000,

470
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,710
my commission is 5,000 bucks?

471
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:39,340
If you sell $10,000 worth of this stock,

472
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:42,010
I will personally give you a blowjob for free.

473
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,470
And I hope it happens.

474
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:49,100
Hello, John, how are you doing today?

475
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,810
You mailed in my company a postcard a few weeks back

476
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:54,000
requesting information on penny stocks that had

477
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,480
huge upside potential with very little downside risk.

478
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:58,080
Does that ring a bell?

479
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,480
Yeah, I may have sent something.

480
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:02,700
Okay, great. The reason for the call today, John, is,

481
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:05,450
something just came across my desk, John.

482
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:08,540
It is perhaps the best thing I've seen in the last six months.

483
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,640
If you have 60 seconds,

484
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,540
I'd like to share the idea with you. You got a minute?

485
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:12,620
Actually, I'm really very...

486
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:15,170
The name of the company, Aerotyne International.

487
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:18,500
It is a cutting edge high-tech firm out of the Midwest

489
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,510
awaiting imminent patent approval

490
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:23,130
on the next generation of radar detectors

491
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,760
that have both huge military

492
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,640
and civilian applications now.

493
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,010
Right now, John,

494
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,560
the stock trades over-the-counter at 10 cents a share.

495
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,020
And by the way, John, our analysts indicate

496
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,400
it could go a heck of a lot higher than that.

497
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,050
Your profit on a mere $6,000 investment

498
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:42,440
would be upwards of $60,000!

499
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,070
Jesus! That's my mortgage, man.

500
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,740
Exactly. You could pay off your mortgage.

501
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,320
This stock will pay off my house?

502
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:49,010
John, one thing I can promise you,

503
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:50,490
even in this market,

504
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,310
is that I never ask my clients

505
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,970
to judge me on my winners.

506
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:56,180
I ask them to judge me on my losers

507
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,750
because I have so few.

508
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,420
And in the case of Aerotyne,

509
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,130
based on every technical factor out there, John,

510
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:05,340
we are looking at a grand slam home run.

511
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,300
Okay, let's do it. I'll do four grand.

512
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:10,600
$4,000? That'd be 40,000 shares, John.

513
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,140
Let me lock in that trade right now

514
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,520
and get back to you with my secretary

515
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,520
with an exact confirmation. Sound good, John?

516
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,850
- Yeah, sounds good. - Great.

517
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,100
Hey, John.

518
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:20,230
Thank you for your vote of confidence.

519
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,730
And welcome to the Investor's Center.

520
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:22,940
Yeah, thanks a lot, man.

521
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,320
Bye-bye.

522
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,370
How'd you fucking do that?

523
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:34,120
Just like that, I made two grand.

524
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,650
The other guys looked at me

525
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:36,960
like I'd just discovered fire.

526
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,790
Great! Even better!

528
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,220
I was selling garbage to garbage men

529
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,550
and making cash hand over fist.

530
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,870
The only problem you're gonna have

531
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,170
is that you didn't buy more.

532
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,890
- So I was selling them shit. - Way to go.

533
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,680
But the way I looked at it,

534
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,720
their money was better off in my pocket.

535
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:55,640
I knew how to spend it better.

536
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,400
Excuse me. Is that your car in the lot?

537
00:21:58,730 --> 00:21:59,900
Yeah.

538
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,940
- It's a nice ride. - Thanks, man.

539
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:03,230
Donnie Azoff.

540
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,360
Hey. I'm Jordan Belfort.

541
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,740
- Nice to meet you. - How you doing?

542
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,650
You know, actually, I see that car around.

543
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,410
- I see it around a lot. - Oh, yeah, where?

544
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:11,280
I think we live in the same building.

545
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:12,450
- No shit? - Yeah, yeah.

546
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,240
- Twelfth floor? - Yeah. What floor are you on?

547
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:15,450
Fourth floor.

548
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,370
- I have two little kids. Ugly wife. - Right.

549
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:20,420
What do you do, bro?

550
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,380
What do you mean, what do I do?

551
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,670
For work, what do you do?

552
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,920
I'm a stockbroker.

553
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:27,760
- Stockbroker? - Yeah.

554
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,430
Children's furniture.

555
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,800
Oh, good for you.

556
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:32,260
It's all right.

557
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,810
You make a lot of money?

558
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,930
Yeah, I do all right for myself.

559
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,270
I'm trying to put it together.

560
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:39,660
You got your fucking nice car,

561
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,310
we live in the same building. I just...

562
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,980
I'm not understanding... How much money do you make?

563
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,860
I don't know. $70,000 last month.

564
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,740
Get the fuck...

565
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:51,610
Get the fuck out of here.

566
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:52,950
No, I'm serious.

567
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,280
Yeah, no, I'm serious, too.

568
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,410
Seriously, how much money do you make?

569
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,790
I told you. $70,000.

570
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,420
Well, technically, $72,000.

571
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,460
Last month. Something like that.

572
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,550
You made 72 grand in one month?

573
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:07,800
Yeah.

574
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,470
I'll tell you what.

575
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:16,720
You show me a pay stub for $72,000 on it,

576
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:19,140
I quit my job right now and I work for you.

577
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,480
Hey, Paulie, what's up?

578
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:29,900
No, yeah, yeah. No, everything's fine.

579
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:31,400
Hey, listen, I quit.

580
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,360
And he did quit his job.

581
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:34,930
Which I thought was a little weird.

582
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:36,410
I mean, I just met this fucking guy.

583
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,370
Don't fucking tell Susan. It's none of her business.

584
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,790
There were other things about him, too.

585
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:42,000
Like his phosphorescent white teeth.

586
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,250
Wife! I gotta fucking deal with your wife?

587
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:45,500
The fact that he wore horn rims with clear lenses

588
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,550
just to look more WASP-y.

590
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:50,510
And then, there were these rumors.

591
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:53,220
I heard some stupid shit. I don't know.

592
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,760
Fuck, I didn't even want to bring it up. It's just...

593
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:57,640
- It's stupid. - Shit with me?

594
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,890
You know, people say shit. I don't even know.

595
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,390
I don't even listen to it half the time.

596
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,060
What are they saying?

597
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,610
Shit about you and your cousin or something like that.

598
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:08,900
I don't even listen to it.

599
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:11,530
Bro, it's not like that.

600
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,070
It's not like that.

601
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,870
Like you married your cousin or some stupid shit. No?

602
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:17,950
Yeah, my wife. Yeah.

603
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,790
My wife is my cousin, or whatever.

604
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:22,500
But it's not like what you think, or whatever, you know.

605
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,540
Is she like a first cousin, or is she...

606
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:25,880
Yeah, no, she's, you know...

607
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,920
Her... Her father

608
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,670
is the brother of my mom.

609
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,380
It's not like, what... You know.

610
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:34,010
Look, we grew up together.

611
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:36,470
And she grew up hot, you know. She fucking grew up hot.

612
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:38,300
And all my friends were trying to fuck her, you know.

613
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:40,270
And I'm not gonna let someone...

614
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:41,930
You know, one of these assholes fuck my cousin,

615
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:45,480
so, you know, I used the cousin thing as like an in with her.

616
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,060
I'm not gonna let someone else fuck my cousin.

617
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:49,820
You know, if anyone's gonna fuck my cousin,

618
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,780
it's gonna be me, out of respect. You know?

619
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:52,990
No, I get it. Yeah.

620
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:55,240
I mean, you're not afraid of like the whole kid thing, right?

621
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,530
- What? Having kids with her? - Yeah.

622
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,820
No. We have two kids.

623
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,370
And they're... I mean...

624
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:02,040
I don't want to get personal, but they're okay?

625
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,250
No, they're not retarded or anything like that.

626
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,250
But there's a big chance, right, if...

627
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:08,670
Yeah, there's like a 60%, you know,

628
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:12,260
60% to 65% chance the kid's gonna be fucking retarded or whatever.

629
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:13,420
That'd scare the shit out of me, buddy.

630
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:15,840
Look, man, a lot of having a kid, or whatever, takes risk,

631
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:17,680
whether you're fucking cousins or not.

632
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,510
What if something like that happened?

633
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,180
Basically, you know, if the kid was retarded,

634
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:25,560
I would, you know, drive it up to the country

635
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,310
and just, like, you know, open the door and say,

636
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,610
"You're free now." You know, like, "Run free."

637
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,190
You know?

638
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,950
You're completely fucking with me.

639
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,950
That's horrible. You're not gonna...

640
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,620
You look like you've... No.

641
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,540
We would take it to, like, an institution or somewhere

642
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:48,420
that's handled to, like, you know, raise the kid or whatever.

643
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,040
You know what? If you're happy, God bless you, buddy.

644
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:51,860
No, I'm not fucking happy. No one who's married is fucking happy.

645
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:54,460
No one who's married is fucking happy.

646
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:56,300
Well, I'm sorry to hear that, buddy.

647
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:58,380
Listen, I'm really, you know...

648
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:00,800
I'm really appreciative for this fucking job.

649
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:02,060
I'm really enjoying it.

650
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,560
I'm really happy with what you're doing.

651
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,930
Actually, I got you a little present.

652
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,440
- You got me a present? - I got you something.

653
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,810
Oh, fuck. You're sweet.

654
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,150
Yeah. It's in the back though.

655
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,610
- What do you mean? - You gotta go out back.

656
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:14,980
Like it's wrapped up or something?

657
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,570
It's wrapped up. Yeah.

658
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:17,780
- I don't get it. - Neither do I.

659
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,320
Let's fucking go. Come on.

660
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:21,570
Your turn.

661
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,740
I'm not fucking doing this. You're out of your fucking mind.

662
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:25,790
- Smoke this shit, bro. - No.

663
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:27,870
No one's fucking here, bro.

664
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,000
Get the fuck...

665
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,880
Fucking smoke crack with me, bro.

666
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,090
I'm not fucking doing it.

667
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:34,880
Smoke crack. Smoke some fucking crack with me, bro.

668
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,340
- One hit. One hit. That's it. - Okay.

669
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,340
Fucking nut job.

670
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,870
Let's go run, huh?

671
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:14,090
We gotta get out of here, buddy.

672
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,960
We gotta get out of here. Let's go fucking run.

673
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:20,470
Let's run like we're fucking lions and tigers and bears!

674
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,050
Let's run! Let's fucking run!

675
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:25,140
Let's fucking run! Go!

676
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,600
Go, go, go, go!

677
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:30,060
You've reached Frank's Best Auto Body.

678
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,640
We're closed right now.

679
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:33,730
So please leave us a message.

680
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:35,480
Hello. My name is Jordan Belfort.

681
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:38,990
My partner and I are very interested in renting out your garage.

682
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:41,530
Donnie and I were going out on our own.

683
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:43,950
And the first thing we needed was brokers.

684
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:45,950
Guys with sales experience.

685
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,950
So I recruited some of my hometown boys.

686
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:51,210
Sea Otter, who sold meat and weed.

687
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:54,670
Chester, who sold tires and weed.

688
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:57,590
And Robbie, who sold anything he could get his hands on.

689
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,960
Mostly weed.

690
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:01,590
Can you bring me some ketchup? Okay?

691
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:03,090
This is Brad.

692
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,840
And Brad's the guy I really wanted.

693
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:06,180
But he didn't go along with us.

694
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:08,810
He was already making so much money selling Quaaludes,

695
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:11,640
he'd become the Quaalude king of Bayside.

696
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:12,810
Getting any pussy with that thing or what?

697
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:13,850
Yeah, man, of course.

698
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:15,860
Bring some of them chicks around here sometime, huh?

699
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,190
Let 'em watch.

700
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:19,110
Let 'em watch. Know what I mean?

701
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:23,200
Hey, Zip! You tell your sister I was asking about her.

702
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:24,770
Why don't you bring me a pair of her panties

703
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:26,450
next time you come through.

704
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:29,370
Yeah, man. She said she don't want to talk to you anymore, man.

705
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:30,660
Get the fuck out of here.

706
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,960
Hey, Ma, we got chicken or what?

707
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,000
Ma!

708
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:38,670
You listening? It's easier than you think.

709
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,210
Every person you're on the phone with,

710
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,800
they want to get rich and they want to get rich quickly.

711
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,050
They all want something for nothing.

712
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:45,000
There was this one time

713
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:46,590
that I was selling pot to this Amish dude.

715
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,050
You know those guys who got like the beard

716
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,180
with like no mustache or some bullshit?

717
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:54,140
Well, he says that he only wants to make furniture.

718
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:56,980
- I don't understand. - What's that got to do with anything?

719
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:58,940
What the fuck are you talking about?

720
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:00,900
I'm not putting words in your mouth or nothing,

721
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:04,150
but you just said that everybody wants to get rich.

722
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,660
Holy fuck, you did just say that.

723
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,080
What the fuck are you talking about?

724
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,240
Yeah, like Buddhists. They don't give a shit about money.

725
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:13,330
They're wrapped in sheets. They're not buying shit.

726
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:15,160
I'm not talking about Buddhists or Amish.

727
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:18,000
I'm talking about normal people, working-class, everyday people.

728
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,000
Everyone wants to get rich. Am I crazy?

729
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:21,380
There's no such thing as an Amish Buddhist.

730
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,340
- I'm pretty fucking sure. - There could be.

731
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,680
Can we get some ketchup, please?

732
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,140
Do you guys not want to make money?

733
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,970
I want to make some money.

734
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:30,350
I want to make some fucking money, okay.

735
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:31,760
I can sell anything.

736
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:33,770
Shit, I can sell ludes to a convent full of nuns,

737
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:35,770
and get them so horny they'd be fucking each other.

738
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:37,690
That's the attitude. You can sell anything?

739
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:39,360
Sell me this fucking pen right here.

740
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,110
You can sell anything. Sell that. Go ahead.

741
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:42,360
Sell me the pen.

742
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:45,150
Can I finish eating first? I haven't eaten today.

743
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,610
Brad, show them how it's done. Boom.

744
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,200
Sell me that pen. Watch. Go on.

745
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,830
You want me to sell this fucking pen?

746
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:53,410
That's my boy right there. Can fucking sell anything.

747
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,500
Why don't you do me a favor.

748
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:56,250
Write your name down on that napkin for me.

749
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:57,370
I don't have a pen.

750
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,170
Exactly. Supply and demand, my friend.

751
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:00,330
- Holy shit. - See what I'm saying?

752
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,790
He's creating urgency.

753
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,340
Get them to want to buy the stock.

754
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:05,300
Convince them it's something they need, you know what I mean?

755
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,550
And that's the thing.

756
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:08,130
All nuns are lesbians.

757
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,140
What the fuck are you talking about, Otter?

758
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:11,180
Think about it. They can't keep a dude

759
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,010
so they're gonna start fucking chicks.

760
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,220
Four fucking times, Kimmie! Four times.

761
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:16,770
He's not with us.

762
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:18,190
Now she runs.

763
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:21,150
But look. I knew these guys weren't like Harvard MBAs.

764
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:22,930
Robbie Feinberg, the pinhead,

765
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:25,150
took five years to finish high school.

766
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,150
Alden Kupferberg, the Sea Otter, didn't even graduate.

767
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:30,630
Chester Ming, the depraved Chinaman,

768
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,490
thought jujitsu was in Israel.

769
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,040
Smartest of the bunch was Nicky Koskoff.

770
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,790
He actually went to law school.

771
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:40,290
I called him Rugrat because of his piece of shit hairpiece.

772
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:44,210
Still, give them to me young, hungry and stupid,

773
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:47,340
and in no time, I'll make them rich.

774
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:50,590
Oh, my God.

775
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:52,140
Jordan, that...

776
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,550
You like it, baby?

777
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,390
Oh, my God, that's beautiful.

778
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,890
They're not the biggest stones in the world,

779
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,730
but I promise they're really high quality.

780
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:01,190
It's beautiful.

781
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,190
They're so beautiful.

782
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:04,770
Oh, boy.

783
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,280
What?

784
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,860
I know that look. What is it? Go ahead.

785
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,610
I don't know, it's... You know...

786
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,490
These stocks... These companies...

787
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:15,620
They're like crappy companies.

788
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,990
- Well, yeah. - Okay.

789
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,450
Yeah, they're terrible.

790
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:20,630
Don't worry about it. I told you,

791
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:22,000
what I'm doing is completely legal.

792
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,170
Yeah, I know.

793
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:25,380
But they're not gonna make anyone money though, right?

794
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,260
Well, sometimes they do, sometimes they don't.

795
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:29,760
You know how it goes.

796
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:32,390
Wouldn't you feel better if you sold that stuff to rich people

797
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:35,430
who can, like, afford to lose all that money?

798
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,640
Of course.

799
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:40,850
But rich people don't buy penny stocks.

800
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,810
They just don't.

801
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:44,480
Why not?

802
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,650
Because they're too smart, that's why not.

803
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:52,740
I mean, what person with a college education

804
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:53,920
would trust this bunch of jerk-offs?

805
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,410
Hang up the phone. Tell him you'll call him back.

806
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:56,580
I got five fucking grand on the phone right now!

807
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:00,750
But what if they didn't sound like a bunch of jerk-offs?

808
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:04,080
What if I could teach them how to sell to people with money?

809
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:05,670
Real money.

810
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,920
So I decided to reinvent the company.

811
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:13,510
Gentlemen, welcome to Stratton Oakmont.

812
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:18,680
You schnooks will now be targeting the wealthiest 1% of Americans.

813
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,810
We're talking about whales here.

814
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:22,770
Moby fucking Dicks.

816
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:27,060
And with this script, which is now your new harpoon,

817
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:29,230
I'm gonna teach each and every one of you

818
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,990
to be Captain fucking Ahab.

819
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,700
Get it? Huh?

820
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,160
Captain who?

821
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,660
Captain Ahab. From the fucking...

822
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:40,330
The book, motherfucker. From the book.

823
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:42,410
Turn your fucking brain on.

824
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,000
- Fuck you. - Jesus fuck, Robbie.

825
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,920
Listen to me. We're a new company with a new name.

826
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,170
A company that our clients can believe in.

827
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:53,170
A company that our clients can trust.

828
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:57,800
A firm whose roots are so deeply embedded into Wall Street

830
00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:01,310
that our very founders sailed over on the Mayflower

831
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:03,230
and chiseled the name Stratton Oakmont

832
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:05,600
right into Plymouth fucking Rock!

834
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:06,980
You got it?

835
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,230
What we're gonna do is this.

836
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:13,250
First we pitch 'em Disney, ATT, IBM,

838
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:14,490
blue chip stocks exclusively.

839
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:16,740
Companies these people know.

840
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:20,870
Once we've suckered them in, we unload the dog shit.

841
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:24,660
The pink sheets, the penny stocks, where we make the money.

842
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,920
50% commission, baby.

843
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:30,000
Now the key to making money in a situation like this

844
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:33,090
is to position yourself now before the settlement.

845
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:36,090
Because by the time you read about it in The Wall Street Journal,

846
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,050
it's already too late.

847
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,260
Then you wait.

848
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,430
You wait.

849
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,100
And whoever speaks first loses.

850
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,350
Sorry...

851
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,940
I appreciate the call.

852
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,680
I really have to give this some thought

853
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:53,230
and talk to my wife about it.

854
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,650
Can I call you back?

855
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:56,030
They don't know, right? They gotta think about it,

856
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,520
they gotta talk to their fucking wives,

857
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,490
or the fucking Tooth Fairy.

859
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:00,370
Point is, it doesn't matter what the fuck they say.

860
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:01,810
The only real objection that they have

861
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:03,950
is that they don't trust you guys.

863
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,660
And why should they trust you? I mean, look at you.

864
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:07,500
You're a bunch of fucking sleazy salesmen, right?

865
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:10,290
So, what do you say?

866
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:13,550
You mean to tell me that if I put you in at Union Carbide at seven

867
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:15,050
and took you out at 32.

868
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:17,720
Texas Instruments at 11 and took you out at 47.

869
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,260
U.S. Steel at 16, took you out at 41.

870
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:21,130
You wouldn't be saying to me right now,

871
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:23,890
"Chester, pick me up a few thousand shares of Disney!"

872
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:26,100
"On the spot, right now. Come on."

873
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,520
Honestly, Kevin? Honestly? Seriously?

874
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,940
I don't know you.

875
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:31,310
You cold-called me. You're a total stranger.

876
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,860
I am in complete agreement with you.

877
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:34,230
You don't know me, I don't know you.

878
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,940
Let me introduce myself to you. My name is Alden Kupferberg.

879
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:38,360
- Robbie Feinberg. - Chester Ming.

880
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:40,280
I'm Senior Vice President at Stratton Oakmont,

881
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:41,780
and I plan on being one of the...

882
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:44,160
top brokers in my firm next year.

883
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,160
And I'm not gonna get there by being wrong, Stanley.

884
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:48,250
I do wanna say that you sound like a...

885
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:50,080
You sound like a pretty sincere guy.

886
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:52,420
It's not gonna make you rich and it's not gonna make you poor.

887
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,960
But what this trade will do is serve as...

888
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:57,300
a benchmark for future business, Kevin.

889
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,220
You feel comfortable with me now, Scotty?

890
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,590
And then you'll know for sure

891
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,720
that you finally found a broker on Wall Street

892
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,350
that you can trust,

893
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:08,020
and who can consistently make you money.

894
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:09,520
Sound fair enough?

895
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:13,520
You know what... Yeah.

896
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,480
I gotta say, I'm pretty impressed.

897
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:19,320
What are you thinking?

898
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,490
Kevin.

899
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:22,950
You give me one shot here

900
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:25,660
on a blue chip stock like Kodak,

901
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,950
and believe me, Kevin,

902
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,540
the only problem you're gonna have

903
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:33,040
is that you didn't buy more.

904
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:34,710
Sound fair enough?

905
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:37,250
Shit. My...

906
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,800
My wife might divorce me, but...

907
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:44,050
Yeah, let's do it.

908
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,140
Excellent choice, Kevin.

909
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,060
How much do you want to go for this time?

910
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,100
Let's do five... $5,000.

911
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,350
Can we try 8,000, Kevin?

912
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,770
All right. Let's do 10.

913
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:55,150
- Ten. - You want to do that?

914
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:56,230
Excellent choice!

915
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,460
Kevin, let me lock in that trade right now,

916
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,110
and get back to you in a few minutes

917
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,490
with an exact confirmation, Kevin.

918
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:03,160
And welcome to Stratton Oakmont.

919
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,410
Thanks, man. I'm gonna have a beer.

920
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,620
This is fun.

921
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:07,910
Take it easy, Kev.

922
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,910
Hey, thanks, Jordan. Thanks a...

923
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,580
Fuck that motherfucker!

924
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:14,540
That's what I'm talking about!

925
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,300
What a fucking idiot.

926
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:22,840
The one thing I know about in this world is airlines.

927
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:26,300
And Cuchon Airlines is the future of airlines.

928
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:27,510
Get in now or...

929
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,350
- I'm Nicky Koskoff. - Chester Ming.

930
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:31,930
and I'm a Senior Vice President with Stratton Oakmont.

931
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:36,150
Judy, I am so, so, so sorry for your loss.

932
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:37,690
When did he pass?

933
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:38,770
Just say I'm wrong, right.

934
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:39,900
And the stock goes down a couple points...

935
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:41,490
And it makes you, in the words of my grandfather,

936
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:44,360
God rest his soul, "A shit ton of money."

937
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:45,570
It's like getting in on fucking sunlight

938
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,280
before there was fucking sunlight. You understand?

939
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:49,120
Can we do 8,000 shares?

940
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,660
Okay, 25,000.

941
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,790
That's a very intelligent decision.

942
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:55,500
I'm gonna transfer you to my sales associate.

943
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,460
Rhonda!

944
00:36:58,170 --> 00:36:59,460
- Rhonda! - I'm gonna put you through to Andrea.

945
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,170
Has anybody fucking seen Rhonda?

946
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,050
Everybody have a good week?

947
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,180
Yeah!

948
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,680
The end of the month.

949
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:16,190
$28.7 million in gross commissions,

950
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:19,570
all from pink sheet stock, boys!

951
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,900
And to celebrate with our weekly act of debauchery,

952
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:25,740
I have offered our lovely sales assistant,

953
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,740
Danielle Harrison, here,

954
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:31,580
$10,000 to shave her fucking head!

955
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,330
Yeah, you want this?

956
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,500
You want this?

957
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:40,000
Let's scalp her! Scalp her!

958
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:42,420
Let the scalping begin!

959
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,470
Scalp! Scalp! Scalp!

960
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:51,900
FYI, boys, Danielle has promised to

961
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,680
use this $10,000 for breast implants!

962
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:58,190
She's already got C cups, but now she wants fucking double D's!

963
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:01,020
Is this a great fucking company or what?

964
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:06,240
Is this the greatest company in the world?

965
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,660
Donnie!

966
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:14,200
Blow the roof off this motherfucker!

967
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,440
Champagne?

968
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:50,820
Send in the stripees!

969
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:26,280
Mine!

970
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:44,960
Word about us spread throughout Wall Street.

971
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:47,340
Even the places I didn't want it to.

973
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,020
It wasn't long before Forbes magazine,

974
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:01,890
the flagship of Wall Street, called to do a profile on me.

975
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:05,270
Let me ask you, how do you see the future for Stratton Oakmont?

976
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,520
One word?

977
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:10,740
Diversification.

978
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:12,110
Sounds good. Thank you so much. I have more than enough.

979
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,200
- I appreciate your time. - Fantastic.

980
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,280
Can we get a quick picture?

981
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,870
A total fucking hatchet job.

984
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:21,120
This conniving little twat! Look at this!

986
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:24,370
"The Wolf of Wall Street" They call me. Look.

987
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,420
Your hair looks good.

989
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,920
- Well, my hair looks good. - Yeah.

990
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:31,130
"Jordan Belfort, sounding like a kind of twisted Robin Hood"

991
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,840
"who takes from the rich and gives to himself,"

992
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:35,720
"and his merry little band of brokers."

993
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,640
- Read that. Read it. - Listen.

994
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:41,100
There is no such thing as bad publicity, sweetheart.

995
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:42,680
Read the article, babe.

996
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:45,230
Jordan, you look great! You're in a huge magazine.

997
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,900
Big fucking deal I look great.

998
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:49,530
Mr. Belfort! Can you look at my resume, please?

999
00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:51,530
Excuse me, excuse me, sir!

1000
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:55,410
Calm the fuck down!

1001
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:57,280
What the hell's all this?

1002
00:40:57,490 --> 00:40:58,730
It's the Forbes article.

1003
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,200
They all want to work for you now.

1004
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:01,450
Hey! What did I say?

1005
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:02,700
I'm just trying to be nice.

1006
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,620
Hey, you want a job, you talk to me!

1007
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
- Mr. Belfort! - Give me one minute.

1008
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:09,710
Forbes made me a superstar.

1009
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,780
Every day, dozens of money-crazed kids

1010
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:15,760
beat a path to my door.

1011
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,760
If we hired 'em, they dropped straight out of college overnight

1012
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:21,390
and spent whatever allowance they had

1013
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:23,980
on a new suit from our Stratton tailor.

1014
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:25,600
Are you fucking serious right now?

1018
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:29,770
I mean, we were literally putting clothes on these kids' backs.

1019
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:32,860
And here comes this jerk-off sniffing around.

1020
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:36,110
But, you know, every time someone rises up in this world,

1021
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:39,580
there's always gonna be some asshole trying to drag him down.

1022
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:42,860
Within months, we doubled in size,

1023
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:44,910
moved to even bigger offices.

1024
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:53,590
It was a madhouse.

1025
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:55,260
A greed-fest,

1026
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:59,260
with equal parts cocaine, testosterone, and body fluids.

1027
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:05,430
It got so bad, I had to declare the office a fuck-free zone

1028
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,440
between the hours of 9:00 and 7:00.

1029
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,190
But I'm telling you, even that didn't help.

1030
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:13,320
Actually, the madness started on our very first day,

1031
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,860
when one of our brokers, Ben Jenner,

1032
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:17,070
christened the elevator by getting a blowjob

1033
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,700
from a sales assistant.

1034
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,660
Her name was Pam, and to her credit,

1035
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:23,230
she did have this amazing technique,

1036
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:25,790
with this wild twist and jerk motion.

1037
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,290
About a month later,

1038
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:29,290
Donnie and I decided to double-team her

1039
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,240
on a Saturday afternoon while our wives were out

1040
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,380
shopping for Christmas dresses.

1041
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,050
Eventually, Ben married her,

1042
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:36,090
which was pretty amazing

1043
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:39,970
considering she blew every single guy in the office.

1044
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:43,310
Then he got depressed and killed himself three years later.

1045
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:47,850
Anyway, I hired my dad, Max, to maintain order as the Enforcer.

1046
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,600
Stratton's very own Gestapo.

1047
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:54,480
We called him Mad Max because of his hair-trigger temper,

1048
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:55,950
which could be set off by

1049
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:58,490
something as innocuous as a ringing telephone.

1050
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,280
Who the fuck has the goddamn gall

1051
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:04,990
to call this house on a Tuesday night?

1052
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:07,250
God damn it!

1053
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:08,370
You're gonna miss it!

1054
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,290
Please, tell me something I don't know.

1055
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:13,130
I wait all week for the fucking Equalizer

1056
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:15,500
and they have to fucking... Hello.

1057
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:17,300
But as soon as he picked up the phone...

1058
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:18,670
Gene. How are you, Gene?

1059
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,720
... he'd affect this weird British accent.

1060
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,010
Right-o, Gene, that'd be great.

1061
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:24,300
Cheerio.

1062
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:25,430
It was absolutely bizarre.

1063
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,060
The fucking halfwit!

1064
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:28,180
- He'd hang up... - You missed it!

1065
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:30,520
... and then he's Mad Max all over again.

1066
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:31,650
Damn it!

1067
00:43:31,770 --> 00:43:33,940
All right, tell me what happened. What happened?

1068
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:36,150
Well, he discovered it was the mother's sister.

1069
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:37,650
Who's he? Who? Tell me who...

1070
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,320
The main guy. You know who the main...

1071
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:40,490
The main guy...

1072
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:42,910
It was his mother's sister. She showed up dead.

1073
00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:45,950
Of course, Mad Max didn't have to know

1074
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,700
everything we were doing at Stratton.

1075
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:49,830
And then there's a big target and we...

1076
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,870
They get launched at the target. They stick.

1077
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,080
There's a bull's-eye and the bull's-eye's a dollar sign.

1078
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:55,250
Whoever gets closer to the dollar sign

1079
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:56,300
gets the most points.

1080
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:58,590
I'm gonna throw the shit out of this little fucking thing.

1081
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:00,590
So if it gets hurt, what happens?

1082
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:01,970
'Cause we're gonna get fucking nuts.

1083
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:03,300
I don't think he's gonna get hurt. They're like...

1084
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:05,140
They got like superhuman strength.

1085
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:06,430
I think he's gonna be fine.

1086
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:08,470
You can't look him right in the eyes.

1087
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,680
You can't look him in the eye?

1088
00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:11,440
That's a fact. I saw it on PBS.

1089
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,400
They get confused and their wires get crossed.

1090
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:15,020
You gotta look at their chin.

1091
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:16,150
Like it looks like I'm looking at you

1092
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:17,230
but I'm looking at your chin.

1093
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,010
I feel like you're addressing me right now,

1094
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:19,480
but you're not, are you?

1095
00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:21,450
They're like the Mona Lisa. They find eye contact,

1096
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:23,070
like, wherever you are standing in the room.

1097
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:24,360
And they lock in.

1098
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:27,080
No, but there is a limit to what we can do with them?

1099
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,290
We're allowed to throw shit at 'em.

1100
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:29,790
We're allowed to throw food? Bananas.

1101
00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:31,330
Any food. Correct.

1102
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:32,460
But, for example, what I wouldn't do is

1103
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:34,290
maybe like tell him to pull his cock out

1104
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,080
and like get some of the girls to, you know,

1105
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:37,250
fondle him and shit like that.

1106
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:38,340
That would be... That's unacceptable?

1107
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:39,420
Let's keep that in our back pocket.

1108
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,510
This guy is more about throwing at the dartboard.

1109
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:42,590
Correct. Yes, yes, yes.

1110
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,050
The thing is, this is their gift, okay.

1111
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:46,180
They're built to be thrown like a lawn dart.

1112
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:47,470
They're top heavy like a lawn dart.

1113
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,560
So they're built for accuracy.

1114
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,600
Oh, my God. Can we bowl with this guy?

1115
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:51,770
That's his fucking brother, Rob.

1116
00:44:51,850 --> 00:44:53,190
His brother's the bowling ball.

1117
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:54,980
The brother, you put a skateboard on him,

1118
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:56,360
you strap him to a skateboard,

1119
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:57,810
you toss him down an alley at some pins.

1120
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:59,520
- No shit. That's interesting. - Swear to fucking God.

1121
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:01,610
- Can we get that guy? - Yeah, we'll get that guy, too.

1122
00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:03,780
But it says here this guy will show his cock. Yeah.

1123
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:05,110
- Instead of growing up. Yeah. - He will?

1124
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,490
They are very ornery by the way,

1125
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:07,950
so you gotta be very careful with these little guys.

1126
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:09,080
Safety first.

1127
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,240
Safety is first, all right?

1128
00:45:10,330 --> 00:45:12,200
I want somebody with a fucking tranquilizer gun

1129
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:13,910
ready to knock this fucker out.

1130
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,170
- Do we want to get like a... - Mace. Taser guns.

1131
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:17,250
A pellet gun maybe?

1132
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:18,460
No, a pellet gun is gonna hurt him.

1133
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:19,880
I just want him out. Knocked out cold.

1134
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:22,550
But I say we stick with the loophole. Right? Okay?

1135
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,550
If we don't consider him a human,

1136
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:26,760
we just consider it an act, I think we're in the clear.

1137
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:27,890
Like The Flying Wallendas.

1138
00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:29,930
You know, a lot of those guys died but they never sued anybody.

1139
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:31,770
The important thing you guys gotta keep in mind

1140
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:33,680
is that these things gossip.

1141
00:45:33,810 --> 00:45:35,390
They get together and they gossip.

1142
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:36,850
- That's a good point. - And the last thing

1143
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:39,110
that we need is them getting together and saying,

1144
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:40,770
"Oh, they made fun of us."

1145
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:42,440
Like, it's gonna make Stratton look bad.

1146
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:44,610
That's why I love you. You think of shit like that.

1147
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,700
When they come in, we treat it just like one of us. Okay?

1148
00:45:47,950 --> 00:45:51,080
One of us. Gooble gobble, one of us.

1149
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,740
We accept them, one of us!

1150
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:54,540
Gooble gobble, one of us.

1151
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:55,960
We accept them, one of us.

1152
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,080
Gooble gobble, one of us!

1153
00:45:57,170 --> 00:45:58,460
Jordan! Your Dad's coming.

1154
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:00,000
Something about the American Express bill.

1155
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:01,250
Can you get him out of here?

1156
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:02,500
Yeah. Lick my twat.

1157
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:03,840
No, I'm serious!

1158
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:06,260
Fuck. Guys, act like we're working.

1159
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:07,800
You got any fucking stock forms?

1160
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:09,430
He's coming, he's coming.

1161
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:10,680
Make some shit up.

1162
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:12,760
I think if we short Pfizer...

1163
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:17,770
$430,000 in one month, Jordy, huh?

1164
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:19,850
Four hundred and fucking

1165
00:46:19,850 --> 00:46:23,190
30,000 fucking dollars in one fucking month!

1166
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,440
Good morning. They're business expenses. Relax.

1167
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:26,740
- Business expenses? - Yes.

1168
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:28,240
- Jordy, look what you got here. - What?

1169
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:32,200
Look at this. $26,000 for one fucking dinner!

1170
00:46:32,370 --> 00:46:33,990
Okay. No, no. This could be explained.

1171
00:46:34,290 --> 00:46:36,500
Dad, we had clients. The Pfizer clients.

1172
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:38,460
Right. The porterhouse from Argentina.

1173
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:40,790
Expensive champagne and... We had to buy champagne.

1174
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,380
And you ordered all the fucking sides.

1175
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:44,420
- Tell him about the sides. - I ordered sides, so...

1176
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:47,970
Sides? $26,000 worth of sides?

1177
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:50,390
What are these sides? They cure cancer?

1178
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:52,350
The sides did cure cancer. That's the problem.

1179
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:53,850
That's why they were expensive.

1180
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:55,850
- Shut the fuck up. - I'm serious.

1181
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:57,930
- Stop. - And EJ Entertainment?

1182
00:46:58,020 --> 00:46:59,810
What the fuck is EJ Entertainment?

1183
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:02,650
Well, that's...

1184
00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:03,820
Yeah, Jordy, what's EJ Entertainment?

1185
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:04,980
How do I describe this?

1186
00:47:05,070 --> 00:47:06,070
Jord, what is that?

1187
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:08,240
- It's a fucking prostitution ring, Jordy! - I know.

1188
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:10,410
- That's what it is! - That is what it is.

1189
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:12,490
Isn't that the perfect description for it?

1190
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:15,160
That is what it is. But none of these were charged to me.

1191
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,580
This is all of them.

1192
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,460
- Oh, that was all us? - It wasn't me though.

1193
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:20,370
Fucking explain this shit to him!

1194
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:23,420
These are all of your fucking charges right here!

1195
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:25,670
The IRS, they allow for T&A. It's fine.

1196
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:26,090
T&E!

1197
00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:28,090
T&E!

1198
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:29,220
Yeah. I said T&E.

1199
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:30,590
- No, no. You said T&A. - No, I didn't.

1200
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:31,680
Yeah, you did.

1201
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:32,950
- When did I say that? - You said T&A.

1202
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:34,050
T&E!

1203
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:35,430
I know you're upset about the dinner,

1204
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:36,980
and that makes sense because

1205
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:38,010
we did spend too much money.

1206
00:47:38,010 --> 00:47:39,810
But I said T&E.

1207
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:41,520
Don't tell me what you said. I heard what you said.

1208
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:42,900
- Dad. He said T&A. - He did?

1209
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:44,360
Absolutely, no question.

1210
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:45,570
I'm trying to...

1211
00:47:45,650 --> 00:47:46,690
I'm getting this close!

1212
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:47,980
- Dad, relax. - I'm getting this close.

1213
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:50,530
That's what I'm saying. I want you to open up more, Max.

1214
00:47:50,610 --> 00:47:51,660
He's gonna fucking kill you.

1215
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:53,280
Why do you hold it in? Why do you...

1216
00:47:53,450 --> 00:47:55,080
Max, why do you hold it in?

1217
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:56,870
That's it. Get the fuck out of here!

1218
00:47:56,990 --> 00:47:59,290
- No, no, no! - Asshole, get out of here.

1219
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:01,460
What kind of hooker takes credit cards?

1220
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:02,580
A rich one.

1221
00:48:02,670 --> 00:48:05,000
At Stratton, there were three kinds of hookers.

1222
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:07,380
The Blue Chips, top of the line, model material.

1223
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:08,960
They cost between $300 and $500

1224
00:48:09,050 --> 00:48:11,840
and you had to wear a condom unless you gave them a hefty tip,

1225
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:13,800
which, of course, I always did.

1226
00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:17,510
Then came the NASDAQs, who were pretty, not great.

1227
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,930
They cost between 200 and 300 bucks.

1228
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:22,480
Finally, there were the Pink Sheets. Skanks.

1229
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,080
They cost about 100 or less.

1230
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:25,480
If you didn't wear a condom,

1231
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:27,020
you'd have to get a penicillin shot the next day

1232
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:29,280
and pray your dick didn't fall off.

1233
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:31,190
Not that we didn't fuck them, too.

1234
00:48:31,490 --> 00:48:33,110
Believe me, we did.

1235
00:48:33,950 --> 00:48:35,990
It's that slipped disc thing again.

1236
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:38,490
I know what it is. You know, too much...

1237
00:48:38,910 --> 00:48:40,330
...with EJ Entertainment.

1238
00:48:40,410 --> 00:48:41,410
Pops.

1239
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:42,830
How are things at home?

1240
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,500
Well, not the best.

1241
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,130
She just doesn't... You know what I'm saying?

1242
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:48,710
It's like the smell...

1243
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,380
There's a smell, there's an attraction thing.

1244
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:53,050
After a while it kind of fades away a little bit.

1245
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:54,800
Yeah, well. It's supposed to fade away.

1246
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,800
- Supposed to? - That's marriage. You know...

1247
00:48:56,930 --> 00:48:59,510
Your mother and I, we've been married a long, long time.

1248
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:00,770
What do you think? We're...

1249
00:49:00,850 --> 00:49:02,680
We're jumping into bed every two minutes?

1250
00:49:02,850 --> 00:49:04,140
- It doesn't work that way. - I love her to death.

1251
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,400
I want to stay married, Dad, but...

1252
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:07,810
It's crazy out there.

1253
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:09,400
Some of these girls... You should see them.

1254
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:10,730
Oh, my God!

1255
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:12,440
They're fucking...

1256
00:49:12,530 --> 00:49:14,400
The things they're doing now, Pops.

1257
00:49:14,530 --> 00:49:16,820
I mean... I mean, it's on a whole other level.

1258
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:18,490
- Really? - And they're all shaved, too.

1259
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:20,040
- Get out of here! - All shaven.

1260
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,540
- Are you kidding me? - Yeah.

1261
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:23,830
- Bald as a china doll. - No bush?

1262
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,920
- No bush. - Oh, my God!

1263
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:27,480
All of a sudden, one week,

1264
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:29,630
nobody had anything down there anymore.

1265
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:30,800
It's a new world.

1266
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,800
They're bald from the eyebrows down.

1267
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,340
Nothing. Not a stitch. It's like lasers.

1268
00:49:35,550 --> 00:49:36,760
Wow. A new world.

1269
00:49:37,390 --> 00:49:39,890
I was born too... too early.

1270
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:42,180
I've never been a fan of the bush, to be honest.

1271
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,600
- Really? - Yeah.

1272
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:44,770
I don't mind it.

1273
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:46,270
Dad.

1274
00:49:46,810 --> 00:49:48,730
I don't want you stressing out about any of this.

1275
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:50,070
How can I not get stressed out?

1276
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:51,520
Look at the knuckleheads you got working for you.

1277
00:49:51,610 --> 00:49:52,820
I know they're knuckleheads

1278
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:55,110
but I need them to want to live like me, you get it?

1279
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:56,570
To live like me.

1280
00:49:56,950 --> 00:49:58,030
Jordy.

1281
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:01,870
One of these days, the chickens are gonna come home to roost.

1282
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:05,660
You're looking at me like I'm crazy.

1283
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:09,130
Crazy? This is obscene.

1284
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:10,750
It was obscene.

1285
00:50:11,090 --> 00:50:12,460
In the normal world.

1286
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,960
But who the fuck wanted to live there?

1287
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:18,800
Go party your fucking cocks off!

1288
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:25,770
We are about to become fucking legends

1289
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:27,730
on Wall Street!

1290
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:32,320
We got plans up here that's gonna take this company

1291
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,360
into the fucking stratosphere!

1292
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:40,120
Wolfie! Wolfie!

1293
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,910
Fuck Merrill Lynch. Fuck them.

1294
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:46,980
Why should they be taking

1295
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:48,540
all our fucking money all the fucking time?

1296
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:49,790
This way we become the underwriters.

1297
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,420
It was our next big move.

1298
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:55,090
Finding companies to take public. IPOs.

1299
00:50:55,170 --> 00:50:56,970
It was the only way these Wall Street pricks

1300
00:50:57,050 --> 00:51:00,760
would ever stop thinking of us as some shitkicker bucket shop.

1301
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:02,050
We got Arncliffe International.

1302
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:03,680
See, we were a little different.

1303
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,100
We liked to get as fucked up as possible

1304
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:07,350
during our business powwows

1305
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,890
in order to stimulate our free-flowing ideas,

1306
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:12,980
which is why we were popping these ludes like they were M&M's.

1307
00:51:13,690 --> 00:51:15,150
Steve Madden.

1308
00:51:16,650 --> 00:51:17,820
We own the fucking companies...

1309
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:19,700
We own the companies...

1310
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:21,700
Don't know what a lude is? I'll tell you.

1311
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:23,830
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1312
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:25,550
Looks like those ludes

1313
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:28,660
are working their magic on Donnie right now.

1314
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:03,450
The Quaalude,

1315
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:06,450
or lude, as it is commonly referred to,

1316
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:09,940
was first synthesized in 1951 by an Indian doctor,

1317
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:11,790
 that's dots, not feathers,

1318
00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:14,600
as a sedative, and was prescribed to

1319
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:17,210
stressed-out housewives with sleep disorders.

1320
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:20,130
But pretty soon someone figured out

1321
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:23,970
that if you resisted the urge to sleep for just 15 minutes,

1322
00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:26,390
you got a pretty kick-ass high from it.

1323
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:30,390
Didn't take long for people to start abusing ludes, of course.

1324
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,650
And in 1982, the U.S. Government Schedule 1'd them.

1325
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:35,900
Along with the rest of the world.

1326
00:52:36,230 --> 00:52:39,280
Which meant there was only a finite amount of these things left.

1327
00:52:39,570 --> 00:52:42,320
No shit, you can't even buy 'em anymore.

1328
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:44,910
You people are all shit out of luck.

1329
00:52:45,070 --> 00:52:46,490
What are you saying? What is it?

1330
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:49,740
Steve Madden.

1331
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,370
Steve.

1332
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:54,120
You remember those ads?

1333
00:52:54,210 --> 00:52:56,580
Those giant-headed girls with the bug eyes

1334
00:52:56,670 --> 00:52:58,290
wearing those big clunky shoes?

1335
00:52:59,090 --> 00:53:00,590
My friend from school, Steve Madden.

1336
00:53:00,670 --> 00:53:02,050
His friend from school, Steve Madden.

1337
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:04,930
Steve Madden was the name in women's shoes at the moment.

1338
00:53:05,010 --> 00:53:08,720
And all of Wall Street was begging to take his company public.

1339
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:10,060
Go ahead, go ahead, what is it?

1340
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:11,430
Except, guess who grew up with him?

1341
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,310
- Women's shoes. - Women's shoes.

1342
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:15,940
My very own Vice President.

1343
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:17,610
Women's shoes!

1344
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:19,770
Diamond Donnie Azoff.

1345
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:22,440
- Steve Madden. - Steve.

1346
00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:23,860
Steve.

1347
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:25,030
Hey, JB, JB, JB, JB.

1348
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:26,280
You gotta come check this fucking chick out.

1349
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:28,120
Look at this. Look.

1350
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:36,080
I would fuck that girl if she was my sister.

1351
00:53:36,170 --> 00:53:38,630
I would let that girl give me fucking AIDS.

1352
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:41,420
You want to see the Wolf handle this?

1353
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:44,880
She's hot.

1354
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:46,720
Cristy.

1355
00:53:51,850 --> 00:53:53,680
Jordan, this is my friend Naomi.

1356
00:53:53,810 --> 00:53:56,350
- Hi. Nice to meet you. - Naomi.

1357
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:57,980
Naomi, nice to meet you.

1358
00:53:58,110 --> 00:53:59,810
You got an awesome place here.

1359
00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:02,230
I've don't think I've ever been in a house this big before.

1360
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:03,480
- Oh, really? - Yeah.

1361
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:04,780
Beautiful beach out there.

1362
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:06,030
Blair Hollingsworth.

1363
00:54:07,070 --> 00:54:08,320
Hi, Blair. Nice to meet you.

1364
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:10,030
- Your name's Blair, right? - Yeah.

1365
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:11,410
You like to Jet Ski?

1366
00:54:11,910 --> 00:54:13,080
I've never done it before.

1367
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:14,160
You've never Jet Ski'd in your life?

1368
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:15,250
No, I've never Jet Ski'd.

1369
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:16,750
You've never been on a Jet Ski?

1370
00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:18,000
How many times are you gonna ask her?

1371
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:19,460
She's never been on a Jet Ski.

1372
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,170
I don't know. Might ask her a couple more times.

1373
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:24,840
Okay. Sure.

1374
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:27,760
Hi. I'm Hildy. Nice to meet you.

1375
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:29,840
Jordan, Teresa needs your help.

1376
00:54:30,050 --> 00:54:31,350
Yeah, I'll be out in a couple of minutes.

1377
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:32,760
Just tell her I'll be out in a couple of minutes.

1378
00:54:32,850 --> 00:54:34,310
Why don't you tell your wife that?

1379
00:54:34,390 --> 00:54:35,390
I might do that, but I'm having

1380
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,020
- a conversation right now. - What am I, your secretary?

1381
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:38,940
You know what, I think we should get going.

1382
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:40,190
Wait, wait. Where you guys going?

1383
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:41,730
We gotta go. We got two other parties to go to.

1384
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:43,480
- We can stay for a drink. - Yeah, stay for a drink.

1385
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:45,860
No. We got two other parties we're supposed to get to.

1386
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:47,110
But we can stay for a drink...

1387
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,360
She's

1388
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:50,200
perfect.

1389
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:51,820
- You like champagne? - I do.

1390
00:54:51,910 --> 00:54:52,950
She's perfect.

1391
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,410
Donnie, what the fuck are you doing?

1392
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,200
You piece of...

1393
00:55:04,130 --> 00:55:06,510
You're gonna have to excuse my friend. He gets...

1394
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:07,970
Get the fuck out!

1395
00:55:08,050 --> 00:55:10,090
Jordan, you gotta fuck her, bro. She's so hot!

1396
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:11,260
Yeah, Donnie!

1397
00:55:12,430 --> 00:55:14,350
Let him fucking finish, Hildy.

1398
00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:16,060
That's fucking rude.

1399
00:55:16,430 --> 00:55:17,980
Have some fucking manners.

1400
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:23,940
So, Bay Ridge, that's near Staten Island, right?

1401
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:26,360
Brooklyn, across the Verrazano Bridge.

1402
00:55:26,610 --> 00:55:28,030
Saturday Night Fever territory.

1403
00:55:28,150 --> 00:55:29,650
That's right. Guinea Gulch.

1404
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:32,030
We call the Verrazano Bridge the Guinea Gangplank.

1405
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,200
Right.

1406
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:34,910
So I presume you're Italian?

1407
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:36,200
On my dad's side.

1408
00:55:36,290 --> 00:55:39,500
I'm also Dutch, German, English.

1409
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,080
I'm a mutt.

1410
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:42,580
Yeah. You're a mutt.

1411
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:45,000
Yeah, I still have family over there though, in London.

1412
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:47,800
My Aunt Emma. She's the best.

1413
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:50,840
Very British, you know. She's a classy lady.

1414
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:52,260
That explains it then.

1415
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:53,340
Explains what?

1416
00:55:53,430 --> 00:55:56,220
It explains you. I mean, you're a duchess, right?

1417
00:55:56,350 --> 00:55:58,730
The Duchess of Bay Ridge.

1418
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:02,850
Excuse me.

1419
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:04,940
Could I get a straw, please?

1420
00:56:06,110 --> 00:56:07,570
Thank you.

1421
00:56:10,570 --> 00:56:15,830
So I was a little surprised you asked Cristy for my number.

1422
00:56:16,910 --> 00:56:18,160
Why is that?

1423
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:21,870
Aren't you married?

1424
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:25,420
Well... Yeah, but what?

1425
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:27,590
Married people can't have friends?

1426
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:31,260
We're gonna be friends?

1427
00:56:32,470 --> 00:56:35,550
Yeah. You don't want to be my friend?

1428
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,730
We're not gonna be friends.

1429
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:52,450
And at night I work on my designs.

1430
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:55,240
I have an entire line of lingerie.

1431
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:58,200
You know, camisoles, bustiers, panties.

1432
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:01,620
She designs women's panties, too?

1433
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:03,410
Oh, my God!

1434
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,390
Come on, Jordan, think of a way to get up to her apartment.

1435
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,980
You wanna come up for some tea or something?

1436
00:57:25,350 --> 00:57:26,940
Tea? Yeah.

1437
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:28,940
- Like hot tea? - Yeah.

1438
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:30,320
Oh, yeah. That sounds nice. Yeah.

1439
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,690
Tea. Fuck, yeah, I wanted to come up for tea.

1440
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:35,740
Like Darjeeling or rose hip, something nice like that?

1441
00:57:35,950 --> 00:57:36,950
Sure.

1442
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:38,370
This is Rocky.

1443
00:57:38,450 --> 00:57:40,660
Oh, who's this? Say hi, Rocky.

1444
00:57:40,910 --> 00:57:41,990
Hi, sweetheart.

1445
00:57:42,290 --> 00:57:43,370
Okay.

1446
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:46,540
Why don't you light a fire or something and I'll be right out.

1447
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:48,920
- Yeah. Fire, here? - Sure.

1448
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:53,880
I like your painting here. It's...

1449
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:03,640
God, help me. How do I fuck this girl?

1450
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:08,270
You all right?

1451
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:10,690
Yeah, yeah. Just trying to light the fire here.

1453
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:17,910
That's it. That's it, you're leaving.

1454
00:58:17,990 --> 00:58:19,870
Don't get involved. Go home to your wife.

1455
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,670
As you can probably guess,

1456
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:34,300
I fucked her goddamn brains out...

1457
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,130
Jesus Lord!

1458
00:58:38,970 --> 00:58:40,600
For 11 seconds.

1459
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:52,980
Did you just come?

1460
00:58:53,110 --> 00:58:55,030
Oh, yeah, I just came.

1461
00:58:56,070 --> 00:58:57,400
Did you? Did you come?

1462
00:58:57,610 --> 00:58:59,200
- No. - No?

1463
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:00,360
Okay.

1464
00:59:00,490 --> 00:59:02,620
I'm still hard so just give me a sec.

1465
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:05,120
Sure.

1466
00:59:05,410 --> 00:59:07,040
Come on, baby, come on.

1467
00:59:09,670 --> 00:59:11,750
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

1468
00:59:17,630 --> 00:59:19,010
Oh, God!

1469
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:21,010
Fuck off, Rocky! Bad dog.

1470
00:59:21,220 --> 00:59:22,510
You have a biscuit or something like that?

1471
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:23,680
It's okay.

1472
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,220
- Just keep going. - Rocky, go play.

1473
00:59:25,310 --> 00:59:27,180
Go play, Rocky. Go, go, go, go.

1474
00:59:29,770 --> 00:59:31,060
You're crazy.

1475
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:32,400
I couldn't get enough.

1476
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:34,820
I mean, her pussy was like heroin to me.

1477
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:37,650
And it wasn't just about the sex, either.

1478
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:39,740
Naomi and I got along. I mean, we...

1479
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:41,660
We had similar interests and shit.

1480
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,620
Choo-choo train.

1481
00:59:57,170 --> 01:00:00,880
I think I can. I think I can. I think I can. I think I can.

1482
01:00:06,890 --> 01:00:10,180
Yeah, yeah. Let's toke it all on there, huh?

1483
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:13,400
Oh, shit!

1484
01:00:23,990 --> 01:00:25,160
You!

1485
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:27,290
Get out of the fucking car!

1486
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:28,700
Jesus Christ.

1487
01:00:28,790 --> 01:00:31,370
Son of a bitch! Oh, fuck!

1488
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:34,460
Relax, sweetheart. Relax.

1489
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:37,250
- Son of a fucking bitch! - Okay, okay... Geez!

1490
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:38,630
Okay, babe, stop!

1491
01:00:38,710 --> 01:00:39,840
Please.

1492
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:41,010
Bitch!

1493
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:43,380
- What are you doing... - That whore from the party?

1494
01:00:43,470 --> 01:00:44,970
Jesus Christ!

1495
01:00:45,050 --> 01:00:46,140
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1496
01:00:46,220 --> 01:00:47,470
I thought you were at the fucking beach!

1497
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:48,890
I didn't know you were here!

1498
01:00:48,970 --> 01:00:50,520
That's where you've fucking been?

1499
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:52,310
With that fucking whore from the party?

1500
01:00:52,390 --> 01:00:53,810
I thought you were at the beach house.

1501
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:55,270
How could you do this to me?

1502
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:56,200
Sweetie, come on...

1503
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:58,150
Who the fuck are you, Jordan?

1504
01:00:58,230 --> 01:01:00,990
You're like a completely different fucking person!

1505
01:01:01,070 --> 01:01:02,900
I made a mistake. I don't know what to tell you,

1506
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:04,200
babe. I...

1507
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:05,910
I'm sorry.

1508
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:08,870
- I'm sorry. - Is that who... is that what you want?

1509
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:20,420
Do you love her?

1510
01:01:26,090 --> 01:01:27,550
Answer me.

1511
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:51,200
I felt horrible.

1512
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:54,040
Three days later, I filed for a divorce

1513
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:55,870
and moved Naomi into the apartment.

1514
01:02:00,460 --> 01:02:03,880
Say what you will, but the Duchess did have style.

1515
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:07,090
She brought in a decorator, feng shui'd the whole place.

1516
01:02:07,180 --> 01:02:09,550
She even hired a gay butler.

1517
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:12,220
This guy was smart, sophisticated, professional.

1518
01:02:12,310 --> 01:02:13,890
Really, really great.

1519
01:02:14,140 --> 01:02:15,310
Is that jasmine?

1520
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:18,310
Yes, sir. I tried to stump you this evening. Very good.

1521
01:02:18,650 --> 01:02:20,270
Very good. Great nose.

1522
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:22,020
Except for that one time.

1523
01:02:27,450 --> 01:02:28,700
Oh, my God!

1524
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:31,660
Oh, hey.

1525
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:33,410
Is it wednesday already?

1526
01:02:34,370 --> 01:02:35,620
Oh, don't stop.

1527
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:36,790
What the fuck!

1528
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:39,000
That is fucked up!

1529
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:40,670
He must have thought we were still

1530
01:02:40,750 --> 01:02:42,340
at the Hamptons this weekend, you know.

1531
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:43,800
Where were they doing it, sweetheart? In the bedroom?

1532
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:44,740
They were everywhere.

1533
01:02:44,740 --> 01:02:46,550
There were two guys over there on the table.

1534
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:47,880
There were more over here.

1535
01:02:47,970 --> 01:02:49,430
There were four right here.

1536
01:02:49,510 --> 01:02:50,900
Are you fucking serious? Right there?

1537
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:52,300
Why didn't you tell me? Sweet.

1538
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:54,100
Oh, baby, it gets worse.

1539
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:58,140
After they left, I checked the apartment.

1540
01:02:58,270 --> 01:02:59,350
Right. What?

1541
01:02:59,690 --> 01:03:01,520
What is it, babe? What?

1542
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:02,940
Where's my money?

1543
01:03:03,020 --> 01:03:04,020
I don't know where your money...

1544
01:03:04,110 --> 01:03:06,110
Where is my fucking money? Where is it?

1545
01:03:06,190 --> 01:03:08,150
I don't know where your money is, Mr. Belfort.

1546
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:10,490
- I didn't do anything. - If you don't get...

1547
01:03:10,570 --> 01:03:11,870
He's lying through his fucking teeth.

1548
01:03:11,950 --> 01:03:13,120
Let's start from the beginning.

1549
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:14,450
Let's start from the beginning, all right?

1550
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:16,080
You invited some friends over, right?

1551
01:03:16,370 --> 01:03:18,040
One thing led to another. Things got out of hand.

1552
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:19,620
We understand that, we do.

1553
01:03:19,710 --> 01:03:22,130
We do blow all the time. We're fucking degenerates ourselves.

1554
01:03:22,210 --> 01:03:23,290
Look at us, right?

1555
01:03:23,380 --> 01:03:24,960
But money was stolen from my apartment.

1556
01:03:25,050 --> 01:03:26,630
Right from my sock drawer. All right?

1557
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,800
Like I said, I don't know where your money is.

1558
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:30,260
Just start from the beginning. Who came over?

1559
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:31,390
It was just a normal day.

1560
01:03:31,470 --> 01:03:32,800
I knew you were coming home the next day.

1561
01:03:32,890 --> 01:03:35,140
So everything would be fine. It'd be cleaned up.

1562
01:03:35,220 --> 01:03:37,140
I got a little high at breakfast.

1563
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:39,020
So I got a little happy. I had some eggs,

1564
01:03:39,100 --> 01:03:40,100
I had a little bit of ice cream.

1565
01:03:40,190 --> 01:03:42,020
And then I said, "Who do I know that likes ice cream?"

1566
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:43,560
It's my friend, Rudy. So I called Rudy.

1567
01:03:43,650 --> 01:03:46,110
- Who's Rudy? - Yeah, who's Rudy?

1568
01:03:47,650 --> 01:03:50,990
- You know who Rudy is. Come on. - Me? I don't...

1569
01:03:51,070 --> 01:03:52,200
- You know... - Who the fuck is Rudy?

1570
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:53,320
I don't know anyone named Rudy.

1571
01:03:53,410 --> 01:03:54,490
Last month. The Lollipop Club.

1572
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:56,040
You know who Rudy was. Dancing...

1573
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:57,540
You know who Rudy is?

1574
01:03:59,250 --> 01:04:00,620
I don't fucking know any...

1575
01:04:00,710 --> 01:04:01,670
What do you mean?

1576
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:02,830
So he went to The Lollipop Club?

1577
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:04,500
Oh, he was at The Lollipop Club for sure.

1578
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:06,170
On the stage, grinding with everybody.

1579
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:08,260
I got fucked up. I like to dance.

1580
01:04:08,380 --> 01:04:09,880
I don't know. Maybe I met him, maybe I didn't.

1581
01:04:09,970 --> 01:04:11,590
I meet a lot of fucking people.

1582
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:13,340
- What are you saying? - $50,000 was stolen

1583
01:04:13,430 --> 01:04:14,640
from my fucking sock drawer!

1584
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:16,220
All my girlfriend's jewelry is gone.

1585
01:04:16,310 --> 01:04:18,220
- Where the fuck is it? - Rudy. What the fuck?

1586
01:04:18,310 --> 01:04:20,350
Did your fucking little faggot friend Rudy take my shit?

1587
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:22,100
Did he? Answer me!

1588
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:24,690
Okay. Now I get it. Now I get why I'm...

1589
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:25,980
This is a gay thing.

1590
01:04:26,190 --> 01:04:27,650
See, all of you...

1591
01:04:27,980 --> 01:04:29,280
You think this is 'cause you're a fag?

1592
01:04:30,070 --> 01:04:31,400
My cousin's a fucking faggot.

1593
01:04:31,490 --> 01:04:33,200
And I go on vacation with him and his boyfriend.

1594
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:33,860
I love fags.

1595
01:04:33,950 --> 01:04:35,070
You were in charge, right?

1596
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:36,870
I will not be stolen from. You get that?

1597
01:04:36,950 --> 01:04:39,120
I fucking like gay people. I don't like you.

1598
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:40,290
He should've hired a fucking

1599
01:04:40,290 --> 01:04:41,830
Mexican like I have in my fucking house.

1600
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:45,040
Shit! What the fuck...

1601
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:50,630
Talk, you fuck, talk!

1602
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:51,840
I'm gonna drop you, you faggot!

1603
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:53,090
Where is it?

1604
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:56,300
Chester and Toby, they went all yakuza on Nicholas.

1605
01:04:56,390 --> 01:04:57,470
You know, they got crazy.

1606
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:58,600
I don't know!

1607
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:00,280
I had to call the cops

1608
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:02,310
just to keep them from killing the poor guy.

1609
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:03,650
I gave them each 1,000

1610
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:06,020
bucks and told them what Nicholas had done.

1611
01:05:06,310 --> 01:05:07,690
Then they kicked his ass.

1612
01:05:08,150 --> 01:05:09,530
Thanks again, Officer.

1613
01:05:09,860 --> 01:05:12,530
It's not like I cared about the 50 grand anyway.

1614
01:05:12,610 --> 01:05:14,240
I was making that much almost every day

1615
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:16,570
through one rathole or another.

1616
01:05:16,660 --> 01:05:19,410
Now a rathole is a friend, like Brad here,

1617
01:05:19,490 --> 01:05:22,040
who held stock in his name for me.

1618
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:24,370
Who are you supposed to be, huh? Jack Nickle-Jew?

1620
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:26,160
I'd drive the price up then

1621
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:29,250
he'd sell and kick most of the profits back to...

1622
01:05:29,340 --> 01:05:31,170
You guessed it, me.

1623
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:36,470
All cash. None of it's on the books.

1624
01:05:36,550 --> 01:05:38,850
A big no-no, of course, in the eyes of the law.

1625
01:05:39,890 --> 01:05:42,850
Enter our new securities attorney, Manny Riskin.

1626
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:46,680
700 bucks an hour to be the voice of doom.

1627
01:05:46,690 --> 01:05:48,440
Listen to me. You piss up the SEC's leg,

1628
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:49,730
you end up with your tits in a wringer.

1629
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:52,820
Do not worry about it. I have the SEC under control.

1630
01:05:53,190 --> 01:05:55,650
What the fuck are these imbeciles doing?

1631
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:58,490
What are you doing? Hey!

1632
01:05:58,660 --> 01:06:00,530
We got the SEC in here.

1633
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:02,700
The Securities and Exchange Commission

1634
01:06:02,790 --> 01:06:05,370
sent two lawyers down to review our files.

1635
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:07,370
So I set them up in our conference room

1636
01:06:07,460 --> 01:06:08,540
and I had it bugged

1637
01:06:08,630 --> 01:06:10,840
and the air conditioning turned up so high

1638
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:12,460
that it felt like Antarctica in there.

1639
01:06:12,550 --> 01:06:14,510
Is it always this cold in here?

1640
01:06:14,590 --> 01:06:15,630
I don't know.

1641
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:16,880
Then, while they were looking

1642
01:06:16,970 --> 01:06:18,390
for a smoking gun in that room...

1643
01:06:18,470 --> 01:06:20,260
Arncliffe International is on fire.

1644
01:06:20,970 --> 01:06:23,600
I was gonna fire off a bazooka in here,

1645
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:25,930
offering up our latest IPO.

1646
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:28,520
An IPO is an initial public offering.

1647
01:06:28,610 --> 01:06:29,990
It's the first time a stock

1648
01:06:29,990 --> 01:06:32,360
is offered for sale to the general population.

1649
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:34,320
Now, as the firm taking the company public,

1650
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:36,070
we set the initial sales price

1651
01:06:36,150 --> 01:06:38,910
then sold those shares right back to our friends. The...

1652
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:40,620
Look.

1653
01:06:40,740 --> 01:06:42,580
I know you're not following what I'm saying anyway, right?

1654
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:44,620
That's okay. That doesn't matter.

1655
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:46,540
The real question is this.

1656
01:06:46,620 --> 01:06:48,500
"Was all this legal?"

1657
01:06:48,580 --> 01:06:50,460
Absolutely fucking not.

1658
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:53,250
But we were making more money than we knew what to do with.

1659
01:06:57,630 --> 01:06:58,760
And what do you do when you're making

1660
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:00,300
more money than you know what to do with?

1661
01:07:06,310 --> 01:07:07,730
Oh, my God!

1662
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:09,770
Will you marry me?

1663
01:07:10,310 --> 01:07:11,650
Oh, my God.

1664
01:07:11,730 --> 01:07:13,730
Is that a yes?

1665
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:15,480
Are you sure?

1666
01:07:15,570 --> 01:07:17,440
Yeah, I'm sure. Yeah, I'm sure.

1667
01:07:17,780 --> 01:07:19,490
- Are you sure? - Yeah.

1668
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,300
I held my bachelor party

1669
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:33,380
at the Mirage in Las Vegas.

1670
01:07:33,630 --> 01:07:35,840
The flight there alone was a bacchanal.

1671
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:40,050
One last blowout for the gods before I settled down for good.

1672
01:07:40,470 --> 01:07:41,890
A hundred Strattonites,

1673
01:07:41,970 --> 01:07:42,710
50 hookers,

1674
01:07:42,710 --> 01:07:44,760
plus 50 more waiting once we landed.

1675
01:07:45,470 --> 01:07:46,470
Oh, and the drugs.

1676
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:48,480
I mean, I tell you, our plane

1677
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:50,390
was like a pharmacy with wings.

1678
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:23,180
All told, the weekend cost me two million bucks,

1679
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:28,270
including the cost of refurbishing the entire 28th floor.

1680
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:31,180
Kiss the bride.

1681
01:08:32,770 --> 01:08:36,230
But the wedding was something out of a fairy tale.

1682
01:08:36,770 --> 01:08:39,400
With Naomi, my Duchess,

1683
01:08:39,490 --> 01:08:40,990
me, her handsome Duke,

1684
01:08:41,070 --> 01:08:44,110
and The Bahamas Ocean Club, our castle.

1685
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:57,840
Of course, after the bachelor party, me, the Duke,

1686
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:00,670
needed a few penicillin shots so he could

1687
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:02,880
safely consummate the marriage.

1689
01:09:08,260 --> 01:09:10,060
Hey! Barry Kleinman, filming the wedding.

1690
01:09:10,270 --> 01:09:11,560
A few words for your son?

1691
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:14,310
Jordan. Remember what I told you.

1692
01:09:14,390 --> 01:09:17,520
It involves your penis and her vagina.

1693
01:09:17,610 --> 01:09:20,570
And you know, you know what you can do, Jordy.

1694
01:09:38,090 --> 01:09:39,380
Oh, my God!

1695
01:09:39,460 --> 01:09:40,840
Aunt Emma?

1696
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:46,930
I can't believe you came!

1697
01:09:47,430 --> 01:09:50,600
Jordan! Jordan! Look who came!

1698
01:09:51,390 --> 01:09:52,430
It's Aunt Emma.

1699
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:54,600
Aunt Emma.

1700
01:09:54,730 --> 01:09:57,060
- Oh, Jordan, dear, how lovely. - Hey, how you doing?

1701
01:09:57,940 --> 01:10:00,610
It's a pleasure to finally meet you in person.

1702
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:02,610
Into the donuts, I see.

1704
01:10:02,690 --> 01:10:05,030
Oh, I... I...

1705
01:10:05,110 --> 01:10:06,320
Well...

1706
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:09,450
I lived through the '60s, my dear.

1708
01:10:09,530 --> 01:10:10,990
Enjoy the day.

1709
01:10:11,330 --> 01:10:13,500
She surprised me. I didn't even know.

1710
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:29,340
Just one more step. Are you ready?

1711
01:10:29,430 --> 01:10:31,010
- Where are we going? - Keep your eyes closed.

1712
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:32,470
One, two, three!

1713
01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:36,020
What is this?

1714
01:10:36,310 --> 01:10:38,150
- It's your wedding present. - What?

1715
01:10:38,230 --> 01:10:39,560
It's your wedding present, sweetheart.

1716
01:10:41,020 --> 01:10:42,400
What?

1717
01:10:42,860 --> 01:10:44,990
- Are you serious? - I'm serious.

1718
01:10:45,070 --> 01:10:46,190
A fucking yacht?

1719
01:10:46,820 --> 01:10:49,200
For millionaires whose ships have come in,

1720
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:52,080
pricey pleasure boats are for the most fun afloat.

1721
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:55,250
It's no coincidence that its 150 feet of green hull

1722
01:10:55,330 --> 01:10:57,500
is the color of cash. Anchors aweigh!

1723
01:10:57,580 --> 01:10:59,830
Oh, my God! Baby!

1724
01:11:02,170 --> 01:11:03,800
- I think you like it? - You're crazy.

1725
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:05,300
- You like it? - Yes!

1726
01:11:10,970 --> 01:11:11,580
For three weeks,

1727
01:11:11,580 --> 01:11:13,760
we sailed the Naomi through the Caribbean,

1728
01:11:13,850 --> 01:11:15,850
eventually taking her home to Long Island,

1729
01:11:15,930 --> 01:11:17,020
where we bought a house.

1730
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:19,690
Seven acres on the Gold Coast of Long Island.

1731
01:11:19,810 --> 01:11:22,270
The most expensive real estate in the world.

1732
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:25,030
With maids, cooks, landscapers, you name it.

1733
01:11:25,110 --> 01:11:27,570
We even had two guards who worked in shifts.

1734
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:28,740
Both named Rocco.

1736
01:11:32,870 --> 01:11:34,950
It was heaven on earth.

1737
01:11:37,830 --> 01:11:39,290
Wake up, you piece of shit!

1738
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:41,080
Who's Venice?

1739
01:11:41,170 --> 01:11:42,500
Who?

1740
01:11:42,590 --> 01:11:43,590
Who? Who?

1741
01:11:43,670 --> 01:11:45,340
"Who?" What are you, a fucking owl?

1742
01:11:45,420 --> 01:11:46,590
Who is she?

1743
01:11:46,710 --> 01:11:48,130
Some little hooker you were fucking last night?

1744
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:50,130
What the fuck are you talking about? No.

1745
01:11:50,220 --> 01:11:51,800
No way, baby, no!

1746
01:11:51,890 --> 01:11:54,220
You were calling her name in your sleep!

1747
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:56,930
Are you out of your fucking mind? I don't...

1748
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:59,140
I don't even know who Venice is.

1749
01:11:59,230 --> 01:12:01,440
What the fuck does that even mean? Venice.

1750
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:04,270
That's the stupidest shit I've ever heard in my fucking life!

1751
01:12:08,070 --> 01:12:10,240
Venice...

1752
01:12:10,740 --> 01:12:12,820
Venice, baby, where are you?

1753
01:12:13,530 --> 01:12:17,040
Venice!

1754
01:12:17,410 --> 01:12:18,830
Where'd you go?

1755
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:25,670
Oh, baby. Oh, you're gonna play rough, huh?

1756
01:12:25,750 --> 01:12:27,920
- Oh, Jesus Christ! - You like that?

1757
01:12:30,260 --> 01:12:32,380
I like it. I like it.

1758
01:12:32,550 --> 01:12:34,260
Wolfie, Wolfie, Wolfie, Wolfie.

1759
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:35,470
Wolfie?

1760
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:36,850
Yeah, it's my safe word, baby. It's my safe word.

1761
01:12:36,930 --> 01:12:38,350
I don't give a fuck about your safe word!

1762
01:12:38,430 --> 01:12:40,520
- Come on! - Shut the fuck up!

1763
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:42,980
Shut up, you little bitch!

1764
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:45,560
You're a fucking dirty little birdy!

1765
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:48,650
That's right.

1766
01:12:48,780 --> 01:12:50,030
That's right! I forgot.

1767
01:12:50,150 --> 01:12:51,610
I forgot, baby.

1768
01:12:51,740 --> 01:12:56,030
Donnie and I were investing in a condominium complex in Venice.

1769
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:57,240
That's why all this confusion.

1770
01:12:57,330 --> 01:12:58,870
Oh, you're investing in Italy?

1771
01:12:58,950 --> 01:13:00,660
Not Italy. California.

1772
01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:02,250
- Oh, California? - Yeah.

1773
01:13:02,330 --> 01:13:03,460
You're a lying piece of shit!

1774
01:13:03,540 --> 01:13:04,710
Duchess, baby, come on.

1775
01:13:04,790 --> 01:13:06,330
Don't you fucking "Duchess" Me.

1776
01:13:06,460 --> 01:13:07,880
Don't you "Duchess" Me!

1777
01:13:08,130 --> 01:13:11,090
Do you really think that I don't know what you're up to?

1778
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:13,090
- You're a father now, Jordan. - Yeah.

1779
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:14,590
- You're a father now. - I know...

1780
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:16,390
And you're still acting like an infant!

1781
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:19,350
God damn it!

1782
01:13:19,430 --> 01:13:22,100
Baby, you know, you got real anger issues.

1783
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:24,520
Who is the one who flew in here

1784
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:27,480
at 3 in the morning on their stupid helicopter

1785
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:29,610
and woke up Skylar? That was you!

1786
01:13:29,690 --> 01:13:32,320
Oh, Skylar! Oh, fucking bullshit!

1787
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:47,130
Does it even matter to you that I just had that driving range

1788
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:50,420
sodded with Bermuda grass, Jordan,

1790
01:13:50,510 --> 01:13:52,550
- and now you fucking wrecked it! - Oh, my God... Bermuda grass.

1791
01:13:52,630 --> 01:13:54,380
No, you didn't research the whole thing

1792
01:13:54,470 --> 01:13:56,550
and deal with the fucking golf course people!

1793
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:57,800
Oh, my God,

1794
01:13:57,890 --> 01:14:00,430
you had to deal with the golf course people, too!

1795
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:03,180
What a Greek tragedy, honey! Oh, my God!

1796
01:14:03,310 --> 01:14:06,190
You probably had to pay them in cash with your hands!

1797
01:14:06,270 --> 01:14:07,480
What a fucking burden.

1798
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:09,520
And actually do some work

1799
01:14:09,610 --> 01:14:11,730
besides swiping my fucking credit card all day, huh?

1800
01:14:11,820 --> 01:14:14,530
Because I can't keep track of your professions, honey.

1801
01:14:14,610 --> 01:14:16,490
'Cause last month you were a wine connoisseur.

1802
01:14:16,570 --> 01:14:18,620
Now you're an aspiring landscape architect!

1803
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:20,370
- Let me get that right... No! - Fuck you!

1804
01:14:20,450 --> 01:14:22,450
Don't fucking dare throw that fucking water at me.

1805
01:14:22,540 --> 01:14:25,000
Don't you fucking dare.

1806
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:27,370
All right, honey?

1807
01:14:27,750 --> 01:14:28,960
Now will you just...

1808
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:30,920
We could talk this out, all right?

1809
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,380
We just use our words. You know?

1810
01:14:33,460 --> 01:14:34,550
Communicate.

1811
01:14:34,630 --> 01:14:35,840
Okay?

1812
01:14:36,380 --> 01:14:37,680
Come on, sweetheart.

1813
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:39,720
Talk to me. Talk to me.

1814
01:14:39,850 --> 01:14:41,890
Stop flexing your muscles, Jordan.

1815
01:14:41,970 --> 01:14:43,680
You look like a fucking imbecile.

1816
01:14:43,770 --> 01:14:45,060
Babe, come on.

1817
01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:48,310
You should feel happy you got a husband

1818
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:50,650
who's in such great shape like this, huh?

1819
01:14:51,570 --> 01:14:52,690
Come here.

1820
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:54,320
Come on, give me a kiss.

1821
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:55,440
You look so beautiful right now.

1822
01:14:55,570 --> 01:14:56,650
- Come on. - Kiss you?

1823
01:14:56,740 --> 01:14:57,900
- You look so beautiful... - Kiss you?

1824
01:14:57,990 --> 01:14:59,610
Yeah, give me one...

1825
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:01,910
Fuck you!

1826
01:15:01,990 --> 01:15:03,990
Ah, yes, my morning ritual.

1827
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,450
First I'd get up and fight with Naomi

1828
01:15:06,540 --> 01:15:08,750
about whatever it is I did the night before.

1829
01:15:08,830 --> 01:15:11,040
Next was a steam so I could sweat out

1830
01:15:11,130 --> 01:15:12,880
the drugs still in my system.

1831
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:14,590
Then I'd assess the damage.

1832
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:16,590
Drown out my eyeballs.

1833
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:19,220
Take my "Back pills" To get the day started,

1834
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:21,390
then seek to make up with Naomi.

1835
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:23,430
Good morning, Daddy.

1836
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:25,600
Where's my kiss?

1837
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:29,060
Hey, sweetheart.

1838
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:33,820
Does Daddy get a kiss from both of his little girls, huh?

1839
01:15:33,940 --> 01:15:35,280
Oh, no.

1840
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:38,450
No, Daddy doesn't even get to touch Mommy

1841
01:15:38,530 --> 01:15:40,280
for a very, very,

1842
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:42,120
very long time.

1843
01:15:42,660 --> 01:15:45,410
Daddy's really sorry about what he said in the other room.

1844
01:15:45,490 --> 01:15:46,700
He didn't mean any of it.

1845
01:15:46,790 --> 01:15:49,080
Daddy shouldn't waste his time.

1846
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:51,210
And from now on,

1847
01:15:52,630 --> 01:15:54,790
it's gonna be nothing but short,

1848
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,210
short skirts around the house.

1849
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:02,300
And you know something else, Daddy?

1850
01:16:03,950 --> 01:16:08,940
Mommy is just so sick and tired of wearing panties.

1851
01:16:11,190 --> 01:16:13,150
- Yeah? - Yeah.

1852
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:16,940
In fact,

1853
01:16:18,950 --> 01:16:21,700
she's decided to throw them

1854
01:16:21,780 --> 01:16:24,990
all away.

1855
01:16:30,790 --> 01:16:32,670
So take a good look, Daddy.

1856
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:36,130
You're gonna be seeing an awful lot of this around the house.

1857
01:16:36,210 --> 01:16:37,750
Oh, baby...

1858
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:39,300
Yeah, Mommy.

1859
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:41,720
- Yeah... - But no touching.

1860
01:16:42,340 --> 01:16:43,890
Oh, gosh.

1861
01:16:48,390 --> 01:16:50,100
What's wrong, Daddy?

1862
01:16:50,180 --> 01:16:51,520
Baby.

1863
01:16:53,650 --> 01:16:54,850
God!

1864
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:57,690
Look at this shit.

1865
01:16:57,820 --> 01:17:01,530
Okay. Mommy likes to play games with Daddy.

1866
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:07,870
Mommy, have you ever noticed anything odd about Mr.

1867
01:17:08,330 --> 01:17:09,910
Mr. Fuzzy Bear over there?

1868
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:15,210
His eyes seem to be a little bit odd, don't they?

1869
01:17:15,710 --> 01:17:19,170
Yeah, there's something a little bit different about his eyes.

1870
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:22,470
Yes! I think it's true. Say "Hi," Mommy.

1871
01:17:22,550 --> 01:17:24,380
Say "Hi" To Rocco and Rocco.

1872
01:17:24,470 --> 01:17:25,800
Say "Hi." Hi, fellas.

1873
01:17:25,930 --> 01:17:27,300
See that, huh?

1874
01:17:27,390 --> 01:17:29,140
Of all the fucking days,

1875
01:17:29,220 --> 01:17:30,970
she chooses today to give me blue balls!

1876
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:34,140
I mean, today was the biggest day in Stratton's history,

1877
01:17:34,230 --> 01:17:36,060
and I needed to be thinking straight.

1878
01:17:36,150 --> 01:17:37,560
Hey, Jordan!

1879
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:39,730
- Welcome. - Steve here yet?

1880
01:17:39,820 --> 01:17:42,940
This was the day that we launched the Steve Madden IPO.

1881
01:17:43,110 --> 01:17:45,160
Troops are all here, everyone's all rallied, excited.

1882
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:47,030
Everything had to run tight.

1883
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:48,160
It had to be perfect.

1884
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:50,410
What the fuck is that kid doing?

1885
01:17:50,750 --> 01:17:52,080
What's he doing?

1886
01:17:52,790 --> 01:17:54,660
The biggest IPO in this firm's history.

1887
01:17:54,870 --> 01:17:57,040
What the fuck is he doing?

1888
01:17:58,090 --> 01:18:00,050
Is he... Is he wearing a bow tie?

1889
01:18:00,340 --> 01:18:01,420
Hi.

1890
01:18:02,590 --> 01:18:03,670
How're you doing?

1891
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:04,760
Good.

1892
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:07,470
You cleaning the fish bowl?

1893
01:18:08,550 --> 01:18:10,640
I just... I had a minute and...

1894
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:12,430
You had a minute.

1895
01:18:12,730 --> 01:18:15,060
And today you needed to clean the fish bowl? Today?

1896
01:18:15,140 --> 01:18:18,810
I had finished my paperwork and I had a couple of minutes.

1897
01:18:18,980 --> 01:18:20,770
Okay. Nice to meet you.

1898
01:18:26,780 --> 01:18:28,030
On new issue day?

1899
01:18:29,700 --> 01:18:32,290
On cocksucking, motherfucking new issue day?

1900
01:18:32,410 --> 01:18:33,580
This is what you do?

1901
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:36,540
Hey, everybody, listen up!

1902
01:18:37,170 --> 01:18:38,160
This is what happens when

1903
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:39,790
you fuck with your pets on new issue day!

1904
01:18:53,470 --> 01:18:55,310
Take your little bow tie, get your shit,

1905
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:57,480
and get the fuck out of my office! You understand?

1906
01:18:57,560 --> 01:18:59,060
Get the fuck out!

1907
01:19:02,730 --> 01:19:04,230
Everybody on point!

1908
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:07,240
We are here to make money. Everybody on point.

1909
01:19:09,740 --> 01:19:12,490
A real wolf pit, which is exactly how I liked it.

1910
01:19:12,580 --> 01:19:14,420
Jordan, look what I caught in the lobby.

1911
01:19:14,430 --> 01:19:15,200
I caught a genius.

1912
01:19:15,330 --> 01:19:16,750
Enter Steve Madden.

1913
01:19:16,870 --> 01:19:17,960
The great American cobbler.

1914
01:19:18,040 --> 01:19:20,420
Red-hot ladies footwear impresario.

1915
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:22,240
And thanks to Donnie,

1916
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:24,090
we were taking his company public.

1917
01:19:24,170 --> 01:19:27,880
Stratton Oakmont was crawling out of the primordial ooze.

1918
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:29,970
Pond scum no more.

1919
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:31,590
That's why they gotta see your face.

1920
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:32,560
You get them fired up so

1921
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:34,140
they push the shit out of this stock. Okay?

1922
01:19:34,220 --> 01:19:36,810
And not only that, Donnie and I secretly owned

1923
01:19:36,890 --> 01:19:39,190
85% of Steve Madden Shoes,

1924
01:19:39,770 --> 01:19:41,770
which legally speaking was a big no-no,

1925
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:45,230
but we'd get filthy fucking rich if our troops got behind it.

1926
01:19:45,570 --> 01:19:47,820
Our job was to get them worked up.

1927
01:19:47,990 --> 01:19:49,700
But not too worked up.

1928
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:52,490
Hello. If...

1929
01:19:53,530 --> 01:19:55,700
For those of you who don't know me...

1930
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,040
My name's Steve Madden.

1931
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:58,660
Yeah, we know who you are.

1932
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:00,250
Your name is on the box.

1933
01:20:00,460 --> 01:20:02,000
Get the shoes. Show them the shoes.

1934
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:03,670
- Show them the shoes. - Okay. Yeah.

1935
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:06,960
Anyway, you know, this shoe is pretty cool.

1936
01:20:07,050 --> 01:20:07,910
This is the Mary Lou,

1937
01:20:07,910 --> 01:20:09,880
which is really the shoe that put me on the map.

1938
01:20:09,970 --> 01:20:11,550
Without it, I wouldn't be here.

1939
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:12,800
It's a fat girls' shoe!

1940
01:20:12,890 --> 01:20:14,850
Believe it or not... Believe it or not though,

1941
01:20:14,970 --> 01:20:16,220
the Mary Lou is actually the

1943
01:20:16,220 --> 01:20:18,270
same as the Mary Jane, but it's black leather.

1944
01:20:24,690 --> 01:20:27,570
Fight back! Come on! Where you at? Where you at?

1945
01:20:27,860 --> 01:20:29,150
All right!

1946
01:20:29,240 --> 01:20:32,490
Let's give it up for Steve Madden and his awesome Mary Lou!

1947
01:20:32,570 --> 01:20:34,740
Hold that up. Hold that up. Hold that up proud!

1948
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:37,290
Give him a round of applause!

1949
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:40,620
You guys got that out of your systems, huh?

1950
01:20:41,580 --> 01:20:43,580
You having a good afternoon or what?

1951
01:20:44,130 --> 01:20:47,170
I wanna take a moment and tell you why Steve here is so

1952
01:20:47,250 --> 01:20:49,550
absolutely off the fucking wall.

1953
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:54,340
It's because this man is a creative genius.

1954
01:20:54,930 --> 01:20:58,430
This ability, this gift that Steve has,

1955
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:01,850
it goes beyond just spotting the hottest shoe trends.

1956
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:05,690
Steve's power is that he creates trends.

1957
01:21:06,020 --> 01:21:07,440
You understand?

1958
01:21:07,650 --> 01:21:09,730
Artists like Steve come along once every decade.

1959
01:21:09,820 --> 01:21:12,250
I'm talking Giorgio Armani, Gianni Versace,

1960
01:21:12,250 --> 01:21:13,240
Coco Chanel,

1961
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:14,950
Yves Saint Laurent.

1962
01:21:15,410 --> 01:21:17,030
Steve, come over here for a second.

1963
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:19,290
I don't think you all realize

1964
01:21:19,950 --> 01:21:21,330
that Steve Madden

1965
01:21:21,660 --> 01:21:24,960
is the hottest person in the women's shoe industry,

1966
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:26,330
with orders going through the roof

1967
01:21:26,420 --> 01:21:29,750
at every department store in North America right now.

1968
01:21:30,260 --> 01:21:32,260
We have him here in our office!

1969
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:36,090
We should thank our fucking lucky stars this man is here!

1970
01:21:36,180 --> 01:21:38,760
We should be on our hands and knees right now,

1971
01:21:38,850 --> 01:21:40,930
getting ready to suck this guy off!

1972
01:21:41,020 --> 01:21:43,560
Like this! Okay?

1973
01:21:43,810 --> 01:21:45,440
I wanna suck you off, Steve!

1974
01:21:46,310 --> 01:21:47,900
Everyone's gonna suck you off!

1975
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:49,770
This is our golden ticket

1976
01:21:49,980 --> 01:21:52,280
to the fucking chocolate factory right here!

1977
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:54,320
And I wanna meet

1978
01:21:54,490 --> 01:21:56,660
Willy fucking Wonka, okay?

1979
01:21:57,320 --> 01:22:00,160
I wanna be with the fucking Oompa Loompas like this!

1980
01:22:04,250 --> 01:22:06,670
All right, get off this fucking stage! Get out of here.

1981
01:22:07,210 --> 01:22:09,540
All right, I want all of you to focus for a second.

1982
01:22:10,090 --> 01:22:12,090
See those little black boxes?

1983
01:22:12,340 --> 01:22:13,420
They're called telephones.

1984
01:22:13,510 --> 01:22:16,260
I'm gonna let you in on a little secret about these telephones.

1985
01:22:16,340 --> 01:22:18,930
They're not gonna dial themselves. Okay?

1986
01:22:19,050 --> 01:22:22,770
Without you, they're just worthless hunks of plastic.

1987
01:22:23,390 --> 01:22:24,830
Like a loaded M16

1988
01:22:24,830 --> 01:22:26,980
without a trained Marine to pull the trigger.

1989
01:22:28,020 --> 01:22:30,440
And in the case of the telephone,

1990
01:22:30,610 --> 01:22:33,230
it's up to each and every one of you,

1991
01:22:34,740 --> 01:22:36,820
my highly-trained Strattonites.

1992
01:22:37,950 --> 01:22:39,240
My killers!

1993
01:22:39,990 --> 01:22:43,290
My killers, who will not take no for an answer!

1994
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:45,750
My fucking warriors,

1995
01:22:46,210 --> 01:22:48,210
who will not hang up the phone

1996
01:22:48,290 --> 01:22:51,290
until their client either buys

1997
01:22:51,380 --> 01:22:53,550
or fucking dies!

1998
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:10,100
Let me tell you something.

1999
01:23:10,190 --> 01:23:13,190
There is no nobility in poverty.

2000
01:23:13,650 --> 01:23:15,000
I have been a rich man

2001
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,650
and I have been a poor man.

2002
01:23:16,740 --> 01:23:19,160
And I choose rich every fucking time.

2003
01:23:20,410 --> 01:23:21,470
Because at least as a rich man,

2004
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:23,080
when I have to face my problems,

2005
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:25,220
I show up in the back of a limo,

2006
01:23:25,220 --> 01:23:27,000
wearing a $2,000 suit

2007
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:29,670
and a $40,000 gold fucking watch!

2008
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:35,000
Duke it out! Hit him!

2009
01:23:35,090 --> 01:23:36,510
Get the fuck off me!

2010
01:23:37,970 --> 01:23:42,140
And if anyone here thinks I'm superficial or materialistic,

2011
01:23:42,260 --> 01:23:44,510
go get a job at fucking McDonald's,

2012
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:46,600
'cause that's where you fucking belong!

2013
01:23:48,730 --> 01:23:52,270
But before you depart this room full of winners,

2014
01:23:53,070 --> 01:23:56,150
I want you to take a good look at the person next to you. Go on.

2015
01:23:57,150 --> 01:23:59,400
Because sometime in the not-so-distant future,

2016
01:23:59,820 --> 01:24:01,160
you're gonna be pulling up to

2017
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:03,280
a red light in your beat-up old fucking Pinto,

2018
01:24:03,620 --> 01:24:06,660
and that person's gonna be pulling up right alongside you

2019
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:08,870
in their brand new Porsche

2020
01:24:09,710 --> 01:24:11,710
with their beautiful wife by their side,

2021
01:24:11,790 --> 01:24:13,790
who's got big voluptuous tits.

2022
01:24:15,460 --> 01:24:17,710
And who're you gonna be sitting next to?

2023
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:21,090
Some disgusting wildebeest with three days of razor-stubble,

2024
01:24:21,180 --> 01:24:22,510
in a sleeveless muumuu,

2025
01:24:22,590 --> 01:24:23,350
crammed in next to you

2026
01:24:23,350 --> 01:24:26,810
in a carload full of groceries from the fucking Price Club!

2027
01:24:26,890 --> 01:24:29,180
That's who you're gonna be sitting next to!

2028
01:24:29,270 --> 01:24:31,520
So you listen to me and you listen well.

2029
01:24:31,650 --> 01:24:33,860
Are you behind on your credit card bills?

2030
01:24:34,270 --> 01:24:36,440
Good! Pick up the phone and start dialing!

2031
01:24:36,860 --> 01:24:38,840
Is your landlord ready to evict you?

2032
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:41,860
Good! Pick up the phone and start dialing!

2033
01:24:41,990 --> 01:24:45,240
Does your girlfriend think you're a fucking worthless loser?

2034
01:24:45,330 --> 01:24:48,370
Good! Pick up the phone and start dialing!

2035
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:52,000
I want you to deal with your problems by becoming rich!

2036
01:24:54,170 --> 01:24:57,460
All you have to do today is pick up that phone

2037
01:24:58,670 --> 01:25:01,510
and speak the words that I have taught you.

2038
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:03,760
And I will make you richer

2039
01:25:03,890 --> 01:25:04,900
than the most powerful

2040
01:25:04,900 --> 01:25:06,930
CEO in the United States of fucking America!

2041
01:25:07,010 --> 01:25:08,180
Yeah!

2042
01:25:09,350 --> 01:25:10,600
Fuck, yeah!

2043
01:25:11,230 --> 01:25:13,310
I want you to go out there

2044
01:25:14,060 --> 01:25:15,860
and I want you to ram

2045
01:25:16,190 --> 01:25:19,440
Steve Madden stock down your clients' throats

2046
01:25:19,530 --> 01:25:21,820
until they fucking choke on it!

2047
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:25,880
Till they choke on it and they buy 100,000 shares!

2048
01:25:25,880 --> 01:25:26,490
That's what I want.

2049
01:25:26,580 --> 01:25:28,120
Yeah! Fuck, yeah.

2050
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:29,830
You be ferocious!

2051
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:31,870
- You be relentless! - Yeah!

2052
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:35,250
You be telephone fucking terrorists!

2053
01:25:36,710 --> 01:25:40,300
Now let's knock this motherfucker out of the park!

2054
01:26:10,620 --> 01:26:11,520
At 1:00 p.m.,

2055
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:15,330
we opened the stock for sale at $4.50 a share.

2056
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:18,540
By 1:03, it was over $18.

2057
01:26:18,670 --> 01:26:20,960
Even the big Wall Street firms were buying.

2058
01:26:30,890 --> 01:26:32,810
Of the two million shares offered for sale,

2059
01:26:32,890 --> 01:26:35,850
a million belonged to me, held in phony accounts by my ratholes.

2060
01:26:35,940 --> 01:26:38,100
Now once the price hit the high teens...

2061
01:26:38,270 --> 01:26:40,400
You know what? Who gives a shit?

2062
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:42,440
As always, the point is this.

2063
01:26:42,570 --> 01:26:46,950
$22 million in three fucking hours!

2064
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:49,950
Can you believe this shit?

2065
01:26:50,240 --> 01:26:51,590
I fucking love this, baby!

2066
01:26:51,590 --> 01:26:52,450
It's amazing!

2067
01:26:52,540 --> 01:26:53,950
Jordan!

2068
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:55,370
Barry Kleinman's on the phone

2069
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:57,080
- from Future Video. - Who?

2070
01:26:57,170 --> 01:26:58,370
I don't know. He shot at your wedding.

2071
01:26:58,460 --> 01:26:59,500
He says it's urgent.

2072
01:26:59,630 --> 01:27:01,710
Urgent? Who the fuck is Barry Kleinman?

2073
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:03,380
Oh, my God, you wanna marry me?

2074
01:27:03,460 --> 01:27:04,510
You're in love with me?

2075
01:27:04,590 --> 01:27:05,630
Yeah. Go fuck your cousin!

2076
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:06,760
Hey, Barry, what's up?

2077
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:08,970
Listen, I got this subpoena.

2078
01:27:09,050 --> 01:27:10,510
Subpoena? What the fuck are you talking about?

2079
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:11,390
Yeah, the FBI,

2080
01:27:11,390 --> 01:27:13,220
they want a copy of your wedding video.

2081
01:27:13,310 --> 01:27:14,470
The fucking FBI?

2082
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:16,520
- You fucking kidding me? - Listen to me.

2083
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:17,890
His name is Denham.

2084
01:27:17,980 --> 01:27:19,650
He's an agent with the New York office.

2085
01:27:19,730 --> 01:27:20,770
What's his problem?

2086
01:27:20,860 --> 01:27:21,800
Gordon GekkoHe's a Boy Scout.

2087
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:23,480
He thinks you're fucking Gordon Gekko.

2089
01:27:24,780 --> 01:27:26,030
What does he want with my wedding video?

2090
01:27:26,110 --> 01:27:27,740
It's like an invasion of my privacy.

2091
01:27:27,820 --> 01:27:29,160
You know what I'm saying? It's like...

2092
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:30,570
It's intrusive, you know.

2093
01:27:30,660 --> 01:27:33,330
He's got pictures of your whole inner fucking circle.

2094
01:27:33,410 --> 01:27:35,240
Pictures, names of the people.

2095
01:27:35,330 --> 01:27:36,330
You know what he's trying to do?

2096
01:27:36,410 --> 01:27:37,540
Exactly what he's doing. Look at yourself.

2097
01:27:37,660 --> 01:27:38,830
He's trying to rattle you,

2098
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:40,420
he's trying to rattle your old lady,

2099
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:41,480
so she nags you

2100
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:43,210
until you become a fucking witness.

2101
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:44,750
He wants me to rat on myself?

2102
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:46,630
He wants me to give information about my...

2103
01:27:47,010 --> 01:27:48,550
Listen. The good fucking news is,

2104
01:27:48,630 --> 01:27:50,430
you know I know everybody downtown,

2105
01:27:50,510 --> 01:27:52,720
I call up the Justice Department, the DEA,

2106
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:54,770
nobody even knows you fucking exist,

2107
01:27:54,770 --> 01:27:55,890
so calm down!

2108
01:27:56,180 --> 01:27:57,390
They don't know I exist?

2109
01:27:57,680 --> 01:27:59,310
- No. - That's good.

2110
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:05,360
But you...

2111
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:06,900
You know who he is, right?

2112
01:28:07,650 --> 01:28:10,450
- Yeah. - So, if I just wanted to get some more information,

2113
01:28:10,450 --> 01:28:11,660
just find out what he knows,

2114
01:28:11,740 --> 01:28:14,950
you could go to his house, right?

2115
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:16,910
Tap his phones a little bit, bug him.

2116
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,120
You could get some information...

2117
01:28:18,210 --> 01:28:21,000
You don't fuck with these guys like that.

2118
01:28:21,080 --> 01:28:22,170
You don't fuck with them like that.

2119
01:28:22,250 --> 01:28:23,420
What are you, nuts or something?

2120
01:28:23,500 --> 01:28:24,220
This is what you fucking do.

2121
01:28:24,220 --> 01:28:25,130
What do I pay you for?

2122
01:28:25,210 --> 01:28:27,110
I have a fucking P.I. License, you know?

2123
01:28:27,110 --> 01:28:28,300
I make a living at this.

2124
01:28:28,380 --> 01:28:29,470
I'm not a cop anymore.

2125
01:28:29,550 --> 01:28:31,550
They'll take my fucking license away from me, all right?

2126
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:32,720
Okay.

2127
01:28:33,430 --> 01:28:35,680
Okay, if I can't do that, can I just...

2128
01:28:35,970 --> 01:28:37,220
Can I give the guy a call?

2129
01:28:38,430 --> 01:28:40,430
- Why? Is that... - Jordan. Jordan.

2130
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:41,520
Do me a favor?

2131
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:43,410
The only one who calls this guy

2132
01:28:43,410 --> 01:28:44,520
is your fucking lawyer.

2133
01:28:44,610 --> 01:28:45,610
I can't call him, right?

2134
01:28:45,690 --> 01:28:47,440
- It's against the rules? - I told you,

2135
01:28:47,530 --> 01:28:49,190
whatever the fuck you say to him,

2136
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:51,900
he's gonna use against you. Don't you understand?

2137
01:28:51,990 --> 01:28:53,740
He's smart, you're dumb.

2138
01:28:53,820 --> 01:28:55,070
Fucking bullshit.

2139
01:28:55,660 --> 01:28:57,070
Are we fucking talking tonight,

2140
01:28:57,070 --> 01:28:58,160
or are you gonna get schwacked?

2141
01:28:58,250 --> 01:28:59,790
The last time you took these fucking pills,

2142
01:28:59,910 --> 01:29:01,090
you put your head in the fucking macaroni.

2143
01:29:01,090 --> 01:29:01,870
I had to pick it up.

2144
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:04,420
All right.

2145
01:29:04,500 --> 01:29:06,040
Okay, I won't call him.

2146
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:12,880
Hey, fellas! Come on board. The plank's right around there.

2147
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:15,140
Welcome!

2148
01:29:15,850 --> 01:29:17,930
What a nice day.

2149
01:29:19,180 --> 01:29:20,270
Hey.

2150
01:29:20,730 --> 01:29:22,270
Welcome aboard.

2151
01:29:22,770 --> 01:29:24,650
Jordan. Welcome aboard the Naomi.

2152
01:29:24,650 --> 01:29:25,400
Pleasure to meet you.

2153
01:29:25,480 --> 01:29:27,060
Agent Denham. This is Agent Hughes.

2154
01:29:27,150 --> 01:29:28,190
Hi, how are you?

2155
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:30,100
Let me introduce you. This is Nicole,

2156
01:29:30,100 --> 01:29:31,530
Heidi. Come on. Don't be shy.

2157
01:29:31,610 --> 01:29:34,110
What are you guys all shy for? Don't be scared.

2158
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:35,360
These are friends of Stratton.

2159
01:29:35,450 --> 01:29:36,950
- It's a pleasure. - Hello.

2160
01:29:39,620 --> 01:29:43,080
Your message said that you wanted to speak privately.

2161
01:29:43,290 --> 01:29:44,960
Right. I do want to speak privately.

2162
01:29:45,130 --> 01:29:46,380
Give us a minute, huh, ladies?

2163
01:29:46,460 --> 01:29:48,040
Let me know if I can get you anything.

2164
01:29:48,130 --> 01:29:49,960
We'd be happy to help.

2165
01:29:50,170 --> 01:29:51,210
You guys hungry?

2166
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:52,100
Want something to eat?

2167
01:29:52,100 --> 01:29:54,090
Got some pasta, shrimp, lobster.

2168
01:29:54,180 --> 01:29:54,890
I got whiskey.

2169
01:29:54,890 --> 01:29:56,550
Any kind of booze you want.

2170
01:29:56,640 --> 01:29:59,600
You know what? The Bureau doesn't allow us to drink while we're at sea.

2171
01:29:59,770 --> 01:30:02,220
Duh! Of course.

2172
01:30:02,310 --> 01:30:04,140
Ever been on one of these before?

2173
01:30:04,310 --> 01:30:05,560
A boat?

2174
01:30:06,310 --> 01:30:07,610
I learned how to sail when I was six.

2175
01:30:07,690 --> 01:30:09,770
No shit. Is that right? Really?

2176
01:30:09,860 --> 01:30:11,570
I mean on one like this, though?

2177
01:30:11,650 --> 01:30:12,700
I mean I had the whole front extended

2178
01:30:12,700 --> 01:30:14,450
in order to fit the chopper up there.

2179
01:30:14,570 --> 01:30:15,860
See that?

2180
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:18,620
Anyway, this is for you.

2181
01:30:18,700 --> 01:30:21,540
It's a complete list of every person that was at my wedding.

2182
01:30:21,620 --> 01:30:24,370
I understand you wanted the whole wedding video.

2183
01:30:24,460 --> 01:30:27,210
Figured this would help expedite the whole process, right?

2184
01:30:27,290 --> 01:30:30,310
- There you go. - Look, my point is that

2185
01:30:30,310 --> 01:30:32,050
I know you're investigating Stratton.

2186
01:30:32,130 --> 01:30:35,630
But for the life of me, I can't figure out why.

2187
01:30:36,010 --> 01:30:37,380
I know we're a little unorthodox,

2188
01:30:37,470 --> 01:30:39,180
we're a little loud in the way we do things.

2189
01:30:39,260 --> 01:30:40,390
But you gotta understand,

2190
01:30:40,470 --> 01:30:41,930
we're the new guys on the block, you know,

2191
01:30:42,020 --> 01:30:44,140
we're trying to make a name for ourselves.

2192
01:30:44,230 --> 01:30:48,850
But I want you to understand, we don't do anything illegal.

2193
01:30:49,650 --> 01:30:50,730
Whatsoever.

2194
01:30:50,820 --> 01:30:52,360
I mean, you could talk to the SEC.

2195
01:30:52,440 --> 01:30:55,490
They were at my office 15 times over the last six months.

2196
01:30:55,570 --> 01:30:58,200
I mean, I got... I got nothing to hide.

2197
01:30:58,280 --> 01:31:01,030
Well, you know the SEC is a civil regulatory agency.

2198
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:02,660
We pursue criminal activities.

2199
01:31:02,740 --> 01:31:05,580
Exactly! You go after real criminals,

2200
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:09,210
which makes me wonder what the hell you're investigating me for?

2201
01:31:09,330 --> 01:31:10,670
I mean, honestly...

2202
01:31:10,750 --> 01:31:13,540
what is it that you think that we did or do?

2203
01:31:13,540 --> 01:31:14,590
I don't get it.

2204
01:31:14,710 --> 01:31:15,970
Well, I...

2205
01:31:16,050 --> 01:31:18,470
Look, Jordan, I can't discuss an ongoing investigation.

2206
01:31:18,550 --> 01:31:20,220
No, I get that. No, I understand.

2207
01:31:20,350 --> 01:31:21,720
With that said...

2208
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:24,430
this case got dumped on my desk...

2209
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:26,350
- Did it? - You know, by a higher-up

2210
01:31:26,430 --> 01:31:27,550
who needs to make a show

2211
01:31:27,550 --> 01:31:29,650
of looking into the new company on the block,

2212
01:31:29,730 --> 01:31:31,190
- with all the press and everything. - New loud guys.

2213
01:31:31,310 --> 01:31:33,930
And then I end up being the schmuck who does the looking.

2214
01:31:33,940 --> 01:31:34,860
Exactly.

2215
01:31:34,940 --> 01:31:36,860
It's just, you know... it bothers me.

2216
01:31:36,950 --> 01:31:37,580
We're the new guy.

2217
01:31:37,580 --> 01:31:39,490
We're the one that's banging on Wall Street's door.

2218
01:31:39,570 --> 01:31:40,660
I mean, you should...

2219
01:31:40,740 --> 01:31:42,660
You should see what's going on at the bigger firms.

2220
01:31:42,740 --> 01:31:44,200
I mean, I know all the information.

2221
01:31:44,370 --> 01:31:47,160
It's true! Goldman, Lehman Brothers, Merrill...

2223
01:31:47,250 --> 01:31:49,250
Collateralized debt obligations?

2224
01:31:49,370 --> 01:31:50,620
This Internet stock bullshit?

2225
01:31:50,710 --> 01:31:52,500
I mean, it's a fucking travesty.

2226
01:31:52,590 --> 01:31:54,830
I could take you step-by-step

2227
01:31:54,830 --> 01:31:57,590
through what exactly is occurring.

2228
01:31:57,840 --> 01:31:59,430
All you have to do is ask.

2229
01:31:59,590 --> 01:32:00,890
I'm available.

2230
01:32:01,050 --> 01:32:02,430
That's exactly what I wanted to hear.

2231
01:32:02,510 --> 01:32:05,390
I don't see why a little sitdown like this

2232
01:32:06,270 --> 01:32:07,810
can't be profitable for the both of us.

2233
01:32:07,930 --> 01:32:08,910
It should. Right?

2234
01:32:08,910 --> 01:32:10,190
It should profit the both of us.

2235
01:32:10,270 --> 01:32:11,770
- It should. - Look.

2236
01:32:12,310 --> 01:32:14,520
I'm gonna give you my personal line.

2237
01:32:14,610 --> 01:32:17,530
Five days a week, you just call me, feel free.

2238
01:32:17,740 --> 01:32:19,450
- I'll do that. - Great.

2239
01:32:22,030 --> 01:32:23,700
Are you sure you guys don't want something to drink?

2240
01:32:23,780 --> 01:32:25,450
You're not hungry? Nothing?

2241
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:27,160
- Nothing? No? - Oh, no.

2242
01:32:30,290 --> 01:32:31,190
Let me ask you,

2243
01:32:31,190 --> 01:32:32,880
and if you don't wanna get too personal,

2244
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:35,250
just tell me to shut up at any time.

2245
01:32:36,130 --> 01:32:38,760
Did you try to get your broker's license at one time?

2246
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:39,760
Did I hear that right?

2247
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:41,680
Were you trying to take a stab at Wall Street?

2248
01:32:42,590 --> 01:32:44,510
- No? - Who you been talking to?

2249
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:45,600
Who the fuck you been talking to?

2250
01:32:45,680 --> 01:32:48,430
Well, you're investigating me. I hear things.

2251
01:32:48,520 --> 01:32:50,600
You know what I mean?

2252
01:32:50,690 --> 01:32:52,270
You ever think about what would've happened

2253
01:32:52,350 --> 01:32:54,810
if you would have stayed the course?

2254
01:32:56,230 --> 01:32:58,070
You know what? When I'm riding home on the subway

2255
01:32:58,150 --> 01:32:59,400
and my balls are fucking sweating,

2256
01:32:59,490 --> 01:33:01,280
I'm wearing the same suit three days in a row...

2257
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:02,860
Yeah, you bet I do.

2258
01:33:02,950 --> 01:33:04,620
I've thought about it before. Who wouldn't, right?

2259
01:33:04,700 --> 01:33:05,740
Right, who fucking wouldn't?

2260
01:33:05,830 --> 01:33:06,990
What do you get...

2261
01:33:07,080 --> 01:33:08,330
Another personal question, no need to answer...

2262
01:33:08,410 --> 01:33:09,790
No, that's all right, Jordan.

2263
01:33:09,870 --> 01:33:12,920
What do you pull in? 50, 60K? Something like that?

2264
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:15,040
A year? In the ballpark?

2265
01:33:15,130 --> 01:33:16,590
Well, I...

2266
01:33:16,670 --> 01:33:18,460
Let's put it this way.

2267
01:33:18,550 --> 01:33:21,340
You get a free handgun when you sign up for the Bureau.

2268
01:33:22,090 --> 01:33:24,220
No, but it fucking pisses me off. You know what I mean?

2269
01:33:24,300 --> 01:33:26,470
You think about the people that built this country,

2270
01:33:26,550 --> 01:33:27,970
hardworking people like you.

2271
01:33:28,060 --> 01:33:30,600
Firefighters, teachers, FBI agents.

2272
01:33:30,730 --> 01:33:31,340
End of the day,

2273
01:33:31,340 --> 01:33:34,400
you guys get fucking skinned alive financially.

2274
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:36,360
It fucking makes me angry.

2275
01:33:36,440 --> 01:33:39,530
Now the one thing about Wall Street and this market is,

2276
01:33:39,610 --> 01:33:41,280
for me, I feel

2277
01:33:42,360 --> 01:33:44,700
it's good to give back. You know, there's...

2278
01:33:44,780 --> 01:33:46,950
There are situations where I can

2279
01:33:47,030 --> 01:33:50,580
make those situations better for people. You know?

2280
01:33:50,660 --> 01:33:51,950
You know what I mean.

2281
01:33:52,040 --> 01:33:53,460
Opportunity

2282
01:33:53,750 --> 01:33:55,000
is everything.

2283
01:33:55,080 --> 01:33:56,330
Exactly.

2284
01:33:56,460 --> 01:33:58,920
Take for example, I got this one kid, right?

2285
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:02,800
Went to school for environmental science, something like that.

2286
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:04,680
He was bogged down by student loans.

2287
01:34:04,760 --> 01:34:07,470
Turns out, his mother needed triple bypass surgery.

2288
01:34:07,550 --> 01:34:08,970
- Jesus. - Right. Horrible situation.

2289
01:34:09,060 --> 01:34:10,010
Sure.

2290
01:34:10,100 --> 01:34:11,180
But we got him into the market

2291
01:34:11,270 --> 01:34:12,980
at the right time and chose the right stock.

2292
01:34:13,060 --> 01:34:14,810
We gave him the right guidance.

2293
01:34:14,890 --> 01:34:18,060
Boom! Overnight, changed his entire life.

2294
01:34:18,190 --> 01:34:21,530
Got to put his mother into the best hospital in New York City.

2295
01:34:21,610 --> 01:34:22,770
It didn't work out for her,

2296
01:34:22,770 --> 01:34:24,490
granted, she passed away, unfortunately.

2297
01:34:24,570 --> 01:34:26,490
But we gave him that opportunity.

2298
01:34:26,570 --> 01:34:27,740
You know what I'm saying?

2299
01:34:28,450 --> 01:34:30,760
It's just about setting up the right team,

2300
01:34:30,760 --> 01:34:32,950
and then overnight your life can change.

2301
01:34:38,340 --> 01:34:40,750
What does... What does an intern...

2302
01:34:42,300 --> 01:34:44,170
What does an intern make in a deal like that?

2303
01:34:44,260 --> 01:34:46,300
Well, in that situation,

2304
01:34:47,220 --> 01:34:50,260
in that particular trade, and it was one trade,

2305
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:53,100
north of half a million dollars.

2306
01:34:56,730 --> 01:34:58,980
And I'd do that for anybody, you know,

2307
01:34:59,060 --> 01:35:01,730
anybody that needs the proper guidance.

2308
01:35:21,540 --> 01:35:25,630
Can you say that again, just the way you said it?

2309
01:35:26,050 --> 01:35:27,760
Just the same way.

2310
01:35:31,970 --> 01:35:33,060
I don't know what you're talking about.

2311
01:35:33,140 --> 01:35:35,390
Oh, come on! You know what I'm talking about.

2312
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:37,480
I think what Jordan just did is he...

2313
01:35:37,560 --> 01:35:38,690
- If I'm not mistaken... - No.

2314
01:35:38,770 --> 01:35:40,900
...you just tried to bribe a federal officer.

2315
01:35:40,980 --> 01:35:43,070
No, technically I didn't bribe anybody.

2316
01:35:43,150 --> 01:35:45,570
No, no, that's not the conversation I heard, Jordan.

2317
01:35:45,650 --> 01:35:47,150
No, no, according to the U.S. criminal code,

2318
01:35:47,240 --> 01:35:48,530
there needs to be an exact

2319
01:35:48,530 --> 01:35:50,660
dollar figure for the exchange of services.

2320
01:35:50,740 --> 01:35:52,370
That would not hold up in a court of law.

2321
01:35:52,450 --> 01:35:54,120
Nah, it's not how I heard it.

2322
01:35:54,200 --> 01:35:55,620
No, no, no, that's the truth.

2323
01:35:55,620 --> 01:35:56,910
But I want to tell you this.

2324
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:58,000
Yeah.

2325
01:35:58,080 --> 01:35:59,580
The same gentleman that told me

2326
01:35:59,670 --> 01:36:01,420
that you tried to get your broker's license

2327
01:36:01,500 --> 01:36:03,630
also told me that you are a straight arrow.

2328
01:36:03,750 --> 01:36:05,210
He ran a security check on me.

2329
01:36:05,300 --> 01:36:06,510
Well...

2330
01:36:06,630 --> 01:36:08,380
Yeah, when you sail on a boat

2331
01:36:08,380 --> 01:36:09,590
fit for a Bond villain,

2332
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:12,340
sometimes you need to play the part. Right?

2333
01:36:13,140 --> 01:36:15,060
I think it's time you both get the fuck off my boat.

2334
01:36:15,180 --> 01:36:16,430
What do you say?

2335
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:18,770
You know, Jordan, I'll tell you something.

2336
01:36:18,850 --> 01:36:21,850
Most of the Wall Street jackasses that I bust,

2337
01:36:22,270 --> 01:36:24,610
they're to the manor born.

2338
01:36:24,690 --> 01:36:25,770
- Is that right? - Yeah.

2339
01:36:25,860 --> 01:36:27,480
Their fathers are douchebags,

2340
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:29,490
just like their fathers before them.

2341
01:36:30,610 --> 01:36:32,030
But you...

2342
01:36:33,740 --> 01:36:36,030
You, Jordan, you got this way all on your own.

2343
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:37,370
Did I?

2344
01:36:37,450 --> 01:36:39,540
- Good for you, little man. - Little man?

2345
01:36:39,660 --> 01:36:40,910
Good for you.

2346
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:42,170
Me, the little man?

2347
01:36:42,250 --> 01:36:43,290
And let me tell you something.

2348
01:36:43,380 --> 01:36:45,210
Let me tell you something else.

2349
01:36:45,340 --> 01:36:47,500
Honestly, I'm not bullshitting here,

2350
01:36:47,670 --> 01:36:48,800
this is one of the nicest boats

2351
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:50,880
- that I've ever been on, I gotta tell you. - I bet it is.

2352
01:36:50,970 --> 01:36:52,380
And you know what I was just thinking, too?

2353
01:36:52,510 --> 01:36:55,760
The fucking hero that I'm gonna be back at the office

2354
01:36:55,890 --> 01:36:58,060
when the Bureau seizes this fucking boat.

2355
01:36:58,180 --> 01:37:00,350
Because, I mean, fuckety-fuck-fuck, Jordan,

2356
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:01,730
look at this thing!

2357
01:37:02,100 --> 01:37:03,150
It's beautiful!

2358
01:37:03,230 --> 01:37:06,190
And you got the beautiful girls there. It's wonderful.

2359
01:37:06,270 --> 01:37:08,730
All right, get the fuck off my boat.

2360
01:37:08,900 --> 01:37:10,440
I'm sure we'll be seeing each other

2361
01:37:10,530 --> 01:37:11,570
- real soon. - I'm sure.

2362
01:37:11,650 --> 01:37:12,810
Good luck on that subway

2363
01:37:12,810 --> 01:37:15,120
ride home to your miserable, ugly fucking wives.

2364
01:37:15,200 --> 01:37:16,370
I'm gonna have Heidi lick

2365
01:37:16,370 --> 01:37:18,290
some caviar off my balls in the meantime.

2366
01:37:18,410 --> 01:37:21,040
Hey, you guys want to take some lobsters for your ride home?

2367
01:37:21,120 --> 01:37:23,750
Fucking miserable pricks, I know you can't afford them!

2368
01:37:23,830 --> 01:37:25,920
Fucking cheap fucks.

2369
01:37:26,090 --> 01:37:28,050
Fucking miserable pricks.

2370
01:37:28,130 --> 01:37:31,340
Hey, fellas! Look what I found in my pocket! Look!

2371
01:37:31,630 --> 01:37:33,380
A year's salary right here.

2372
01:37:33,470 --> 01:37:36,140
You know what I call them? Fun coupons!

2373
01:37:36,220 --> 01:37:37,470
See that!

2374
01:37:38,010 --> 01:37:40,020
They're fun coupons!

2375
01:37:47,820 --> 01:37:50,570
Switzerland? What the fuck is in Switzerland?

2376
01:37:50,690 --> 01:37:52,690
Swiss fucking banks, that's what.

2377
01:37:52,780 --> 01:37:55,450
It was ass-covering time. I had to hide my money.

2378
01:37:56,740 --> 01:37:58,280
Enter Rugrat.

2379
01:37:58,410 --> 01:38:00,040
He knew this Swiss banker from law school.

2380
01:38:00,120 --> 01:38:01,160
That's for European pussy!

2381
01:38:01,250 --> 01:38:02,500
But he was in Geneva.

2382
01:38:02,580 --> 01:38:04,960
And there was no way I was gonna make that flight sober.

2383
01:38:06,790 --> 01:38:08,420
So I knew if I took my drugs right,

2384
01:38:08,500 --> 01:38:10,550
I could sleep through the entire flight.

2385
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:13,300
But I had to take them just right.

2386
01:38:13,930 --> 01:38:15,970
At 4:00 P.M., I popped a few more ludes,

2387
01:38:16,050 --> 01:38:17,510
which started kicking in by the time

2388
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:19,350
I finished my sales meeting.

2389
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:20,810
My tingle phase.

2390
01:38:21,140 --> 01:38:22,810
By dinner, I popped a few more

2391
01:38:22,890 --> 01:38:25,810
on top of some cocktails and a Valium or two.

2392
01:38:25,980 --> 01:38:27,480
My slur phase.

2393
01:38:29,650 --> 01:38:31,980
By 8:30, I took a few more ludes

2394
01:38:32,190 --> 01:38:34,780
and pretty much lost all my motor skills.

2395
01:38:35,030 --> 01:38:36,530
This was the drool phase.

2396
01:38:39,580 --> 01:38:42,950
By 10:00, I didn't know who or what the fuck I was.

2397
01:38:43,040 --> 01:38:44,620
The amnesia phase.

2398
01:38:45,540 --> 01:38:47,500
We boarded the plane just before midnight.

2399
01:38:47,580 --> 01:38:49,290
Wow! Look at you!

2400
01:38:49,380 --> 01:38:51,340
- You're beautiful. - Excuse me, sir.

2401
01:38:51,550 --> 01:38:53,710
His sleeping pills just kicked in. He's all right.

2402
01:38:53,800 --> 01:38:55,340
May I see your boarding passes, sir?

2403
01:38:55,430 --> 01:38:57,180
We have the boarding passes.

2404
01:38:57,300 --> 01:38:59,300
Jesus Christ, I wanna fuck her.

2405
01:38:59,930 --> 01:39:01,640
Hey! Fucking relax.

2406
01:39:01,850 --> 01:39:03,890
Oh, my God! You got your hand on my fucking cock!

2407
01:39:03,980 --> 01:39:05,350
Cut it out.

2408
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:06,440
He's got his hand on my dick again.

2409
01:39:06,520 --> 01:39:07,520
I'm just trying to buckle you up.

2410
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:08,810
You got your hand on his dick?

2411
01:39:08,900 --> 01:39:10,860
You gotta stop doing that in public places.

2412
01:39:10,940 --> 01:39:12,900
Oh, my God. Take it off!

2413
01:39:13,190 --> 01:39:14,190
Take it off!

2414
01:39:14,280 --> 01:39:16,990
I heard there's a treasure map under here.

2415
01:39:17,110 --> 01:39:18,380
Stop!

2416
01:39:18,390 --> 01:39:19,660
- Excuse me, sir. - I know, miss.

2417
01:39:19,740 --> 01:39:21,240
Please sit down.

2418
01:39:21,330 --> 01:39:22,780
- Watch it. - Go back to your seat, please.

2419
01:39:22,870 --> 01:39:25,160
- What are you upset about? - Please go back to your seat.

2420
01:39:25,250 --> 01:39:27,120
I will have to call the captain.

2421
01:39:27,210 --> 01:39:29,710
Please, sir, please, sir. Sit down.

2422
01:39:29,790 --> 01:39:31,460
Please sit down!

2423
01:39:31,540 --> 01:39:33,130
- I'm going! Stop. - Okay, sorry.

2424
01:39:33,210 --> 01:39:34,840
We apologize. We're gonna go to sleep.

2425
01:39:34,920 --> 01:39:36,130
Question. I wanna ask you a question.

2426
01:39:36,220 --> 01:39:37,760
Fasten your seat belt, sir.

2427
01:39:38,380 --> 01:39:39,930
We cannot take off if you haven't fastened

2428
01:39:40,010 --> 01:39:41,050
- your seat belt. - I'm really horny, too.

2429
01:39:41,140 --> 01:39:42,260
Sit down. Fasten it.

2430
01:39:42,350 --> 01:39:43,850
- Right. Okay, I'll sit down... - I will do it for you.

2431
01:39:43,930 --> 01:39:44,930
- What? - I'll do it for you.

2432
01:39:45,020 --> 01:39:46,180
You gotta speak English.

2433
01:39:46,270 --> 01:39:48,230
We don't understand this language you're speaking.

2434
01:39:48,310 --> 01:39:49,810
I will help him with his seat belt.

2435
01:39:51,060 --> 01:39:53,020
- You gotta put it on right. - Sit back. Sit back, sir.

2436
01:39:53,230 --> 01:39:55,230
- There you go. - All right. I'll just lean back...

2437
01:39:57,570 --> 01:39:59,240
Bitte, Hilfe!

2438
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:00,700
- Hilfe! - Hilfe!

2439
01:40:14,500 --> 01:40:15,810
Jesus Christ!

2440
01:40:15,880 --> 01:40:17,260
Fuck!

2441
01:40:18,930 --> 01:40:20,300
Donnie...

2442
01:40:20,430 --> 01:40:23,510
Donnie, this isn't funny. You gotta untie me, buddy.

2443
01:40:24,140 --> 01:40:25,850
I can't untie you.

2444
01:40:25,930 --> 01:40:28,770
The captain tied you up. He almost fucking tasered you.

2445
01:40:29,730 --> 01:40:32,150
Why?

2446
01:40:41,110 --> 01:40:42,910
it's not you, sweetheart, don't beat yourself up.

2447
01:40:43,200 --> 01:40:45,950
Easy, easy. He's fine. He's just a nervous flyer.

2448
01:40:46,120 --> 01:40:48,290
You were screaming at people.

2449
01:40:48,370 --> 01:40:49,750
Oh, fuck off.

2450
01:40:49,830 --> 01:40:51,960
You were on the floor rolling around and shit.

2451
01:40:52,040 --> 01:40:53,080
Oh, Jesus.

2452
01:40:53,170 --> 01:40:55,250
You called the captain the N-word.

2453
01:40:55,340 --> 01:40:56,840
I called the captain the N-word?

2454
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:59,170
- Yeah, he was very upset. - Really?

2455
01:40:59,300 --> 01:41:01,630
- Luckily we're in first class. - Jesus.

2456
01:41:02,470 --> 01:41:05,300
Jesus Christ, I think you have a fucking drug problem.

2457
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:09,020
Where are the ludes? Where are the ludes?

2458
01:41:10,060 --> 01:41:11,560
They're up my ass. Don't worry about it.

2459
01:41:11,640 --> 01:41:13,230
- I got it. - Okay.

2460
01:41:13,310 --> 01:41:14,900
Thank God.

2461
01:41:15,360 --> 01:41:16,260
Jesus Christ, what are we

2462
01:41:16,260 --> 01:41:17,820
gonna do when we get to Switzerland, buddy?

2463
01:41:17,940 --> 01:41:18,940
This is bad.

2464
01:41:19,030 --> 01:41:21,360
Fucking things are against my chest. I can't breathe.

2465
01:41:21,490 --> 01:41:23,240
Come on, do something to calm me down. Please.

2466
01:41:23,320 --> 01:41:25,030
Okay, shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.

2467
01:41:25,620 --> 01:41:26,700
Okay.

2468
01:41:28,330 --> 01:41:29,580
- That's good. - Go to sleep.

2469
01:41:29,660 --> 01:41:30,790
Rub it harder, buddy.

2470
01:41:30,910 --> 01:41:32,500
You're all right.

2471
01:41:32,870 --> 01:41:35,170
We all love you. Shut the fuck up!

2472
01:41:41,010 --> 01:41:43,880
Mr. Belfort, you're free to go.

2473
01:41:46,010 --> 01:41:47,180
Really?

2474
01:41:51,230 --> 01:41:52,350
- Hey, Donnie. - Yeah?

2475
01:41:52,440 --> 01:41:53,940
When we get out there, try not to act like yourself.

2476
01:41:54,020 --> 01:41:56,310
Okay? Let's make Geneva an asshole-free Donnie zone, all right?

2477
01:41:56,400 --> 01:41:57,810
What are you fucking coming at me for?

2478
01:41:57,900 --> 01:41:59,440
Hey, listen. The only reason you're sitting in this limo

2479
01:41:59,530 --> 01:42:01,110
and not in a Swiss jail is because of my friend. Okay?

2480
01:42:01,190 --> 01:42:02,360
Hilfe!

2481
01:42:03,320 --> 01:42:05,740
- We're here. We're here. - Everyone calm down.

2482
01:42:06,240 --> 01:42:07,660
Jordan Belfort!

2483
01:42:07,740 --> 01:42:08,990
At last.

2484
01:42:09,080 --> 01:42:11,660
Nicholas has told me so much about you.

2485
01:42:11,750 --> 01:42:13,620
Jordan, Jean Jacques Saurel.

2486
01:42:13,870 --> 01:42:16,250
- Pleasure to make your acquaintance. - Nice to meet you.

2487
01:42:16,830 --> 01:42:18,040
It's a joke.

2488
01:42:18,170 --> 01:42:20,420
You'll understand when you're in the fucking seat.

2489
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:22,380
You need a bigger couch. For guests.

2490
01:42:22,470 --> 01:42:24,170
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I don't understand. I'm sorry.

2491
01:42:24,260 --> 01:42:27,090
I'm curious about your bank secrecy laws here.

2492
01:42:28,720 --> 01:42:31,890
Wait. Yes. Excusez-moi, Jordan.

2493
01:42:32,480 --> 01:42:35,520
Swiss custom requires 10 minutes of...

2494
01:42:35,650 --> 01:42:36,650
Blah, blah, blah.

2495
01:42:36,730 --> 01:42:38,360
- Chit chat. - Yeah, chit chat, thank you.

2496
01:42:38,440 --> 01:42:40,070
...before business can be discussed.

2497
01:42:41,610 --> 01:42:42,730
Yeah.

2498
01:42:45,530 --> 01:42:46,570
Of course.

2499
01:42:47,240 --> 01:42:50,030
Let's get down to it. What would you like to know?

2500
01:42:50,580 --> 01:42:53,450
Under what circumstances would you be obligated

2501
01:42:53,540 --> 01:42:55,710
to cooperate with an FBI

2502
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:59,170
or a U.S. Justice Department investigation, for example?

2503
01:42:59,790 --> 01:43:00,960
Ca depend.

2504
01:43:01,590 --> 01:43:02,710
Ca depend?

2505
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:03,800
Oui.

2506
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:07,550
Ca depend on what, exactly?

2507
01:43:08,340 --> 01:43:10,600
Whether America plans to invade Switzerland

2508
01:43:10,680 --> 01:43:12,260
in the coming months.

2509
01:43:12,720 --> 01:43:14,930
Shall I check if tanks are rolling down the Rue de la Croy?

2510
01:43:15,020 --> 01:43:17,100
- Yes. Rue de la Croix. - Croix. Croix.

2511
01:43:17,190 --> 01:43:20,020
Not Croy. Not Rue de la Croy. It's Croix.

2512
01:43:20,230 --> 01:43:22,440
See, this is what he used to do back in law school. Check me.

2513
01:43:22,530 --> 01:43:24,280
- Champagne. Champagne. - Yeah.

2514
01:43:24,360 --> 01:43:26,740
Yeah, yeah. French fries, pommes frites.

2515
01:43:27,490 --> 01:43:30,030
- And that kind of stuff. - That's funny.

2516
01:43:31,450 --> 01:43:33,930
What I'm asking, you Swiss dick,

2517
01:43:33,940 --> 01:43:36,500
is are you going to fuck me over?

2518
01:43:39,130 --> 01:43:42,790
I understand perfectly, you American shit.

2519
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:47,340
The only way the Banque Real de Geneve

2520
01:43:47,430 --> 01:43:49,510
would cooperate with a foreign legal body

2521
01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:53,760
is if the crime being pursued is also a crime in Switzerland.

2522
01:43:53,890 --> 01:43:58,440
But there are very few Swiss laws which apply to your practices.

2523
01:43:59,650 --> 01:44:01,270
From a financial standpoint,

2524
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:04,440
you are now in heaven.

2525
01:44:04,610 --> 01:44:06,480
See, I told you he was fantastic, right?

2526
01:44:07,240 --> 01:44:08,560
If the U.S. Justice

2527
01:44:08,570 --> 01:44:11,780
Department sent us a subpoena, it would become

2528
01:44:12,240 --> 01:44:13,870
papier toilette.

2529
01:44:14,740 --> 01:44:17,000
We would wipe our ass with it.

2530
01:44:17,660 --> 01:44:20,250
Unless, of course, it was an investigation

2531
01:44:20,330 --> 01:44:22,170
into stock fraud,

2532
01:44:22,250 --> 01:44:24,420
which is a crime here in Switzerland, if I'm correct.

2533
01:44:24,500 --> 01:44:28,510
Then there would have to be cooperation on your part,

2534
01:44:28,630 --> 01:44:30,590
- if I'm not mistaken. - Yes.

2535
01:44:30,760 --> 01:44:33,180
Yes, we would.

2536
01:44:33,350 --> 01:44:35,890
Assuming the account is under your name.

2537
01:44:37,100 --> 01:44:40,140
If it were another name,

2538
01:44:41,350 --> 01:44:42,980
a friend's, camarade...

2539
01:44:43,060 --> 01:44:44,150
Cousin?

2540
01:44:44,150 --> 01:44:45,230
Cousin, absolute.

2541
01:44:48,900 --> 01:44:50,610
- Relative? - Yeah.

2542
01:44:52,820 --> 01:44:55,450
Was that yodeling I just heard

2543
01:44:55,580 --> 01:44:58,040
or did you just say what I thought you said?

2544
01:44:58,120 --> 01:44:59,870
Yes. Yes.

2545
01:45:00,620 --> 01:45:03,170
He's telling me to use a fucking rathole.

2546
01:45:03,380 --> 01:45:05,040
But a U.S. rathole would never get

2547
01:45:05,130 --> 01:45:07,340
into Switzerland with all that money.

2548
01:45:07,420 --> 01:45:11,260
What I needed was a rathole with a European passport.

2549
01:45:18,560 --> 01:45:19,980
Jordan.

2550
01:45:20,060 --> 01:45:22,940
Hey. How's my favorite aunt, huh?

2551
01:45:23,020 --> 01:45:24,440
Welcome. Was the traffic terrible?

2552
01:45:24,520 --> 01:45:26,060
Oh, no, not at all.

2553
01:45:28,610 --> 01:45:30,240
Jordan, come in.

2554
01:45:30,400 --> 01:45:32,900
Thank God Aunt Emma didn't need too much convincing.

2555
01:45:33,570 --> 01:45:36,070
Turned out the British weren't too different from the Swiss.

2556
01:45:36,240 --> 01:45:38,740
Money talks and bullshit takes the bus.

2557
01:45:39,200 --> 01:45:41,120
How do you say "Rathole" In British?

2558
01:45:41,540 --> 01:45:44,000
If you get into any trouble whatsoever,

2559
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:46,840
I'll come forth immediately. I'll say that I duped you.

2560
01:45:46,920 --> 01:45:48,210
That I promise.

2561
01:45:48,920 --> 01:45:51,590
Risk is what keeps us young, isn't it, darling?

2562
01:45:55,930 --> 01:45:57,720
Sometimes I wonder

2563
01:45:58,010 --> 01:46:01,020
if you let money get the best of you, my love.

2564
01:46:01,140 --> 01:46:04,270
Among other substances.

2565
01:46:08,690 --> 01:46:10,070
It's that obvious, huh?

2566
01:46:10,150 --> 01:46:13,400
It's chilly, darling, and you're sweating bullets.

2567
01:46:16,120 --> 01:46:17,950
What can I say? I'm...

2568
01:46:18,830 --> 01:46:20,490
I'm a drug addict.

2569
01:46:20,620 --> 01:46:21,950
I really am.

2570
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:24,750
Cocaine, pills,

2571
01:46:25,250 --> 01:46:27,670
whatever it is, I'll fucking do it.

2572
01:46:28,210 --> 01:46:29,920
Now that's the truth.

2573
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:31,250
I mean...

2574
01:46:31,340 --> 01:46:32,710
I'm a sex addict, too.

2575
01:46:33,630 --> 01:46:36,050
Well, there are worse things to be addicted to than sex.

2576
01:46:37,340 --> 01:46:39,720
Jesus, why am I telling you all this? Why am I...

2577
01:46:39,810 --> 01:46:41,430
I'm sorry.

2578
01:46:42,180 --> 01:46:44,390
Because I'm very easy to talk to.

2579
01:46:44,770 --> 01:46:47,480
You are. You are easy to talk to.

2580
01:46:48,650 --> 01:46:50,070
I suppose it's...

2581
01:46:50,150 --> 01:46:51,570
Just my job, you know.

2582
01:46:52,820 --> 01:46:54,780
All these people dependent on me.

2583
01:46:54,860 --> 01:46:57,570
Tens of millions of dollars at stake, you know.

2584
01:46:57,660 --> 01:46:59,370
Sometimes I feel like I...

2585
01:46:59,450 --> 01:47:02,620
I've bitten off more than I can chew, you know.

2586
01:47:02,830 --> 01:47:05,120
You're a man with large appetites.

2587
01:47:05,290 --> 01:47:06,370
Yeah.

2588
01:47:08,080 --> 01:47:10,000
Is she fucking hitting on me?

2589
01:47:10,340 --> 01:47:11,380
Yeah.

2590
01:47:11,500 --> 01:47:12,800
Yeah, I am.

2591
01:47:15,170 --> 01:47:18,510
I suppose I put that on myself though, right?

2592
01:47:18,840 --> 01:47:20,390
My decision.

2593
01:47:20,890 --> 01:47:22,350
It's just hard to...

2594
01:47:22,430 --> 01:47:26,350
Hard to learn to control the anxiety sometimes, you know?

2595
01:47:26,940 --> 01:47:28,480
You know, to...

2596
01:47:28,690 --> 01:47:31,360
learn to relax and let go and...

2597
01:47:32,360 --> 01:47:34,360
to release the tension.

2598
01:47:35,400 --> 01:47:36,860
She is hitting on me.

2599
01:47:37,820 --> 01:47:39,240
Holy shit!

2600
01:47:39,530 --> 01:47:41,780
Yeah, to release the tension.

2601
01:47:45,620 --> 01:47:47,370
I suppose we...

2602
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:50,250
We all just need to learn...

2603
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:54,170
learn to do what comes naturally in life, you know?

2604
01:47:56,090 --> 01:47:58,550
Is he fucking hitting on me?

2605
01:48:04,770 --> 01:48:06,430
Stability, dear.

2606
01:48:06,520 --> 01:48:07,930
Family.

2607
01:48:14,570 --> 01:48:16,730
You take care of my niece, my love.

2608
01:48:16,820 --> 01:48:19,360
I'll take care of everything over here.

2609
01:48:20,320 --> 01:48:21,410
Deal.

2610
01:48:23,950 --> 01:48:26,120
Come on! There you go.

2611
01:48:28,160 --> 01:48:31,420
We had, literally, a fuckload of money.

2612
01:48:31,920 --> 01:48:33,920
Aunt Emma could never carry all this by herself.

2613
01:48:34,750 --> 01:48:38,420
So I thought to myself, who else has a European passport?

2614
01:48:38,590 --> 01:48:40,510
Brad, you're making this too fucking tight!

2615
01:48:40,590 --> 01:48:43,390
Now Brad, as a successful drug dealer,

2616
01:48:43,470 --> 01:48:45,680
spent his winters in the south of France,

2617
01:48:45,760 --> 01:48:47,810
which is where he met his wife, Chantalle,

2618
01:48:47,890 --> 01:48:50,770
a stripper of Slovenian origin

2619
01:48:50,940 --> 01:48:52,350
born, in of all places,

2620
01:48:52,940 --> 01:48:54,440
Switzerland.

2621
01:48:58,610 --> 01:49:00,280
Well, this is fucked.

2622
01:49:01,320 --> 01:49:02,780
No shit.

2623
01:49:06,290 --> 01:49:08,750
Like, this will take her like 50 trips.

2624
01:49:08,830 --> 01:49:10,040
I know.

2625
01:49:13,750 --> 01:49:14,960
Let me ask you something?

2626
01:49:15,090 --> 01:49:17,670
What about her family? Right?

2627
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:20,420
I mean, they all got Swiss passports, right.

2628
01:49:20,510 --> 01:49:22,380
She's got parents, she's got a brother, right?

2629
01:49:22,470 --> 01:49:24,390
The brother's got a wife. That's five fucking people.

2630
01:49:24,470 --> 01:49:26,390
Six, seven trips, boom, right?

2631
01:49:26,470 --> 01:49:28,060
They're all fucking Swiss nitwits like her.

2632
01:49:28,140 --> 01:49:29,390
- They'll do it. - We could do that.

2633
01:49:29,480 --> 01:49:31,940
At least I have a family, you crooked-nose fuck!

2634
01:49:32,020 --> 01:49:34,850
Hey, don't forget about my money.

2635
01:49:36,650 --> 01:49:37,730
I'm sorry, what's that?

2636
01:49:37,820 --> 01:49:39,280
Yeah, I forgot to tell you. He's got some...

2637
01:49:39,360 --> 01:49:41,400
- He's got some money. - My money.

2638
01:49:41,780 --> 01:49:43,990
I got a couple of mil coming in like a week.

2639
01:49:44,070 --> 01:49:46,660
When it gets in, I'll give you a call, you come pick it up.

2640
01:49:49,290 --> 01:49:50,700
You give me a call?

2641
01:49:52,330 --> 01:49:53,220
When it gets here,

2642
01:49:53,220 --> 01:49:55,580
I'll give you a call and you'll come pick it up.

2643
01:49:55,670 --> 01:49:57,460
Well, we don't fucking work for you, man!

2644
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,960
Sweetheart, you have my money taped to your tits.

2645
01:50:01,050 --> 01:50:03,050
Okay? Technically, you do work for me.

2646
01:50:06,100 --> 01:50:07,680
Hey, Jordan, we're gonna need to talk.

2647
01:50:07,930 --> 01:50:09,430
If I fucking do this, I'm telling you right now,

2648
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:10,470
I ain't going to him, okay.

2649
01:50:10,560 --> 01:50:11,600
- I'm not a fucking shvartze. - I got it.

2650
01:50:11,680 --> 01:50:12,980
I don't do fucking pickups, all right?

2651
01:50:13,060 --> 01:50:14,100
- I got it. - Well, listen to me.

2652
01:50:14,190 --> 01:50:15,770
We meet someplace that I fucking say.

2653
01:50:15,850 --> 01:50:17,230
And you tell that fucking piece of shit,

2654
01:50:17,310 --> 01:50:18,480
- he comes correct. - I will.

2655
01:50:18,570 --> 01:50:20,860
He comes in all fucking loopy and fucked up, I swear to God

2656
01:50:20,940 --> 01:50:22,780
I'll mash that douchebag's teeth in.

2657
01:50:22,860 --> 01:50:24,610
You're gonna mash whose fucking teeth in?

2658
01:50:24,700 --> 01:50:26,410
Whose fucking teeth are you gonna mash in?

2659
01:50:26,490 --> 01:50:28,780
I put the money on that fucking table! Not you!

2660
01:50:28,870 --> 01:50:30,700
I'm the reason we have this whole fucking deal!

2661
01:50:30,790 --> 01:50:32,790
- He's got a gun, you fucking idiot! - Fuck his gun!

2662
01:50:32,870 --> 01:50:34,250
I put that money in there!

2663
01:50:34,330 --> 01:50:35,710
You know what? You're a fucking pill dealer.

2664
01:50:35,790 --> 01:50:38,080
I got five more just like you, bro.

2665
01:50:38,170 --> 01:50:39,880
Keep talking, you fucking piece of shit!

2666
01:50:39,960 --> 01:50:41,710
You know what else? You dress like shit!

2667
01:50:41,800 --> 01:50:42,800
So fuck you!

2668
01:50:42,880 --> 01:50:44,630
- Fucking motherfucker! - Oh! Jesus!

2669
01:50:44,720 --> 01:50:46,550
How about that, faggot? Who's a faggot?

2670
01:50:46,680 --> 01:50:48,470
You okay? Hey, pal.

2671
01:50:51,180 --> 01:50:53,980
The next day, Aunt Emma flew to Geneva.

2672
01:50:54,060 --> 01:50:56,390
Two million in cash in her carry-on,

2673
01:50:56,480 --> 01:50:59,440
which in the big picture was a drop in the Swiss bucket.

2674
01:51:00,690 --> 01:51:01,980
'Cause the following month,

2675
01:51:02,070 --> 01:51:03,940
over the course of six round trips,

2676
01:51:04,030 --> 01:51:05,400
Chantalle's family and

2677
01:51:05,400 --> 01:51:08,070
friends smuggled in over 20 million in cash

2678
01:51:08,160 --> 01:51:09,910
without even a hiccup.

2679
01:51:14,910 --> 01:51:16,830
- And I have some more. - Really?

2680
01:51:16,920 --> 01:51:18,120
- Here. - Oh, thank you.

2681
01:51:18,210 --> 01:51:19,330
And here.

2682
01:51:19,420 --> 01:51:21,420
- Welcome. - Welcome?

2683
01:51:21,500 --> 01:51:23,760
Yeah, like four bags of it.

2684
01:51:25,380 --> 01:51:27,720
Are you Swiss-Slovakian or Swiss-Slovenian?

2685
01:51:27,800 --> 01:51:29,340
- Slovenian. - Slovenian?

2686
01:51:29,430 --> 01:51:30,640
Who cares. You're blonde.

2687
01:51:30,720 --> 01:51:31,720
Oh, stop.

2688
01:51:52,580 --> 01:51:53,700
Shit.

2689
01:51:53,790 --> 01:51:55,040
Just put the fucking car in park,

2690
01:51:55,120 --> 01:51:56,910
you dumb fucking idiot!

2691
01:51:58,460 --> 01:52:00,080
I can't close this briefcase.

2692
01:52:00,170 --> 01:52:01,540
One fucking day.

2693
01:52:01,630 --> 01:52:03,590
One fucking day, you couldn't keep it together?

2694
01:52:03,670 --> 01:52:05,250
I'm fucked up, Brad.

2695
01:52:05,800 --> 01:52:08,420
- Gotta be fucking kidding me. - Fucked up.

2696
01:52:13,260 --> 01:52:14,760
- It's a joke. - It's a joke?

2697
01:52:14,850 --> 01:52:16,810
- I'm sober. - Jesus fucking Christ!

2698
01:52:16,890 --> 01:52:17,890
It's a fucking joke.

2699
01:52:17,980 --> 01:52:19,560
- Are you fucking stupid? - I'm not stupid.

2700
01:52:19,650 --> 01:52:21,100
You fucking drive in here like a fucking maniac,

2701
01:52:21,190 --> 01:52:23,020
you know the attention that that fucking draws?

2702
01:52:23,110 --> 01:52:25,780
- I'm not stupid. I'm smart. - Smart?

2703
01:52:25,860 --> 01:52:27,940
- I make million-dollar deals. - That right.

2704
01:52:28,030 --> 01:52:30,410
With smart important people, unlike you.

2705
01:52:30,490 --> 01:52:34,370
People who don't sucker-punch people when they're scared. Okay?

2706
01:52:34,450 --> 01:52:35,830
- I'm scared, huh? - And by the way,

2707
01:52:35,910 --> 01:52:36,910
I haven't gotten an apology yet for that.

2708
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:38,040
You want an apology, okay.

2709
01:52:38,120 --> 01:52:39,540
I check my fucking messages every day

2710
01:52:39,620 --> 01:52:40,580
- when I come home from work. - Did you?

2711
01:52:40,670 --> 01:52:41,920
- My answering machine. Zero. - Didn't get one, huh?

2712
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:43,040
I got a blinking light,

2713
01:52:43,130 --> 01:52:44,420
because I don't have shit from you.

2714
01:52:44,500 --> 01:52:45,710
You know what, you got a big fucking mouth, okay?

2715
01:52:45,800 --> 01:52:47,050
I got my wife checking the messages

2716
01:52:47,130 --> 01:52:49,130
every 45 minutes calling the office, saying,

2717
01:52:49,220 --> 01:52:50,430
"Has Brad apologized yet?"

2718
01:52:50,510 --> 01:52:52,510
"Is there an apology message on the machine?"

2719
01:52:52,590 --> 01:52:54,140
I don't have jack shit. You know what?

2720
01:52:54,220 --> 01:52:55,640
That's not how you treat people.

2721
01:52:55,720 --> 01:52:56,760
You got a big fucking mouth, you know.

2722
01:52:56,850 --> 01:52:58,520
I'm gonna give you a fucking pass. Just give me the case.

2723
01:52:58,600 --> 01:53:00,810
You're gonna give me a pass?

2724
01:53:00,890 --> 01:53:02,480
Look, it's a figure of fucking speech.

2725
01:53:02,560 --> 01:53:04,520
Oh, my gosh. The Emperor of Fucksville

2726
01:53:04,610 --> 01:53:05,900
came down from Fucksville to give me a pass!

2727
01:53:05,980 --> 01:53:06,980
From Fucksville, huh?

2728
01:53:07,070 --> 01:53:08,940
Hey, what are the citizens of Fucksville doing today

2729
01:53:09,030 --> 01:53:10,490
when their Emperor's gone?

2730
01:53:10,570 --> 01:53:12,110
Is it mayhem?

2731
01:53:12,200 --> 01:53:13,990
Are people looting and raping?

2732
01:53:14,070 --> 01:53:16,080
What are all the little fuckheads doing while you're here?

2733
01:53:16,160 --> 01:53:17,580
Go fuck yourself! Give me the bag.

2734
01:53:17,660 --> 01:53:18,950
You back the fuck up.

2735
01:53:19,040 --> 01:53:20,160
I'll cause the biggest

2736
01:53:20,160 --> 01:53:22,500
fucking scene that I've ever caused in my life

2737
01:53:22,580 --> 01:53:24,330
if you come at me again.

2738
01:53:24,420 --> 01:53:26,000
- You know what? - Just fucking keep it down.

2739
01:53:26,090 --> 01:53:27,300
I got...

2740
01:53:27,380 --> 01:53:29,640
I don't wanna be out of line or anything,

2741
01:53:29,650 --> 01:53:31,970
but I think you like, like me. Like you...

2742
01:53:32,050 --> 01:53:33,510
Like when you come at me...

2743
01:53:33,590 --> 01:53:34,680
What's the matter with you? What the fuck is...

2744
01:53:34,760 --> 01:53:36,180
...and you look at me. I swear I just noticed it.

2745
01:53:36,260 --> 01:53:37,970
You have like a fucking, like...

2746
01:53:38,060 --> 01:53:40,060
Like a twinkle. You have like a twinkle.

2747
01:53:40,140 --> 01:53:41,600
Are you trying to kiss me, bro?

2748
01:53:41,690 --> 01:53:43,270
Jesus fucking Christ.

2749
01:53:43,350 --> 01:53:45,310
- What's with you? - I have a... I don't know.

2750
01:53:45,400 --> 01:53:47,110
- It's not a homophobic thing. - All right...

2751
01:53:47,190 --> 01:53:48,900
You're just not the one for me, pal.

2752
01:53:48,980 --> 01:53:50,110
You know what I mean? It's not...

2753
01:53:50,190 --> 01:53:52,110
- It's not about that for me, you know. - I've heard enough.

2754
01:53:52,200 --> 01:53:54,610
Please, I'm begging, give me the fucking case.

2755
01:53:54,700 --> 01:53:56,070
- I'm gonna give you the case. - Give me the case.

2756
01:53:56,160 --> 01:53:57,530
- You gotta do me one favor. - What's that?

2757
01:53:57,620 --> 01:54:00,910
You gotta take this case, you gotta drive straight home,

2758
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:02,670
need you to open up the briefcase,

2759
01:54:02,670 --> 01:54:04,500
and you take out every single dollar.

2760
01:54:04,580 --> 01:54:06,540
Don't leave one dollar inside the briefcase.

2761
01:54:06,630 --> 01:54:07,750
And once you have it all

2762
01:54:07,840 --> 01:54:09,630
neatly organized outside the briefcase,

2763
01:54:09,710 --> 01:54:12,010
I need you to take it and I need you to shove it right up

2764
01:54:12,090 --> 01:54:14,180
your wife's Latvian cunt, you understand?

2765
01:54:14,260 --> 01:54:15,930
- My fucking wife! - Chill! Chill, bro.

2766
01:54:16,010 --> 01:54:17,470
Fuck. You motherfucking piece of shit!

2767
01:54:17,550 --> 01:54:18,600
How about now?

2768
01:54:18,760 --> 01:54:20,140
- Go, go! - Fuck!

2769
01:54:21,890 --> 01:54:23,600
Motherfuck! You're fucking dead!

2770
01:54:23,690 --> 01:54:25,350
Stop! Don't move! Don't move!

2771
01:54:25,440 --> 01:54:28,270
Stop, or I will blow you the fuck away!

2772
01:54:28,690 --> 01:54:30,860
Drop the case! Put your hands in the air!

2773
01:54:30,940 --> 01:54:32,070
Get down.

2774
01:54:32,860 --> 01:54:34,610
Get down on your knees! Get down on your knees!

2775
01:54:35,320 --> 01:54:39,830
Motherfucker!

2776
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:52,210
Jordan, do I have a surprise for you!

2777
01:54:52,460 --> 01:54:55,050
- What's that? - Twenty real Lemmons.

2778
01:54:55,130 --> 01:54:56,300
Retired pharmacist's client of mine,

2779
01:54:56,390 --> 01:54:57,550
they've been in the safe for 15 years.

2780
01:54:57,640 --> 01:54:59,100
Are you fucking kidding me? Lemmons?

2781
01:55:00,350 --> 01:55:02,220
They're gonna knock us on our fucking heads.

2782
01:55:02,310 --> 01:55:07,230
When it comes to Quaaludes, the Lemmon 714 was the Holy Grail.

2783
01:55:07,310 --> 01:55:08,810
- Can you believe it? - Oh, my God.

2784
01:55:08,900 --> 01:55:10,360
I thought they were like a myth.

2785
01:55:10,440 --> 01:55:12,320
Three times as powerful as anything available today.

2786
01:55:12,400 --> 01:55:13,440
Look at these babies.

2787
01:55:13,530 --> 01:55:16,110
Boy, Donnie really knew how to celebrate.

2788
01:55:16,200 --> 01:55:18,280
He said he was saving these for a special occasion.

2789
01:55:18,370 --> 01:55:20,950
Like a birthday, or being clap free,

2790
01:55:21,030 --> 01:55:24,000
or our money arriving safely in Switzerland.

2791
01:55:27,420 --> 01:55:28,670
So that night,

2792
01:55:28,750 --> 01:55:30,590
I cleared my schedule and I rid my body

2793
01:55:30,670 --> 01:55:33,170
of anything that could fuck with my high.

2794
01:55:33,880 --> 01:55:35,670
It was celebration time.

2795
01:55:36,260 --> 01:55:37,430
Okay.

2796
01:55:37,510 --> 01:55:39,010
Start off with one, see how it goes?

2797
01:55:39,090 --> 01:55:40,850
My guy says all we'll need is one.

2798
01:55:40,930 --> 01:55:42,350
Here you go.

2799
01:55:43,060 --> 01:55:44,720
- Salud! - Cheers.

2800
01:55:44,810 --> 01:55:47,600
Maybe if I pull it again, it'll go down.

2801
01:55:49,350 --> 01:55:50,610
Steve! Steve!

2802
01:55:50,690 --> 01:55:51,940
I gotta get out of here!

2803
01:55:52,020 --> 01:55:53,900
Carl, I think I got it figured out.

2804
01:55:53,980 --> 01:55:57,700
It must be one pull for up and two pulls for down.

2805
01:55:57,780 --> 01:55:59,030
Okay.

2806
01:56:07,370 --> 01:56:09,170
Do you feel anything?

2807
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:13,000
No.

2808
01:56:15,710 --> 01:56:17,550
It's been 35 minutes.

2809
01:56:20,050 --> 01:56:23,600
Maybe we've built up a tolerance after all these years, huh?

2810
01:56:36,740 --> 01:56:38,150
This is bullshit!

2811
01:56:38,240 --> 01:56:41,410
My metabolism's pumping. I can't feel shit!

2812
01:56:41,490 --> 01:56:42,660
They're old.

2813
01:56:42,740 --> 01:56:44,910
You think they lost their potency, huh?

2814
01:56:44,990 --> 01:56:46,620
Check the bottle!

2815
01:56:49,460 --> 01:56:50,870
January '81.

2816
01:56:50,960 --> 01:56:52,040
They're fucking duds.

2817
01:56:52,130 --> 01:56:53,170
Fuck!

2818
01:56:53,250 --> 01:56:54,340
Let's take...

2819
01:56:54,420 --> 01:56:55,920
Let's take two more each.

2820
01:56:57,880 --> 01:57:00,420
- Jordan. - Yeah, baby.

2821
01:57:04,100 --> 01:57:05,810
What are you two retards doing?

2822
01:57:05,890 --> 01:57:06,970
We're working out, honey.

2823
01:57:07,430 --> 01:57:09,020
Well, Bo Dietl's on the phone.

2824
01:57:09,100 --> 01:57:10,100
Okay.

2825
01:57:10,190 --> 01:57:12,100
- Okay? - Okay.

2826
01:57:13,610 --> 01:57:15,150
Hey, Bo, what's going on?

2827
01:57:15,230 --> 01:57:16,360
Jordan, listen to me clearly.

2828
01:57:16,440 --> 01:57:19,030
I cannot talk to you on this phone, I have to talk to you.

2829
01:57:19,110 --> 01:57:20,610
Get out of here. What's going on?

2830
01:57:20,700 --> 01:57:24,030
Listen to me! Leave the fucking house, Jordan,

2831
01:57:24,120 --> 01:57:25,780
and then call me from a pay phone.

2832
01:57:25,870 --> 01:57:27,830
This is not a fucking joke, Jordan.

2833
01:57:27,910 --> 01:57:29,540
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

2834
01:57:30,040 --> 01:57:31,370
- Shit. - What'd he say?

2835
01:57:31,460 --> 01:57:32,830
I don't know what the fuck's going on.

2836
01:57:32,920 --> 01:57:34,880
- I gotta go! - Is everything okay, Jordan?

2837
01:57:45,300 --> 01:57:47,050
The closest pay phone I could get to

2838
01:57:47,140 --> 01:57:49,430
was at the Brookville Country Club.

2839
01:57:50,100 --> 01:57:52,060
It was a real WASP stronghold,

2840
01:57:52,140 --> 01:57:54,730
just a mile down the road from my house.

2841
01:58:04,200 --> 01:58:05,610
Hey, Bo, what's up, it's me. What's going on?

2842
01:58:05,700 --> 01:58:06,740
I'm at a pay phone. What's going on?

2843
01:58:06,830 --> 01:58:07,950
Listen to me carefully.

2844
01:58:08,030 --> 01:58:09,780
Please. Your little friend there,

2845
01:58:09,780 --> 01:58:11,790
Brad, your little buddy, he's in jail.

2846
01:58:12,460 --> 01:58:13,750
What the fuck's he in jail for?

2847
01:58:13,830 --> 01:58:15,290
- What'd he do? - I don't know what he did.

2848
01:58:15,380 --> 01:58:16,710
My friends in Long Island told me

2849
01:58:16,790 --> 01:58:19,000
he got picked up in some fucking shopping mall.

2850
01:58:19,090 --> 01:58:20,090
He got locked up by...

2851
01:58:20,170 --> 01:58:22,420
Wait, wait. Did you... Did you say a shopping mall?

2852
01:58:22,510 --> 01:58:23,800
- Yeah. - He was with Donnie.

2853
01:58:23,880 --> 01:58:25,260
He was supposed to deliver some money,

2854
01:58:25,340 --> 01:58:26,890
- then that fucking fat piece of shit... - Listen to me!

2855
01:58:26,970 --> 01:58:27,970
I gotta go fucking talk to him right now!

2856
01:58:28,050 --> 01:58:29,970
Listen to me! Don't go! Listen to me.

2857
01:58:30,060 --> 01:58:32,680
That guy Denham, that FBI agent guy,

2858
01:58:32,770 --> 01:58:35,060
somebody told me he's got your phones tapped.

2859
01:58:35,150 --> 01:58:36,650
Your office and your home.

2860
01:58:36,730 --> 01:58:38,440
Don't talk on the motherfucking phone!

2861
01:58:38,520 --> 01:58:40,440
Okay. Fuck! I got it. I got it. I got it.

2862
01:58:40,900 --> 01:58:42,030
Jordan.

2863
01:58:42,570 --> 01:58:46,360
You didn't try to bribe this fucking FBI agent, did you?

2864
01:58:46,450 --> 01:58:48,490
No, I didn't try to bribe an FBI agent.

2865
01:58:48,580 --> 01:58:50,120
You think I'm that fucking stupid? No.

2866
01:58:50,200 --> 01:58:52,080
What the fuck did you say? I can't understand you.

2867
01:58:52,160 --> 01:58:53,330
Say that again.

2868
01:58:53,410 --> 01:58:56,210
I said...

2869
01:58:56,880 --> 01:58:58,790
What the fuck are you saying?

2870
01:58:59,380 --> 01:59:00,380
I said...

2871
01:59:00,460 --> 01:59:01,920
Are you fucking high?

2872
01:59:04,550 --> 01:59:07,180
Jordan, are you fucking high?

2873
01:59:08,010 --> 01:59:10,140
Jordan, do me a favor, stay where you are.

2874
01:59:10,220 --> 01:59:11,850
Don't get behind the wheel of the car.

2875
01:59:11,930 --> 01:59:13,470
I'm gonna send Rocco over to pick you up.

2876
01:59:13,560 --> 01:59:14,810
Jordan! Jordan!

2877
01:59:14,890 --> 01:59:17,140
After 15 years in storage,

2878
01:59:17,230 --> 01:59:20,190
the Lemmons had developed a delayed fuse.

2879
01:59:20,270 --> 01:59:22,940
It took 90 minutes for these little fuckers to kick in.

2880
01:59:23,030 --> 01:59:24,400
But once they did...

2881
01:59:25,950 --> 01:59:27,490
I mean, I had skipped the tingle phase

2882
01:59:27,570 --> 01:59:29,490
and went straight to the drool phase.

2883
01:59:29,570 --> 01:59:31,530
Tell me where you are! Don't fucking drive...

2884
01:59:31,620 --> 01:59:33,540
These little bastards were so strong,

2885
01:59:33,620 --> 01:59:35,660
I discovered a whole new phase.

2886
01:59:35,750 --> 01:59:37,790
The cerebral palsy phase.

2887
01:59:40,090 --> 01:59:42,090
Come on, stand up!

2888
01:59:46,050 --> 01:59:47,970
Okay, walking's out.

2889
01:59:48,930 --> 01:59:51,800
All right, think, think. What else is there?

2890
01:59:52,640 --> 01:59:56,350
Yes! I can crawl. I can crawl like Skylar!

2891
02:00:28,010 --> 02:00:30,970
Fuck! The kid makes it look so goddamn easy!

2892
02:00:38,020 --> 02:00:40,390
Think, you motherfucker, think!

2893
02:00:40,480 --> 02:00:41,810
Yes!

2894
02:00:41,900 --> 02:00:43,980
I got it! I've got it!

2895
02:00:44,400 --> 02:00:46,570
I can roll! I can roll!

2896
02:02:08,900 --> 02:02:13,070
Jordan.

2897
02:02:13,450 --> 02:02:15,110
Oh, Jesus. Where are you?

2898
02:02:15,200 --> 02:02:16,660
I'm at a country club!

2899
02:02:16,740 --> 02:02:17,780
What?

2900
02:02:17,870 --> 02:02:20,700
I'm at a country club!

2901
02:02:20,790 --> 02:02:22,120
I don't know what the fuck you're saying.

2902
02:02:22,210 --> 02:02:23,460
Look, you need to get home.

2903
02:02:23,540 --> 02:02:26,170
Donnie is out of control! He's on the other line

2904
02:02:26,250 --> 02:02:28,130
with some Swiss guy. I don't know...

2905
02:02:28,210 --> 02:02:29,210
What?

2906
02:02:29,300 --> 02:02:32,260
Get him off the phone!

2907
02:02:32,590 --> 02:02:35,340
I can't understand you!

2908
02:02:35,430 --> 02:02:36,680
Get him

2909
02:02:36,760 --> 02:02:37,800
off

2910
02:02:37,890 --> 02:02:39,010
the phone!

2911
02:02:39,100 --> 02:02:40,350
I don't know what the fuck you're saying, Jordan.

2912
02:02:40,430 --> 02:02:41,770
Can you just get home? Hurry!

2913
02:02:51,610 --> 02:02:53,740
I was less than a mile from home.

2914
02:02:53,820 --> 02:02:56,530
I drove as slow as I fucking could.

2915
02:02:56,610 --> 02:02:58,620
I'd seen Jell-O move faster.

2916
02:02:58,700 --> 02:03:01,120
I was gonna give you two million.

2917
02:03:01,290 --> 02:03:03,830
I's gonna be lates.

2918
02:03:04,500 --> 02:03:06,080
You ate two million?

2919
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:08,250
Later.

2920
02:03:08,330 --> 02:03:09,460
Get off the phone.

2921
02:03:09,540 --> 02:03:11,050
Get off the fucking phone! Idiot!

2922
02:03:12,420 --> 02:03:14,510
Get out of the way, asshole!

2923
02:03:17,180 --> 02:03:18,430
You hate two million?

2924
02:03:18,510 --> 02:03:20,010
No, you don't hate two million, Donnie.

2925
02:03:22,560 --> 02:03:25,430
By some miracle, I made it home alive,

2926
02:03:25,520 --> 02:03:27,810
not a scratch on me or the car.

2927
02:03:37,240 --> 02:03:38,320
Jordan?

2928
02:03:38,820 --> 02:03:41,410
Jesus fucking Christ!

2929
02:03:41,490 --> 02:03:42,990
What did you take?

2930
02:03:43,080 --> 02:03:44,370
What's wrong with you?

2931
02:03:44,450 --> 02:03:45,450
Jor!

2932
02:03:45,540 --> 02:03:47,920
It's fucking good, right?

2933
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:49,330
Fucked up!

2934
02:03:50,670 --> 02:03:52,500
Get off the phone!

2935
02:03:55,550 --> 02:03:57,760
What the fuck, Jordan?

2936
02:03:57,840 --> 02:03:59,430
Your daughter's in the house!

2937
02:03:59,510 --> 02:04:00,590
I hope you know that!

2938
02:04:00,680 --> 02:04:02,010
Your fucking daughter's in the house!

2939
02:04:02,510 --> 02:04:03,850
Yeah, it's real fucking funny, Donnie.

2940
02:04:04,060 --> 02:04:06,480
Get off the phone!

2941
02:04:07,640 --> 02:04:08,600
Jesus Christ, Jordan.

2942
02:04:08,690 --> 02:04:10,350
The FBI!

2943
02:04:11,690 --> 02:04:12,940
Hey!

2944
02:04:13,480 --> 02:04:15,360
I'm on phone!

2945
02:04:15,570 --> 02:04:17,950
Get off the fucking phone!

2946
02:04:19,700 --> 02:04:21,700
Come here! ...the phone.

2947
02:04:23,790 --> 02:04:26,910
Come on. We're gonna go upstairs, all right.

2948
02:04:31,790 --> 02:04:33,290
I'm on the phone!

2949
02:04:33,380 --> 02:04:34,710
On the phone!

2950
02:04:34,800 --> 02:04:36,880
I know what you did,

2951
02:04:37,380 --> 02:04:38,800
you piece of shit!

2952
02:04:38,880 --> 02:04:40,590
What? What?

2953
02:04:40,680 --> 02:04:46,890
Brad!

2954
02:04:46,980 --> 02:04:49,390
You fucking cocksucker!

2955
02:04:53,730 --> 02:04:55,610
What did you do,

2956
02:04:55,690 --> 02:04:57,480
you piece of shit?

2957
02:04:57,570 --> 02:04:58,990
Fuck you!

2958
02:05:00,240 --> 02:05:04,780
I wanna fucking kill you!

2959
02:05:05,740 --> 02:05:07,080
I got you!

2960
02:05:31,640 --> 02:05:33,560
What the fuck happened?

2961
02:05:34,020 --> 02:05:35,270
Oh, shit!

2962
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:37,230
Jordan? Jordan, are you all right?

2963
02:05:37,400 --> 02:05:38,980
Donnie? Donnie?

2964
02:05:39,320 --> 02:05:40,400
Donnie?

2965
02:05:40,490 --> 02:05:41,820
Jordan, he's not breathing.

2966
02:05:41,910 --> 02:05:43,700
Oh, fuck, I don't know what to do.

2967
02:05:43,780 --> 02:05:45,030
Jordan, I don't know what the fuck to do!

2968
02:05:45,120 --> 02:05:46,450
I can't help him! Oh, my God. Jordan.

2969
02:05:48,490 --> 02:05:51,040
Oh, my God, I think he's choking, Jordan. Do something.

2970
02:05:51,120 --> 02:05:52,870
- Oh, God. - Baby, I got you!

2971
02:05:53,460 --> 02:05:56,340
He's not breathing, Jordan. You gotta do something!

2972
02:05:57,250 --> 02:05:59,550
Shit! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

2973
02:06:01,470 --> 02:06:02,800
I got you.

2974
02:06:22,150 --> 02:06:23,740
Step aside!

2975
02:06:23,990 --> 02:06:27,280
Oh, God!

2976
02:06:27,660 --> 02:06:29,410
Move aside, baby.

2977
02:06:36,380 --> 02:06:38,170
Come on! Come on!

2978
02:06:38,250 --> 02:06:39,460
Come on!

2979
02:06:44,010 --> 02:06:46,680
Jordan, he's not breathing. You gotta do something.

2980
02:06:47,720 --> 02:06:49,760
Jordan, he's a father! He's got fucking kids!

2981
02:06:49,850 --> 02:06:51,520
- Do something! - Yeah?

2982
02:06:57,190 --> 02:06:58,270
Rocco, you gotta get over here.

2983
02:06:58,360 --> 02:07:00,270
- Come on. - Call an ambulance!

2984
02:07:00,360 --> 02:07:01,530
I don't fucking know!

2985
02:07:01,610 --> 02:07:03,360
Just get over here! Call 911.

2986
02:07:13,960 --> 02:07:16,290
You all right? He's all right.

2987
02:07:29,470 --> 02:07:33,970
Mr. Belfort?

2988
02:07:36,640 --> 02:07:39,560
Get the fuck out of here. Fuck.

2989
02:07:39,650 --> 02:07:42,150
Sir, we need to ask you some questions.

2990
02:07:42,820 --> 02:07:44,780
Are you fucking kidding me? Fuck you.

2991
02:07:44,860 --> 02:07:45,990
Come on, get up.

2992
02:07:46,070 --> 02:07:47,610
Get the fuck out of my house.

2993
02:07:49,410 --> 02:07:51,120
- Let's go. - I've been here all night.

2994
02:07:51,200 --> 02:07:52,700
I been sitting here all night.

2995
02:07:52,790 --> 02:07:54,160
What the fuck are you talking about?

2996
02:07:54,250 --> 02:07:56,200
- Where you taking him? - Where you taking me?

2997
02:07:56,290 --> 02:07:57,370
Where you taking him?

2998
02:07:57,460 --> 02:07:58,500
You ain't got no warrant.

2999
02:07:58,580 --> 02:07:59,880
Just come up in people's house like that!

3000
02:08:01,040 --> 02:08:03,340
Did you drive your car tonight, Mr. Belfort?

3001
02:08:04,920 --> 02:08:05,960
Well?

3002
02:08:10,930 --> 02:08:12,720
Maybe I hadn't made it home okay.

3003
02:08:27,860 --> 02:08:30,240
Get out of the fucking way!

3004
02:08:32,200 --> 02:08:33,450
Fuck!

3005
02:08:39,080 --> 02:08:42,710
Did you drive that car tonight?

3006
02:08:43,840 --> 02:08:45,960
- Yeah. - Yeah, right.

3007
02:08:46,050 --> 02:08:47,840
I'm a family man!

3008
02:08:47,920 --> 02:08:49,670
Family man. Honey!

3009
02:08:49,760 --> 02:08:51,720
It was a miracle I wasn't killed,

3010
02:08:51,800 --> 02:08:54,810
or that I didn't kill anybody else.

3011
02:08:54,890 --> 02:08:58,060
The cops took me in for questioning, but they couldn't charge me.

3012
02:08:58,140 --> 02:09:00,560
They had no proof I was even behind the wheel.

3013
02:09:00,650 --> 02:09:01,730
Meanwhile,

3014
02:09:01,810 --> 02:09:03,900
Brad did three months in jail for contempt,

3015
02:09:03,980 --> 02:09:06,570
because he wouldn't rat Donnie out.

3016
02:09:06,650 --> 02:09:09,360
The result, I was scot-free.

3017
02:09:09,450 --> 02:09:11,820
But I had eyes on me like never before.

3018
02:09:11,910 --> 02:09:13,570
You're a lucky man, Jordan.

3019
02:09:13,660 --> 02:09:16,580
You're lucky to be alive, let alone not in jail.

3020
02:09:16,660 --> 02:09:18,250
You know I don't believe in luck, right?

3021
02:09:18,330 --> 02:09:19,660
But it's time.

3022
02:09:19,750 --> 02:09:22,000
Please, let me call the SEC and cut a deal

3023
02:09:22,080 --> 02:09:24,000
before your luck runs out.

3024
02:09:24,090 --> 02:09:25,670
Wave to Daddy.

3025
02:09:25,750 --> 02:09:26,840
Hey.

3026
02:09:26,920 --> 02:09:28,420
Hey, sweetie.

3027
02:09:33,640 --> 02:09:36,930
What kind of terms would you be talking about if I...

3028
02:09:37,010 --> 02:09:38,220
I don't know.

3029
02:09:38,310 --> 02:09:41,270
You plead guilty to a handful of securities violations,

3030
02:09:41,350 --> 02:09:44,400
stock manipulation, high-pressure sales tactics.

3031
02:09:44,480 --> 02:09:47,270
Ticky-tack shit like that, you know.

3032
02:09:47,360 --> 02:09:49,320
You pay a couple million dollars in fines,

3033
02:09:49,400 --> 02:09:52,360
in exchange, the SEC fucks off till the end of time.

3034
02:09:54,700 --> 02:09:56,320
And Stratton?

3035
02:09:56,830 --> 02:09:58,700
What happens to Stratton?

3036
02:09:58,790 --> 02:10:01,620
There's no way... I mean... You got to walk away. Right?

3037
02:10:01,710 --> 02:10:02,830
Let Donnie be in charge.

3038
02:10:02,920 --> 02:10:04,540
Right. Donnie.

3039
02:10:05,250 --> 02:10:07,420
Now the FBI is another animal completely.

3040
02:10:07,500 --> 02:10:09,300
They'll still be pursuing you for criminal wrongdoing.

3041
02:10:09,380 --> 02:10:12,130
However, with you stepping down voluntarily,

3042
02:10:12,220 --> 02:10:14,130
my guess is that your best friend Agent Denham

3043
02:10:14,220 --> 02:10:16,550
will be standing around with his dick in his hand.

3044
02:10:17,680 --> 02:10:18,970
Jordan.

3045
02:10:19,060 --> 02:10:20,970
What do you have to think about?

3046
02:10:21,060 --> 02:10:22,640
You beat them.

3047
02:10:22,730 --> 02:10:23,850
You won!

3048
02:10:23,940 --> 02:10:25,560
God knows you never have to work again.

3049
02:10:25,650 --> 02:10:27,650
What're you gonna do? Spend the rest of your life in jail?

3050
02:10:27,730 --> 02:10:28,820
- Is that what you want? - No.

3051
02:10:28,900 --> 02:10:29,940
- Of course not. - Okay.

3052
02:10:30,030 --> 02:10:32,070
Okay! You got all the money in the world.

3053
02:10:32,150 --> 02:10:33,740
You need everybody else's money?

3054
02:10:33,820 --> 02:10:35,240
- Of course not, Pops. - Well?

3055
02:10:35,320 --> 02:10:37,660
- You know, I built it. - I know you built it.

3056
02:10:37,740 --> 02:10:39,450
You built it, so now preserve it.

3057
02:11:10,690 --> 02:11:12,110
You know,

3058
02:11:12,490 --> 02:11:15,200
five years ago, when I started Stratton Oakmont

3059
02:11:15,280 --> 02:11:17,360
with Donnie Azoff, I knew the day

3060
02:11:17,450 --> 02:11:20,740
would eventually come where I'd have to be moving on.

3061
02:11:22,700 --> 02:11:26,500
And it's truly with a heavy heart that I'm here to say that...

3062
02:11:28,130 --> 02:11:30,290
That that day is finally here.

3063
02:11:34,510 --> 02:11:36,800
I wanna... I want to thank you all for your...

3064
02:11:36,880 --> 02:11:39,550
Your years of loyalty and admiration.

3065
02:11:39,640 --> 02:11:41,100
But the point is this.

3066
02:11:42,060 --> 02:11:43,310
Under Donnie's leadership,

3067
02:11:43,390 --> 02:11:46,850
along with Nicky Koskoff and Robbie Feinberg

3068
02:11:46,940 --> 02:11:48,530
moving into key management positions,

3069
02:11:48,530 --> 02:11:51,150
this place really, is gonna be better than ever!

3070
02:11:51,230 --> 02:11:53,360
That I promise you. Okay?

3071
02:11:53,730 --> 02:11:56,240
Give them a round of applause. Come on.

3072
02:11:59,320 --> 02:12:02,080
This is Ellis Island here, people.

3073
02:12:02,160 --> 02:12:03,830
I don't care who you are, where you're from,

3074
02:12:03,910 --> 02:12:06,410
whether your relatives came over on the fucking Mayflower

3075
02:12:06,500 --> 02:12:08,670
or on an inner tube from Haiti,

3076
02:12:08,750 --> 02:12:11,000
this right here is the land of opportunity.

3077
02:12:11,090 --> 02:12:13,590
Stratton Oakmont is America!

3078
02:12:17,630 --> 02:12:19,260
All of you know Kimmie Belzer, right?

3079
02:12:19,340 --> 02:12:20,550
Yes, we do.

3080
02:12:20,640 --> 02:12:21,760
Fuck you.

3081
02:12:22,430 --> 02:12:23,640
Come on, Kimmie.

3082
02:12:23,720 --> 02:12:25,270
What you probably didn't know is,

3083
02:12:25,350 --> 02:12:27,140
Kimmie was one of the first brokers here,

3084
02:12:27,230 --> 02:12:29,520
one of Stratton's original 20.

3085
02:12:30,270 --> 02:12:32,110
Now most of you met Kimmie,

3086
02:12:32,190 --> 02:12:35,190
the beautiful sophisticated woman that she is today.

3087
02:12:35,610 --> 02:12:38,700
A woman that wears $3,000 Armani suits.

3088
02:12:40,700 --> 02:12:43,240
Who drives a brand-new Mercedes-Benz.

3089
02:12:43,950 --> 02:12:47,290
A woman who spends her winters in the Bahamas,

3090
02:12:47,370 --> 02:12:49,500
and summers in the Hamptons!

3091
02:12:54,500 --> 02:12:56,840
That's not the Kimmie that I met.

3092
02:12:59,680 --> 02:13:03,430
The Kimmie that I met didn't have two nickels to rub together.

3093
02:13:04,680 --> 02:13:06,930
She was a single mom on the balls of her ass

3094
02:13:07,020 --> 02:13:08,810
with an eight-year-old son.

3095
02:13:08,890 --> 02:13:11,900
Okay? She was three months behind on her rent.

3096
02:13:12,980 --> 02:13:16,650
And when she came to me and asked me for a job,

3097
02:13:16,730 --> 02:13:18,940
she asked for a $5,000 advance,

3098
02:13:19,030 --> 02:13:22,200
just so she could pay her son's tuition.

3099
02:13:26,660 --> 02:13:28,370
And what'd I do, Kimmie?

3100
02:13:28,450 --> 02:13:30,160
Go on, tell them.

3101
02:13:31,920 --> 02:13:33,960
You wrote me a check

3102
02:13:34,210 --> 02:13:36,290
for $25,000.

3103
02:13:37,590 --> 02:13:39,050
That's right.

3104
02:13:39,170 --> 02:13:40,510
Thank you.

3105
02:13:43,930 --> 02:13:45,680
And you know why that is?

3106
02:13:49,020 --> 02:13:51,310
It's because I believed in you.

3107
02:13:53,020 --> 02:13:55,730
It's because I believed in you, Kimmie,

3108
02:13:56,150 --> 02:14:00,030
just like I believe in each and every one of you here today.

3109
02:14:00,110 --> 02:14:02,530
- I fucking love you, Jordan! - I fucking love you.

3110
02:14:02,610 --> 02:14:04,410
I fucking love you! I love you.

3111
02:14:04,490 --> 02:14:07,280
I fucking love you, too! I fucking love you, too!

3112
02:14:10,200 --> 02:14:12,210
And I love all of you!

3113
02:14:12,790 --> 02:14:15,130
And I love all of you from the bottom of my heart.

3114
02:14:15,210 --> 02:14:17,670
- I fucking love you, too. - I mean that.

3115
02:14:18,500 --> 02:14:20,800
You are the shit. You are the fucking shit.

3116
02:14:27,300 --> 02:14:29,470
It's a shame, you know.

3117
02:14:31,060 --> 02:14:32,600
For years, I've been telling

3118
02:14:32,600 --> 02:14:35,190
you guys never to take no for an answer, right?

3119
02:14:35,270 --> 02:14:38,480
You know, to keep pushing, to never hang up the phone

3120
02:14:39,400 --> 02:14:41,650
until you get what you want.

3121
02:14:42,530 --> 02:14:44,280
Because you all deserve it.

3122
02:14:46,320 --> 02:14:49,490
You know, this fucking deal that I'm about to sign,

3123
02:14:49,990 --> 02:14:52,120
barring me from the securities industry,

3124
02:14:52,200 --> 02:14:54,250
barring me from Stratton,

3125
02:14:55,330 --> 02:14:56,750
my home.

3126
02:14:59,500 --> 02:15:01,500
What the fuck is that, you know?

3127
02:15:02,720 --> 02:15:05,050
I'll tell you what it is. It's...

3128
02:15:05,800 --> 02:15:08,600
It's me taking no for an answer, you know.

3129
02:15:10,100 --> 02:15:11,350
It's them...

3130
02:15:11,430 --> 02:15:14,680
It's them selling me, not the other way around.

3131
02:15:15,440 --> 02:15:18,150
It's me being a hypocrite is what it is.

3132
02:15:23,320 --> 02:15:24,570
So...

3133
02:15:31,700 --> 02:15:33,240
You know what?

3134
02:15:37,040 --> 02:15:42,250
I'm not leaving.

3135
02:15:45,220 --> 02:15:46,380
I'm not fucking leaving!

3136
02:15:51,430 --> 02:15:53,850
You're not getting a fucking promotion!

3137
02:15:55,230 --> 02:15:56,560
The show goes on!

3138
02:15:59,190 --> 02:16:00,610
This is my home!

3139
02:16:00,690 --> 02:16:03,440
They're gonna need a fucking wrecking ball

3140
02:16:03,530 --> 02:16:05,400
to take me out of here!

3141
02:16:07,400 --> 02:16:09,910
They're gonna need to send in the National Guard

3142
02:16:09,990 --> 02:16:11,740
or fucking SWAT team,

3143
02:16:11,830 --> 02:16:14,330
'cause I ain't going nowhere!

3144
02:16:17,160 --> 02:16:22,420
Fuck them!

3145
02:16:56,540 --> 02:16:58,330
Jordy! Jordy!

3146
02:16:58,460 --> 02:17:00,460
Jordy! Get back here!

3147
02:17:01,290 --> 02:17:02,460
Hey!

3148
02:17:04,920 --> 02:17:06,170
Give me that.

3149
02:17:08,670 --> 02:17:09,800
What is this?

3150
02:17:09,880 --> 02:17:12,390
Ramar of the Jungle, for Christ sake?

3151
02:17:13,470 --> 02:17:16,390
Paddy D, mazel tov, you Irishman.

3152
02:17:16,470 --> 02:17:19,930
Jordan Belfort just welched on his deal with the SEC.

3153
02:17:20,020 --> 02:17:22,690
He is back in the ocean. Happy hunting.

3154
02:17:35,620 --> 02:17:37,910
It was our time to party big.

3155
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,620
And just as Brad was released from jail, too.

3156
02:17:41,460 --> 02:17:45,420
I apologized, even offered to pay him for his time in the can.

3157
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,090
But he said no, that he was out.

3158
02:17:48,170 --> 02:17:50,050
He didn't want any part of us.

3159
02:17:50,130 --> 02:17:51,760
Sad thing was,

3160
02:17:51,840 --> 02:17:55,050
two years later he was dead.

3161
02:17:55,220 --> 02:17:57,640
Massive heart attack. Thirty-five.

3162
02:17:58,430 --> 02:18:00,770
Same age Mozart died.

3163
02:18:00,850 --> 02:18:04,100
Not that they have a hell of a lot in common, but...

3164
02:18:04,190 --> 02:18:06,520
Anyway, I don't know why that came to mind.

3165
02:18:08,690 --> 02:18:12,280
Within days, subpoenas started flying.

3166
02:18:12,360 --> 02:18:15,700
Notices to produce documents, depositions, you name it.

3167
02:18:15,780 --> 02:18:17,780
Donnie couldn't drink water fast enough.

3168
02:18:17,870 --> 02:18:20,330
United States government wants to give me a subpoena?

3169
02:18:20,410 --> 02:18:23,710
Here's what we do with subpoenas at Stratton Oakmont!

3170
02:18:29,460 --> 02:18:32,090
Fuck you, USA! Fuck you!

3171
02:18:32,170 --> 02:18:34,050
Fuck you! Fuck you!

3172
02:18:34,130 --> 02:18:35,930
Fuck you!

3173
02:18:43,690 --> 02:18:45,730
Jordan Belfort.

3174
02:18:45,810 --> 02:18:47,690
Alden. That's a nice name.

3175
02:18:47,770 --> 02:18:49,070
Thank you very much for that.

3176
02:18:49,150 --> 02:18:51,320
- What kind of name is that? - That is my name.

3177
02:18:51,400 --> 02:18:53,070
I do not recall that.

3178
02:18:53,150 --> 02:18:55,490
I do not recall that. Okay?

3179
02:18:55,570 --> 02:18:57,740
Mr. Ming, thank you for coming in today.

3180
02:18:57,830 --> 02:18:59,450
Are you gonna finish the rest of that Danish?

3181
02:18:59,540 --> 02:19:00,740
- Can I have that Danish? - No, no, go ahead.

3182
02:19:00,830 --> 02:19:02,500
They interrogated everybody.

3183
02:19:02,580 --> 02:19:04,210
I got a low blood sugar, thyroid thing.

3184
02:19:04,290 --> 02:19:05,460
It went on for months.

3185
02:19:05,540 --> 02:19:07,580
It was a total fucking harassment.

3186
02:19:07,670 --> 02:19:09,210
Tell him to proceed with the questions.

3187
02:19:09,290 --> 02:19:11,750
But not a single Strattonite cracked.

3188
02:19:11,840 --> 02:19:13,510
Gladys Carrera?

3189
02:19:13,590 --> 02:19:15,130
Doesn't ring a bell.

3190
02:19:15,220 --> 02:19:17,840
Sorry, I have no recommendation of that.

3191
02:19:18,010 --> 02:19:19,010
No.

3192
02:19:19,100 --> 02:19:20,100
No idea.

3193
02:19:20,180 --> 02:19:22,680
I don't recall that transaction. You guys have any milk?

3194
02:19:22,770 --> 02:19:25,020
Absolutely not.

3195
02:19:25,100 --> 02:19:26,940
Francis Sortigi you called so many times,

3196
02:19:27,020 --> 02:19:29,230
I just thought you might remember that.

3197
02:19:29,310 --> 02:19:30,820
Would you remember any of those?

3198
02:19:30,900 --> 02:19:32,650
- I do not recall any of that. - This Abdul...

3199
02:19:32,740 --> 02:19:34,900
I do not... No, I don't recall.

3200
02:19:34,990 --> 02:19:36,650
It was a long phone call.

3201
02:19:36,740 --> 02:19:38,410
I just wondered if you have any memory of that.

3202
02:19:38,490 --> 02:19:39,770
Okay. You know we've talked

3203
02:19:39,770 --> 02:19:41,660
to several of the employees at this firm,

3204
02:19:41,740 --> 02:19:45,040
and nobody can recall anything about this Steve Madden IPO.

3205
02:19:45,120 --> 02:19:46,370
I think it's odd.

3206
02:19:48,250 --> 02:19:50,750
Do you recall Cartage Corporation?

3207
02:19:52,250 --> 02:19:53,500
You do recall it?

3208
02:19:53,590 --> 02:19:54,880
No, I don't recall that at all.

3209
02:19:55,470 --> 02:19:58,380
Excuse me. I have to ask. Is that your real hair?

3210
02:19:59,010 --> 02:20:01,140
Are you gonna say anything about that?

3211
02:20:01,220 --> 02:20:02,510
Are you gonna comment on my hair?

3212
02:20:02,600 --> 02:20:04,310
Is that how we're doing... Is this personal questions?

3213
02:20:04,390 --> 02:20:06,060
I'm just wondering why you would wear something like that.

3214
02:20:06,140 --> 02:20:07,980
Sorry. I don't recall that company.

3215
02:20:10,060 --> 02:20:11,810
Can I get you anything else, gentlemen?

3216
02:20:11,900 --> 02:20:13,730
Yes. Sweetheart, I have a rare condition

3217
02:20:13,820 --> 02:20:17,240
which requires me to drink one of those every 15 minutes, please.

3218
02:20:17,700 --> 02:20:20,820
We were specifically advised not to leave the country.

3219
02:20:20,910 --> 02:20:22,950
So, we took our wives to Italy.

3220
02:20:23,330 --> 02:20:25,750
We figured we were safer working from overseas

3221
02:20:25,830 --> 02:20:27,210
giving orders to Rugrat.

3222
02:20:27,290 --> 02:20:29,460
Nobody could arrest us and nobody could prove

3223
02:20:29,540 --> 02:20:31,540
I was still running Stratton from a yacht.

3224
02:20:31,630 --> 02:20:32,880
Hey, Rugrat.

3225
02:20:32,960 --> 02:20:34,130
Bonjour.

3226
02:20:34,210 --> 02:20:36,210
You bald-headed eagle, how you doing?

3227
02:20:36,300 --> 02:20:37,260
Donnie, Donnie, listen!

3228
02:20:37,340 --> 02:20:38,630
We have a problem, okay.

3229
02:20:38,720 --> 02:20:41,970
Your friend, Steve Madden, is unloading shares.

3230
02:20:42,050 --> 02:20:44,100
What are you saying? Who told you that?

3231
02:20:44,180 --> 02:20:45,770
- What's going on? - He's doing it, Donnie!

3232
02:20:45,850 --> 02:20:48,310
He said that Steve Madden's unloading shares.

3233
02:20:48,390 --> 02:20:49,520
Who told you that? It's bullshit!

3234
02:20:49,600 --> 02:20:51,940
Give me that goddamn phone.

3235
02:20:52,020 --> 02:20:53,560
- What's going on? - Don't listen...

3236
02:20:53,770 --> 02:20:55,860
Jordan, look. I'm watching the screen

3237
02:20:55,940 --> 02:20:58,650
and huge chunks of Steve Madden are being sold, okay.

3238
02:20:58,740 --> 02:21:00,780
It's not coming from us, so it's gotta be Steve.

3239
02:21:00,860 --> 02:21:02,910
He's the only person with that many shares.

3240
02:21:02,990 --> 02:21:03,950
It's Donnie. Call me back, all right.

3241
02:21:04,030 --> 02:21:06,370
Donnie, your little friend is trying to fuck me, you know that.

3242
02:21:06,500 --> 02:21:08,200
Your little friend is trying to fuck me right in the ass.

3243
02:21:08,290 --> 02:21:09,870
- Get him on the phone now! - We don't know anything yet.

3244
02:21:09,960 --> 02:21:11,330
Let's not jump to conclusions.

3245
02:21:11,830 --> 02:21:13,540
Even though I owned 85%

3246
02:21:13,630 --> 02:21:16,670
of Steve-cocksucking- motherfucking-Madden Shoes,

3247
02:21:16,760 --> 02:21:19,010
the shares were in his fucking name.

3248
02:21:19,090 --> 02:21:21,300
This motherfucker knew I was in trouble with the feds

3249
02:21:21,390 --> 02:21:23,180
and was trying to take advantage.

3250
02:21:23,260 --> 02:21:24,760
Talk to me, man. How do you wanna play this?

3251
02:21:24,850 --> 02:21:26,600
I want you to get all our clients on the phone right now,

3252
02:21:26,680 --> 02:21:27,970
and have them start selling Steve Madden.

3253
02:21:28,060 --> 02:21:29,520
We're gonna drive that fucking price down!

3254
02:21:29,600 --> 02:21:31,100
Do you hear me? Shut the fuck up!

3255
02:21:31,230 --> 02:21:32,850
This is your fucking friend from high school.

3256
02:21:33,020 --> 02:21:35,110
If that little fucking prick thinks he can fuck with me,

3257
02:21:35,190 --> 02:21:37,780
we'll turn his company into a penny stock! You hear me?

3258
02:21:37,860 --> 02:21:39,280
- You got it? - Yes. I got it!

3259
02:21:39,360 --> 02:21:40,350
Let's just not jump to

3260
02:21:40,350 --> 02:21:42,280
conclusions before we know what's going on.

3261
02:21:42,360 --> 02:21:44,910
Captain Ted!

3262
02:21:45,410 --> 02:21:47,790
Hang up your phones! Everybody, hey!

3263
02:21:47,870 --> 02:21:50,620
Turn the boat around! We're going home!

3264
02:21:53,750 --> 02:21:56,130
Baby! Baby, what happened?

3265
02:21:56,420 --> 02:21:57,670
I just...

3266
02:21:58,090 --> 02:21:59,340
Sweetheart, what's going on?

3267
02:22:00,470 --> 02:22:02,090
Aunt Emma...

3268
02:22:02,970 --> 02:22:04,260
Just wait.

3269
02:22:04,680 --> 02:22:06,300
I can't...

3270
02:22:06,390 --> 02:22:09,270
What's going on? Why you crying?

3271
02:22:09,350 --> 02:22:11,390
- She's dead! - Who? Who's dead?

3272
02:22:11,480 --> 02:22:13,850
I just got a call from my cousin Betty.

3273
02:22:13,940 --> 02:22:15,020
Yeah?

3274
02:22:15,110 --> 02:22:16,810
Aunt Emma is dead.

3275
02:22:18,230 --> 02:22:20,940
- Are you fucking kidding me? - No.

3276
02:22:21,280 --> 02:22:22,450
You're serious?

3277
02:22:23,240 --> 02:22:25,530
Oh, my God! Baby, that's...

3278
02:22:25,620 --> 02:22:27,070
Oh, fuck!

3279
02:22:27,160 --> 02:22:28,950
Oh, sweetheart, that's just...

3280
02:22:29,040 --> 02:22:30,370
Fucking heart attack!

3281
02:22:30,450 --> 02:22:32,040
Boom, snap, gone.

3282
02:22:32,120 --> 02:22:33,960
Shuffled off her mortal coil.

3283
02:22:34,040 --> 02:22:37,380
And $20 million stuck in a Swiss bank account.

3284
02:22:37,460 --> 02:22:39,550
The last time I talked to her she was fine!

3285
02:22:39,630 --> 02:22:41,800
- She's not that old. - Oh, God! Baby, oh, God!

3286
02:22:41,880 --> 02:22:44,050
That's so fucking terrible!

3287
02:22:44,130 --> 02:22:45,840
Oh, fuck!

3288
02:22:45,930 --> 02:22:46,930
It is terrible.

3289
02:22:47,010 --> 02:22:49,560
Your aunt was such an elegant, attractive woman.

3290
02:22:49,640 --> 02:22:51,560
My condolences to you and your family.

3291
02:22:51,640 --> 02:22:52,980
Yes. We're absolutely devastated.

3292
02:22:53,060 --> 02:22:55,060
Thank you so much for your condolences.

3293
02:22:55,150 --> 02:22:58,060
Now where does that leave us in regard to her account exactly?

3294
02:22:58,150 --> 02:22:59,650
Does it go into probate or what?

3295
02:22:59,730 --> 02:23:01,320
Not to worry, Jordan. Not to worry.

3296
02:23:01,400 --> 02:23:03,070
Your aunt, before she died,

3297
02:23:03,150 --> 02:23:06,070
signed a document naming you as her successor.

3298
02:23:06,320 --> 02:23:07,820
She did?

3299
02:23:07,910 --> 02:23:09,530
Fantastic! Well, that's good news!

3300
02:23:09,830 --> 02:23:11,990
Well, not as of yet.

3301
02:23:12,330 --> 02:23:14,330
What does that mean? Not as of yet?

3302
02:23:16,750 --> 02:23:18,460
I can't seem to hear you.

3303
02:23:18,540 --> 02:23:21,250
I must have bad reception. Are you speaking English?

3304
02:23:21,420 --> 02:23:24,090
- Very... Now. Fast. Very fast. - Fast?

3305
02:23:24,170 --> 02:23:26,300
I have to get to Switzerland now?

3306
02:23:28,010 --> 02:23:30,100
Speak English! Fucking speak English!

3307
02:23:30,180 --> 02:23:31,470
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey. Hey! Quiet, okay?

3308
02:23:31,560 --> 02:23:34,380
Take your suit, take your dick, okay, and move your ass! Please.

3309
02:23:35,540 --> 02:23:36,890
Okay. Move my ass! Yes!

3310
02:23:36,980 --> 02:23:41,110
I gotta say, these Swiss were some sneaky motherfuckers.

3311
02:23:41,190 --> 02:23:43,110
Within minutes, he had me set up with a forger

3312
02:23:43,190 --> 02:23:45,190
who could fake Aunt Emma's signature.

3313
02:23:45,280 --> 02:23:46,820
You American shit!

3314
02:23:46,990 --> 02:23:50,370
I just had to get there by tomorrow, or lose $20 million.

3315
02:23:50,450 --> 02:23:52,160
We're going to Monaco!

3316
02:23:52,700 --> 02:23:55,000
- Monaco? Now? - Yes, baby.

3317
02:23:55,080 --> 02:23:57,670
We're going to Monaco, so then we can go to Switzerland, okay?

3318
02:23:57,750 --> 02:23:59,460
- But her aunt just died. - I realize that.

3319
02:23:59,540 --> 02:24:00,940
But I have business in Switzerland.

3320
02:24:00,940 --> 02:24:02,460
I need to go to Switzerland right now.

3321
02:24:02,550 --> 02:24:04,630
Bottom line. Sorry.

3322
02:24:04,920 --> 02:24:06,720
We gotta get to London.

3323
02:24:07,220 --> 02:24:08,470
Why? Why?

3324
02:24:09,970 --> 02:24:11,140
The funeral!

3325
02:24:11,220 --> 02:24:12,560
Yeah, but, babe. Look, look...

3326
02:24:13,060 --> 02:24:15,810
I loved your aunt more than anyone in the entire world.

3327
02:24:15,890 --> 02:24:17,390
I really did.

3328
02:24:17,890 --> 02:24:20,150
But she's dead now, sweetie.

3329
02:24:20,230 --> 02:24:22,440
She's dead and she's not going anywhere.

3330
02:24:22,520 --> 02:24:24,900
She'll still be dead by the time we get to London, okay?

3331
02:24:25,570 --> 02:24:27,320
Captain Ted! Captain Ted, all right, look.

3332
02:24:27,400 --> 02:24:29,200
We're going to Monaco. Monaco now, okay?

3333
02:24:29,280 --> 02:24:30,320
Monaco, right.

3334
02:24:30,410 --> 02:24:32,280
We're going to Monaco so that we can drive to Switzerland

3335
02:24:32,370 --> 02:24:33,660
so they don't stamp our passports.

3336
02:24:33,740 --> 02:24:35,620
Take care of business here, we'll drive back to Monaco,

3337
02:24:35,700 --> 02:24:37,370
take a flight over to London to catch the funeral

3338
02:24:37,460 --> 02:24:38,960
and be in New York in three fucking business days!

3339
02:24:39,040 --> 02:24:40,210
That's the fucking plan.

3340
02:24:40,290 --> 02:24:42,670
I just want you to know that we might run into some chop.

3341
02:24:42,750 --> 02:24:44,960
Chop? We can fucking handle chop, right?

3342
02:24:45,050 --> 02:24:46,460
I mean, it's a 170-foot yacht.

3343
02:24:46,550 --> 02:24:47,580
No, no, no. We're not going

3344
02:24:47,580 --> 02:24:49,300
anywhere unless he says it's safe, all right.

3345
02:24:49,380 --> 02:24:50,800
- Don't worry about the chop. - It's safe.

3346
02:24:50,890 --> 02:24:52,220
You don't know shit about chop.

3347
02:24:52,300 --> 02:24:54,510
Oh, really? And you do? You're a fucking expert on that.

3348
02:24:54,600 --> 02:24:56,930
I'll chop your fucking credit card in half. How about that?

3349
02:24:57,020 --> 02:24:58,890
Chop is fine. Trust me. Chop is fine.

3350
02:24:58,980 --> 02:25:00,690
Is chop fine, Captain Ted?

3351
02:25:02,020 --> 02:25:03,860
Yeah. I mean, if we take it slow.

3352
02:25:03,940 --> 02:25:05,110
Yeah, we're gonna take it slow.

3353
02:25:05,190 --> 02:25:06,780
It's a little uncomfortable. Tell them it's safe.

3354
02:25:06,860 --> 02:25:08,030
It's gonna be safe.

3355
02:25:08,110 --> 02:25:11,700
We'll batten down the hatches and secure the deck.

3356
02:25:11,780 --> 02:25:15,490
And we're looking at a few... maybe a few broken dishes.

3357
02:25:15,580 --> 02:25:16,700
Few broken dishes.

3358
02:25:16,790 --> 02:25:18,000
What's a few broken dishes?

3359
02:25:18,080 --> 02:25:19,370
Does that sound fucking awesome or what?

3360
02:25:19,460 --> 02:25:20,830
No. Not really.

3361
02:25:20,920 --> 02:25:22,210
We're gonna have a fucking good time!

3362
02:25:22,290 --> 02:25:24,040
Let's go to fucking Monaco now!

3363
02:25:24,130 --> 02:25:25,290
Let's fucking move! Let's go!

3364
02:25:30,720 --> 02:25:31,760
Hold on!

3365
02:25:34,930 --> 02:25:37,930
What the fuck is going on out here?

3366
02:25:38,020 --> 02:25:40,640
The Jet Skis just went overboard!

3367
02:25:40,730 --> 02:25:42,730
Oh, Jesus Christ! Honey, you okay?

3368
02:25:42,810 --> 02:25:44,940
Gale warning! Gale warning!

3369
02:25:45,020 --> 02:25:47,820
The waves are 20 feet high and building!

3370
02:25:47,900 --> 02:25:49,570
Turn around, let's go the other fucking way.

3371
02:25:49,650 --> 02:25:50,860
- We can't! - Go!

3372
02:25:50,950 --> 02:25:53,530
We'll get broad-sided. It'll tip over!

3373
02:25:53,620 --> 02:25:55,410
I am a master diver. You hear that?

3374
02:25:55,490 --> 02:25:56,530
I'm a master diver!

3375
02:25:56,620 --> 02:25:57,870
No one's gonna fucking die!

3376
02:25:57,950 --> 02:26:00,580
I got you, baby. I got you. Trust me, okay?

3377
02:26:00,660 --> 02:26:01,910
I love you.

3378
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:03,920
I love you, baby. Just hold on tight.

3379
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:05,040
Okay.

3380
02:26:05,130 --> 02:26:06,170
Donnie!

3381
02:26:07,750 --> 02:26:08,960
Hold on, baby!

3382
02:26:09,050 --> 02:26:13,130
Donnie!

3383
02:26:13,640 --> 02:26:15,010
- What? - Hold on, baby.

3384
02:26:15,100 --> 02:26:16,600
Get the fucking ludes.

3385
02:26:16,680 --> 02:26:17,850
I don't wanna die, Jordan!

3386
02:26:17,930 --> 02:26:19,110
I did a lot of bad shit.

3387
02:26:19,110 --> 02:26:20,640
I'm going to hell, Jordan!

3388
02:26:20,730 --> 02:26:23,600
I fucked up! I fucked up so bad!

3389
02:26:23,690 --> 02:26:25,690
Get the ludes! Downstairs!

3390
02:26:25,900 --> 02:26:27,110
What are you saying?

3391
02:26:27,610 --> 02:26:29,020
Fuck!

3392
02:26:29,900 --> 02:26:31,110
Get the ludes!

3393
02:26:31,190 --> 02:26:32,780
I can't go down there, Jordan. It's flooded.

3394
02:26:32,860 --> 02:26:34,110
It's three feet of water down there!

3395
02:26:34,200 --> 02:26:36,950
I will not die sober!

3396
02:26:37,030 --> 02:26:38,780
Get those fucking ludes!

3397
02:26:38,870 --> 02:26:39,910
Okay!

3398
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:41,330
- Go! - Okay.

3399
02:26:44,210 --> 02:26:45,960
- Where's he going? - Hold on, baby!

3400
02:26:46,040 --> 02:26:47,630
Donnie! Is he fucking crazy?

3401
02:26:47,710 --> 02:26:48,840
He's just warning everybody!

3402
02:27:01,060 --> 02:27:02,770
Jesus Christ!

3403
02:27:04,350 --> 02:27:05,520
Hold on!

3404
02:27:05,600 --> 02:27:07,060
Get away from the window!

3405
02:27:07,150 --> 02:27:08,520
Rogue wave!

3406
02:27:08,610 --> 02:27:09,650
Mayday!

3407
02:27:09,730 --> 02:27:12,320
This is Captain Ted Beecham aboard the yacht Naomi!

3408
02:27:12,400 --> 02:27:13,900
- We are going down! - I got 'em!

3409
02:27:14,360 --> 02:27:15,570
I got 'em!

3410
02:27:16,740 --> 02:27:18,280
Give me one for the nerves!

3411
02:27:18,370 --> 02:27:19,490
We're going down!

3412
02:27:19,580 --> 02:27:21,790
This is a fucking Mayday!

3413
02:27:21,870 --> 02:27:23,950
We require immediate assistance!

3414
02:27:26,210 --> 02:27:27,210
Hold on!

3415
02:27:27,290 --> 02:27:28,500
Watch out!

3416
02:27:40,180 --> 02:27:42,720
The nice thing about getting rescued by Italians

3417
02:27:43,020 --> 02:27:46,560
is that they feed you, make you drink red wine,

3418
02:27:46,650 --> 02:27:48,600
then you get to dance.

3419
02:28:05,210 --> 02:28:06,870
Did you see that?

3420
02:28:07,290 --> 02:28:10,210
That was the plane I sent to come get us.

3421
02:28:11,130 --> 02:28:14,880
I shit you not, it exploded when a seagull flew into the engine.

3422
02:28:14,970 --> 02:28:16,970
Three people killed.

3423
02:28:21,140 --> 02:28:22,970
You want a sign from God?

3424
02:28:23,060 --> 02:28:26,140
Well, after all this, I finally got the message.

3425
02:28:31,610 --> 02:28:35,230
Do you dream of becoming financially independent

3426
02:28:35,320 --> 02:28:37,990
but struggle every month just to pay your bills?

3427
02:28:38,070 --> 02:28:40,110
Would you like to own a home like this,

3428
02:28:40,120 --> 02:28:42,160
but can barely afford to pay your rent?

3429
02:28:42,240 --> 02:28:43,680
My name is Jordan Belfort,

3430
02:28:43,680 --> 02:28:45,950
and there's no secret to wealth creation.

3431
02:28:46,040 --> 02:28:48,540
No matter who you are, no matter where you came from,

3432
02:28:48,620 --> 02:28:51,210
you too can become financially independent

3433
02:28:51,290 --> 02:28:53,040
in just a matter of months.

3434
02:28:53,130 --> 02:28:55,250
All you need is a strategy.

3435
02:28:55,340 --> 02:28:56,960
When I was 24 years old,

3436
02:28:57,050 --> 02:29:00,880
I made a decision not just to survive, but to thrive.

3437
02:29:00,970 --> 02:29:03,430
At first I didn't feel like deals like these were possible.

3438
02:29:03,510 --> 02:29:06,930
But we have the house and we have a $33,000 profit.

3439
02:29:07,020 --> 02:29:08,140
I certainly believe now.

3440
02:29:08,230 --> 02:29:09,640
Think about it for a second.

3441
02:29:09,730 --> 02:29:11,850
If you don't have the guts to attend Jordan Belfort's

3442
02:29:11,940 --> 02:29:14,110
Straight Line Persuasion System Seminar,

3443
02:29:14,190 --> 02:29:15,770
then how do you expect to make any money?

3444
02:29:15,860 --> 02:29:17,940
If you want to be a millionaire someday,

3445
02:29:17,950 --> 02:29:19,610
have some guts. Make a decision.

3446
02:29:19,700 --> 02:29:20,630
Jordan Belfort's setup worked for me

3447
02:29:20,630 --> 02:29:22,450
because I worked hard for it.

3448
02:29:22,530 --> 02:29:25,080
And if it doesn't work for you, it's because you're lazy.

3449
02:29:25,160 --> 02:29:26,790
And you should get a job at McDonald's.

3450
02:29:26,870 --> 02:29:29,290
There's nobody holding you back from financial freedom.

3451
02:29:29,370 --> 02:29:32,290
And there's nobody stopping you from making millions.

3452
02:29:32,380 --> 02:29:33,630
Don't just sit at home,

3453
02:29:33,710 --> 02:29:36,340
or the life of your dreams will sail right past you.

3454
02:29:39,090 --> 02:29:42,720
I changed all these people's lives and I can change yours, too!

3455
02:29:42,800 --> 02:29:44,050
So come to my seminar!

3456
02:29:44,140 --> 02:29:45,510
The life of your dreams is only...

3457
02:29:45,600 --> 02:29:47,310
Good to see you again, Jordan.

3458
02:29:47,390 --> 02:29:48,470
You're under arrest!

3459
02:29:48,560 --> 02:29:50,140
You gotta be joking!

3460
02:29:51,390 --> 02:29:52,650
You're kidding me.

3461
02:29:52,730 --> 02:29:54,310
Hey, get the fuck away from me!

3462
02:29:54,400 --> 02:29:55,650
Turn that camera off.

3463
02:29:55,730 --> 02:29:57,730
I'm fucking shooting a fucking infomercial here,

3464
02:29:57,820 --> 02:29:59,190
you fucking cocksucker!

3465
02:29:59,280 --> 02:30:00,990
- Fuck you, you motherfucker! - Shut the fucking camera off.

3466
02:30:01,070 --> 02:30:02,820
You don't got shit on me, you hear me!

3467
02:30:02,910 --> 02:30:03,990
Go fuck yourself!

3468
02:30:04,070 --> 02:30:06,450
I'm making an honest living, you fucking piece of shit!

3469
02:30:06,530 --> 02:30:09,500
Hey, Jordan, let me give you a little legal advice.

3470
02:30:09,580 --> 02:30:11,000
Shut the fuck up!

3471
02:30:11,080 --> 02:30:12,620
Oh, fuck you, you fucking prick!

3472
02:30:12,710 --> 02:30:15,250
I'm making an honest living, you motherfucker!

3473
02:30:17,090 --> 02:30:21,170
I clean up my act. I did rehab. I'm a TV personality.

3474
02:30:21,260 --> 02:30:24,010
I'm sober for two years. And this happens!

3475
02:30:24,090 --> 02:30:26,300
Rugrat goes and gets busted down in Miami.

3476
02:30:26,390 --> 02:30:27,640
I'm Swiss, I'm not communist.

3477
02:30:27,720 --> 02:30:29,390
And guess who the fuck with? Saurel.

3478
02:30:29,470 --> 02:30:30,520
- You gonna beat me? - No, sir.

3479
02:30:30,600 --> 02:30:32,850
Yeah, I know your country. You're gonna beat me.

3480
02:30:32,940 --> 02:30:34,690
I mean, what are the fucking odds?

3481
02:30:34,770 --> 02:30:37,400
There had to be 10,000 Swiss bankers in Geneva,

3482
02:30:37,480 --> 02:30:38,960
and Rugrat gets the one dumb

3483
02:30:38,960 --> 02:30:41,280
enough to get himself arrested on U.S. Soil.

3484
02:30:41,360 --> 02:30:42,740
I know.

3485
02:30:42,860 --> 02:30:44,240
I'm so sorry.

3486
02:30:46,450 --> 02:30:47,660
Even more fucked was that

3487
02:30:47,740 --> 02:30:50,870
he got busted for shit that had nothing to do with me.

3488
02:30:50,950 --> 02:30:52,540
It had nothing to fucking do with me.

3489
02:30:52,620 --> 02:30:54,580
Something about laundering drug money

3490
02:30:54,670 --> 02:30:55,970
through offshore boat racing

3491
02:30:55,970 --> 02:30:57,750
and a guy named Rocky Aoki,

3492
02:30:57,840 --> 02:30:59,960
you know, the founder of Benihana.

3493
02:31:00,050 --> 02:31:01,380
Benihana.

3494
02:31:01,460 --> 02:31:05,340
Beni-fucking-hana!

3495
02:31:05,430 --> 02:31:06,390
Why?

3496
02:31:06,470 --> 02:31:07,850
Why, why, God?

3497
02:31:07,930 --> 02:31:09,390
Why would you be so cruel

3498
02:31:09,470 --> 02:31:12,060
as to choose a chain of fucking hibachi restaurants

3499
02:31:12,140 --> 02:31:13,390
to take me down?

3500
02:31:15,810 --> 02:31:18,270
Long story short. Saurel rats me out.

3501
02:31:18,360 --> 02:31:21,480
But not before he rats out Brad's wife, Chantalle,

3502
02:31:21,570 --> 02:31:23,180
who, it turns out,

3503
02:31:23,180 --> 02:31:25,650
he'd been fucking every time she went to Switzerland!

3504
02:31:27,660 --> 02:31:30,160
- No, no, no, it's impossible. - Oui, oui, oui.

3505
02:31:32,370 --> 02:31:34,160
All right!

3506
02:31:34,250 --> 02:31:37,750
One count engaging in conspiracy to commit securities fraud.

3507
02:31:37,830 --> 02:31:40,040
Two counts securities fraud.

3508
02:31:40,130 --> 02:31:43,590
One count engaging in conspiracy to commit money laundering.

3509
02:31:43,670 --> 02:31:45,920
Twenty-one counts money laundering.

3510
02:31:46,010 --> 02:31:48,390
One count obstruction of justice.

3511
02:31:49,430 --> 02:31:51,640
Bail is set at $10 million.

3512
02:32:06,860 --> 02:32:08,450
Uncle Donnie's here!

3513
02:32:09,240 --> 02:32:11,490
Rocky. How you doing?

3514
02:32:12,790 --> 02:32:14,450
I hate that fucking dog.

3515
02:32:14,540 --> 02:32:16,870
Yeah, he's getting old and decrepit.

3516
02:32:16,960 --> 02:32:18,460
Starting to shit in the house again.

3517
02:32:18,540 --> 02:32:20,250
- Me, too. - Come here, buddy.

3518
02:32:21,710 --> 02:32:23,340
- It's good to see you, pal. - Yeah, you, too.

3519
02:32:23,420 --> 02:32:27,220
Good to see you. Sit down. Oh, man.

3520
02:32:29,090 --> 02:32:30,390
How you doing, brother?

3521
02:32:31,220 --> 02:32:32,720
You know.

3522
02:32:32,810 --> 02:32:34,470
Shitty, pal.

3523
02:32:34,560 --> 02:32:36,680
But I'm hanging in there.

3524
02:32:38,020 --> 02:32:40,520
My new piece of jewelry. Check that out.

3525
02:32:40,610 --> 02:32:42,980
Can't leave the house, you know?

3526
02:32:43,070 --> 02:32:45,650
Starting to get cabin fever already.

3527
02:32:46,240 --> 02:32:47,780
Fucking Rugrat.

3528
02:32:48,360 --> 02:32:49,660
That wig-wearing faggot.

3529
02:32:49,740 --> 02:32:51,870
I can't believe that fucking guy. I wanna kill him.

3530
02:32:51,950 --> 02:32:54,540
Swear to God, I want to choke him to death.

3531
02:32:54,620 --> 02:32:56,910
Irresponsible little prick.

3532
02:32:57,040 --> 02:32:58,080
I'll tell you one thing.

3533
02:33:00,460 --> 02:33:02,960
I'm never eating at Benihana again.

3534
02:33:03,840 --> 02:33:06,000
I don't care whose birthday it is.

3535
02:33:07,420 --> 02:33:08,970
Where's Naomi? How's she doing?

3536
02:33:09,760 --> 02:33:11,050
That's her in the house there.

3537
02:33:11,140 --> 02:33:13,100
You could say hi, but she probably won't wave back.

3538
02:33:13,350 --> 02:33:14,970
Naomi, sweetheart!

3539
02:33:18,430 --> 02:33:19,690
What's up her ass?

3540
02:33:19,770 --> 02:33:21,310
- Is she mad at me? - No, you know...

3541
02:33:21,400 --> 02:33:22,860
We probably have to mortgage the house

3542
02:33:22,940 --> 02:33:24,730
in order to make bail.

3543
02:33:24,820 --> 02:33:26,270
Probably end up selling the

3544
02:33:26,270 --> 02:33:28,530
thing in order to pay for all the lawyers.

3545
02:33:28,610 --> 02:33:31,070
It's been a nightmare, buddy, to tell you the truth.

3546
02:33:31,320 --> 02:33:33,030
What are you gonna do, right?

3547
02:33:33,830 --> 02:33:36,660
Anyway, how's Stratton? That's more important.

3548
02:33:36,740 --> 02:33:37,830
How's morale?

3549
02:33:37,910 --> 02:33:40,540
They all pissed off 'cause they have to make money legally now?

3550
02:33:40,620 --> 02:33:42,080
Jordan.

3551
02:33:42,460 --> 02:33:44,880
I got the founding partners together.

3552
02:33:44,960 --> 02:33:47,380
I talked to them about everything.

3553
02:33:48,130 --> 02:33:49,130
And I got you.

3554
02:33:49,970 --> 02:33:51,550
What do you mean, you got me?

3555
02:33:52,720 --> 02:33:55,470
The house, money, don't worry about it. I got you.

3556
02:34:01,480 --> 02:34:03,600
- All right. - I love you, buddy.

3557
02:34:03,690 --> 02:34:05,610
- You know I'd do it for you, right? - I know.

3558
02:34:05,690 --> 02:34:07,650
- You know that, right? - I know.

3559
02:34:08,650 --> 02:34:09,780
I could fucking kiss you all over.

3560
02:34:09,860 --> 02:34:11,030
All right, enough, enough.

3561
02:34:13,110 --> 02:34:14,240
You want a beer, pal?

3562
02:34:14,320 --> 02:34:15,570
What are you drinking?

3563
02:34:15,660 --> 02:34:17,740
I got this non-alcoholic shit.

3564
02:34:17,830 --> 02:34:19,040
What's that?

3565
02:34:19,120 --> 02:34:22,120
A non-alcoholic beer. It's got no alcohol.

3566
02:34:22,210 --> 02:34:24,500
- It's a beer? - Yeah, with no alcohol.

3567
02:34:25,040 --> 02:34:26,290
But if you drink enough,

3568
02:34:26,380 --> 02:34:28,300
if you drink a lot, they get you fucked up?

3569
02:34:28,380 --> 02:34:30,460
No, there's no alcohol. That's the fucking point.

3570
02:34:30,550 --> 02:34:31,590
I'm not a scientist.

3571
02:34:31,670 --> 02:34:32,840
I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

3572
02:34:32,930 --> 02:34:34,510
I can get you a beer if you want a fucking beer.

3573
02:34:34,640 --> 02:34:36,760
I know, but I don't drink. You remember?

3574
02:34:36,850 --> 02:34:38,060
I don't drink anymore.

3575
02:34:38,140 --> 02:34:40,600
Oh, you wanna go inside and blow some lines of baking powder?

3576
02:34:40,680 --> 02:34:41,850
Or baking soda.

3577
02:34:42,640 --> 02:34:44,940
Can't imagine ever not enjoying getting fucked up.

3578
02:34:45,020 --> 02:34:46,440
- Yeah. - I love it.

3579
02:34:46,520 --> 02:34:48,070
How's being sober?

3580
02:34:48,150 --> 02:34:49,980
- Fucking sucks. - Boring, right?

3581
02:34:50,070 --> 02:34:52,490
So boring. I wanna kill myself.

3582
02:34:53,030 --> 02:34:55,570
There's a term, and we don't like to use it

3583
02:34:55,660 --> 02:34:57,120
unless circumstances dictate,

3584
02:34:57,200 --> 02:34:59,160
and I think they do dictate in this case,

3585
02:34:59,240 --> 02:35:00,660
and the term is "Grenada."

3586
02:35:00,750 --> 02:35:02,290
Have you ever heard of Grenada?

3587
02:35:02,370 --> 02:35:03,410
No. No, I haven't.

3588
02:35:03,540 --> 02:35:07,040
Grenada's very interesting because it is a small island nation

3589
02:35:07,130 --> 02:35:10,670
that was invaded by the United States of America in 1983.

3590
02:35:10,760 --> 02:35:12,840
It's about 90,000 people.

3591
02:35:12,920 --> 02:35:15,180
And essentially, it means

3592
02:35:15,930 --> 02:35:17,930
this case is unloseable.

3593
02:35:18,010 --> 02:35:19,100
Okay?

3594
02:35:19,180 --> 02:35:20,040
So, you know,

3595
02:35:20,040 --> 02:35:22,680
we can come in, we can have our dick hanging out of our pants.

3596
02:35:22,770 --> 02:35:23,930
Nobody gives a fuck.

3597
02:35:24,020 --> 02:35:25,560
I'm gonna win.

3598
02:35:25,730 --> 02:35:27,100
You, sir,

3599
02:35:28,650 --> 02:35:32,610
are what's known as a Grenada.

3600
02:35:35,740 --> 02:35:38,070
You're looking at real prison time.

3601
02:35:39,240 --> 02:35:41,580
Money laundering can get you as much as 20 years.

3602
02:35:42,580 --> 02:35:45,250
And our case couldn't be stronger if we caught you

3603
02:35:45,330 --> 02:35:47,000
shoving cash in your mattress.

3604
02:35:47,080 --> 02:35:48,130
Is that right?

3605
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:51,420
Hey, Jordan. Jordan.

3606
02:35:52,130 --> 02:35:55,970
Your rotting away in jail till your kids get out of college,

3607
02:35:56,050 --> 02:35:57,680
that's not our ambition here.

3608
02:35:59,100 --> 02:36:01,640
There's other people involved in this, too.

3609
02:36:01,720 --> 02:36:04,850
We think they need to see their day in court as well.

3610
02:36:07,440 --> 02:36:09,480
Why do I sense there's an offer in the air?

3611
02:36:09,560 --> 02:36:12,230
Look at him. He's got a sense. What are you, Kreskin?

3612
02:36:13,440 --> 02:36:16,190
Full cooperation. He provides us with a comprehensive list

3613
02:36:16,280 --> 02:36:18,660
of all the co-conspirators spanning the last seven years,

3614
02:36:18,740 --> 02:36:20,700
and he also agrees to wear a wire.

3615
02:36:20,780 --> 02:36:22,030
Wait...

3616
02:36:22,120 --> 02:36:23,870
did you just say "wear a wire"?

3617
02:36:23,950 --> 02:36:25,200
A wire.

3618
02:36:25,290 --> 02:36:26,660
What does that mean?

3619
02:36:26,750 --> 02:36:28,580
You want me to rat? Is that it?

3620
02:36:28,670 --> 02:36:29,960
No, I want you to cooperate.

3621
02:36:30,040 --> 02:36:30,960
No. You want me to rat, right?

3622
02:36:30,960 --> 02:36:31,960
Yes. We want you to rat.

3623
02:36:32,050 --> 02:36:35,880
That's fucking exactly what we want you to do. To rat.

3624
02:36:39,970 --> 02:36:41,800
How was Cristy's party?

3625
02:36:41,890 --> 02:36:42,970
Fine.

3626
02:36:43,060 --> 02:36:44,430
Good.

3627
02:36:45,600 --> 02:36:48,060
Babe, I spoke to the lawyers again today.

3628
02:36:48,140 --> 02:36:50,810
I have some really, really great news.

3629
02:36:52,650 --> 02:36:55,190
Turns out you're completely off the hook, honey.

3630
02:36:56,150 --> 02:36:57,820
I know that already.

3631
02:36:57,900 --> 02:36:59,400
Right. Exactly.

3632
02:36:59,490 --> 02:37:02,700
You never did anything wrong in the first place, right?

3633
02:37:03,660 --> 02:37:05,870
It turns out, all the FBI really

3634
02:37:06,540 --> 02:37:10,210
wants from me is to cooperate.

3635
02:37:10,460 --> 02:37:11,670
You know?

3636
02:37:11,750 --> 02:37:12,710
Turns out I have so much

3637
02:37:12,710 --> 02:37:14,750
information about the stock market and Wall Street,

3638
02:37:14,840 --> 02:37:16,630
I could save the government years of heartache,

3639
02:37:16,710 --> 02:37:19,340
not to mention countless dollars.

3640
02:37:20,840 --> 02:37:23,180
But it gets even better, babe.

3641
02:37:23,640 --> 02:37:26,180
Because if I do decide to cooperate,

3642
02:37:26,560 --> 02:37:29,390
I might only be looking at four short years,

3643
02:37:29,480 --> 02:37:30,940
in which case, you know,

3644
02:37:31,020 --> 02:37:34,060
we could start fresh, maybe sell the house.

3645
02:37:34,150 --> 02:37:35,770
And any fines that I'd have to pay

3646
02:37:35,860 --> 02:37:37,650
wouldn't be due till after I serve my term,

3647
02:37:37,740 --> 02:37:40,030
so we'd still have plenty of money left over, you know?

3648
02:37:42,700 --> 02:37:45,120
The only thing that of course bummed me out a little bit

3649
02:37:45,200 --> 02:37:46,830
is this whole idea of

3650
02:37:46,830 --> 02:37:50,250
having to give information about my friends.

3651
02:37:50,330 --> 02:37:53,540
Like you said, "There's no friends on Wall Street." Right?

3652
02:37:53,630 --> 02:37:55,590
Right. Right. Exactly.

3653
02:37:55,670 --> 02:37:57,250
There's a silver lining to that, too, honey.

3654
02:37:57,340 --> 02:37:59,010
Because they said eventually...

3655
02:37:59,090 --> 02:38:00,020
eventually everyone's

3656
02:38:00,020 --> 02:38:01,970
gonna have to give information on this case.

3657
02:38:02,050 --> 02:38:03,150
So, at the end of the day,

3658
02:38:03,150 --> 02:38:04,850
it might not even be a factor. You know?

3659
02:38:04,930 --> 02:38:07,060
Well, that's good news. Right?

3660
02:38:07,180 --> 02:38:08,890
Yeah, yeah.

3661
02:38:08,980 --> 02:38:10,680
I'm really happy for you.

3662
02:38:12,060 --> 02:38:15,310
What do you mean, happy for me, sweetheart?

3663
02:38:16,230 --> 02:38:18,820
You should be happy for the both of us. Right?

3664
02:38:18,900 --> 02:38:20,860
- Yeah, right. - All right.

3665
02:38:22,950 --> 02:38:24,570
Come here, baby.

3666
02:38:25,070 --> 02:38:26,620
Give me a kiss, sweetheart.

3667
02:38:26,700 --> 02:38:27,700
Jordan...

3668
02:38:27,790 --> 02:38:28,990
Oh, come on, baby.

3669
02:38:29,080 --> 02:38:31,290
I haven't made love to you in so long. Please.

3670
02:38:31,370 --> 02:38:33,790
- No. Jordan, stop it. - Come on, honey, please.

3671
02:38:33,880 --> 02:38:35,290
No! Jordan, stop it!

3672
02:38:37,040 --> 02:38:39,250
I've loved you since the moment I saw you.

3673
02:38:43,130 --> 02:38:45,010
I fucking hate you, Jordan.

3674
02:38:45,600 --> 02:38:48,140
- Get off me! - Baby... don't do that.

3675
02:38:49,020 --> 02:38:50,930
You know how much I love you, right?

3676
02:38:51,430 --> 02:38:53,600
Stop that, sweetie. Please.

3677
02:38:58,860 --> 02:39:00,900
You wanna fuck me, Jordan?

3678
02:39:02,650 --> 02:39:04,360
You wanna fuck me?

3679
02:39:05,360 --> 02:39:06,490
Good.

3680
02:39:06,570 --> 02:39:07,910
Go ahead.

3681
02:39:08,410 --> 02:39:10,330
Go ahead and fuck me.

3682
02:39:11,410 --> 02:39:13,830
I want you to fuck me real hard.

3683
02:39:13,960 --> 02:39:16,630
I want you to fuck me like it's the last fucking time.

3684
02:39:16,710 --> 02:39:18,040
- Why are you moving like that? - Come on.

3685
02:39:18,130 --> 02:39:19,090
Please hold still.

3686
02:39:19,170 --> 02:39:20,710
'Cause I want you to come for me, baby.

3687
02:39:20,800 --> 02:39:22,130
Come on, babe.

3688
02:39:22,220 --> 02:39:23,720
Come for me, baby.

3689
02:39:23,800 --> 02:39:25,010
I want you to come for me

3690
02:39:25,090 --> 02:39:26,550
like it's the last fucking time.

3691
02:39:26,640 --> 02:39:28,090
- Yeah? - Yeah.

3692
02:39:28,180 --> 02:39:30,760
Come on, baby. Come for me. Come for me, baby.

3693
02:39:30,850 --> 02:39:31,970
Come on, baby.

3694
02:39:32,060 --> 02:39:33,390
- Yeah? - Yeah.

3695
02:39:33,480 --> 02:39:35,390
- Yeah, baby, come. - You want me to come for you?

3696
02:39:35,480 --> 02:39:36,650
Yeah.

3697
02:39:37,480 --> 02:39:39,440
- You want me to come for you? - Yeah!

3698
02:39:39,520 --> 02:39:41,860
Huh? You want me to come for you?

3699
02:39:43,690 --> 02:39:45,400
Oh, God, baby. Yeah!

3700
02:39:45,490 --> 02:39:47,990
Oh, God. Oh, God.

3701
02:39:49,330 --> 02:39:53,750
Oh, God.

3702
02:39:53,830 --> 02:39:55,080
Jesus.

3703
02:39:58,710 --> 02:40:00,040
Oh, baby.

3704
02:40:00,130 --> 02:40:02,630
That was so fucking great!

3705
02:40:02,710 --> 02:40:04,010
Oh, God!

3706
02:40:06,340 --> 02:40:08,300
That was the last time.

3707
02:40:08,800 --> 02:40:10,760
What do you mean, baby?

3708
02:40:10,850 --> 02:40:13,810
I mean that was the last time we ever have sex.

3709
02:40:14,810 --> 02:40:16,850
What are you talking about?

3710
02:40:18,850 --> 02:40:20,520
I want a divorce.

3711
02:40:22,110 --> 02:40:24,110
What do you mean, you want a divorce?

3712
02:40:24,190 --> 02:40:26,240
What's that supposed to mean, you want a divorce?

3713
02:40:26,320 --> 02:40:28,200
Get off me! I want a divorce.

3714
02:40:28,530 --> 02:40:29,780
You just made love to me.

3715
02:40:29,870 --> 02:40:30,950
What the fuck is wrong with you?

3716
02:40:31,030 --> 02:40:33,370
I don't love you anymore, Jordan!

3717
02:40:34,660 --> 02:40:36,620
Oh, you don't love me?

3718
02:40:37,040 --> 02:40:38,620
You don't love me anymore, huh?

3719
02:40:38,710 --> 02:40:40,960
Well, isn't that just fucking convenient for you!

3720
02:40:41,040 --> 02:40:42,880
Now that I'm under federal indictment,

3721
02:40:42,960 --> 02:40:44,920
with an electronic bracelet around my ankle,

3722
02:40:45,010 --> 02:40:46,720
now you decide you don't fucking love me anymore.

3723
02:40:46,800 --> 02:40:48,550
- Is that right? - No, no.

3724
02:40:48,880 --> 02:40:51,140
What kind of person are you? Tell me.

3725
02:40:51,220 --> 02:40:52,470
You married me!

3726
02:40:52,560 --> 02:40:54,060
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

3727
02:40:54,140 --> 02:40:55,810
Jordan, this is how it's gonna go.

3728
02:40:55,890 --> 02:40:58,060
I'm gonna take custody of the kids.

3729
02:40:58,140 --> 02:41:01,690
If you agree to the divorce right now, I will allow visitation.

3730
02:41:01,810 --> 02:41:03,650
- Okay? Don't try to fight it. - Oh, my God.

3731
02:41:03,730 --> 02:41:05,250
It'll save us both a lot of money

3732
02:41:05,260 --> 02:41:07,900
and I got a feeling you're gonna need it.

3733
02:41:09,450 --> 02:41:12,660
You're not taking my kids, sweetheart. You hear me?

3734
02:41:12,740 --> 02:41:14,160
I've already talked to the lawyer.

3735
02:41:14,240 --> 02:41:15,490
He said even if you don't get convicted,

3736
02:41:15,580 --> 02:41:16,660
I've got a good chance of getting them.

3737
02:41:16,750 --> 02:41:17,830
I got news for you.

3738
02:41:17,910 --> 02:41:19,820
You're not fucking taking my children,

3739
02:41:19,830 --> 02:41:21,330
you vicious fucking cunt, you!

3740
02:41:21,880 --> 02:41:23,840
Fuck you, you fucking bitch!

3741
02:41:23,920 --> 02:41:26,090
You're not fucking taking my goddamn fucking kids!

3742
02:41:26,170 --> 02:41:27,550
You hear me? Fuck you!

3743
02:41:27,760 --> 02:41:30,510
You're not fucking taking my fucking kids!

3744
02:41:39,100 --> 02:41:40,890
Fucking bitch!

3745
02:41:43,360 --> 02:41:44,730
Fucking whore!

3746
02:41:49,110 --> 02:41:51,780
Fucking bitch! Piece of shit fucking whore!

3747
02:42:00,960 --> 02:42:03,710
Look at yourself, Jordan.

3748
02:42:03,790 --> 02:42:04,960
You're sick!

3749
02:42:05,040 --> 02:42:06,210
You're a sick man!

3750
02:42:06,300 --> 02:42:08,340
Fuck you! I told you, you're not taking my fucking kids!

3751
02:42:08,420 --> 02:42:10,880
You think I would let my kids near you?

3752
02:42:10,970 --> 02:42:12,130
Look at yourself!

3753
02:42:12,220 --> 02:42:13,720
You know what my lawyer said?

3754
02:42:13,800 --> 02:42:17,260
My lawyer said that you're going to prison for 20 years, Jordan.

3755
02:42:17,350 --> 02:42:20,600
Twenty fucking years! You're never gonna see the kids again!

3756
02:42:20,680 --> 02:42:21,890
You don't think I'm not gonna see my...

3757
02:42:21,980 --> 02:42:23,730
No, I'm not fucking letting you near my kids!

3758
02:42:23,810 --> 02:42:25,980
You don't think I'm gonna see my fucking kids again, huh?

3759
02:42:26,070 --> 02:42:27,610
Don't you fucking touch them!

3760
02:42:28,940 --> 02:42:30,740
Don't you fucking touch me!

3761
02:42:32,450 --> 02:42:35,700
Sweetheart? You're coming on a trip with Daddy, all right?

3762
02:42:35,780 --> 02:42:37,740
You're coming on a trip with Daddy.

3763
02:42:40,500 --> 02:42:42,750
Don't you fucking touch her, Jordan.

3764
02:42:42,830 --> 02:42:45,580
I swear to God, I will fucking kill you!

3765
02:42:48,250 --> 02:42:49,500
It's all right, baby.

3766
02:42:49,590 --> 02:42:52,300
You and Daddy are gonna go on a little trip together, okay?

3767
02:42:52,380 --> 02:42:53,930
- A little trip together. - Violet!

3768
02:42:54,010 --> 02:42:55,090
Violet!

3769
02:42:55,180 --> 02:42:57,390
- Get the key! Get the key! - I got it!

3770
02:42:57,470 --> 02:42:59,100
Jordan, you open this fucking door

3771
02:42:59,180 --> 02:43:01,980
- right now! Open the door! - Put your seat belt on.

3772
02:43:02,060 --> 02:43:03,390
There you go. Get your legs in.

3773
02:43:03,480 --> 02:43:05,100
I'm taking her with me!

3774
02:43:05,190 --> 02:43:07,810
I told you I'm taking her with me, you fucking bitch!

3775
02:43:07,900 --> 02:43:10,610
You're not gonna stop me! You're not gonna stop me!

3776
02:43:11,400 --> 02:43:13,490
We're going on a little trip, honey.

3777
02:43:13,900 --> 02:43:15,410
No! No!

3778
02:43:16,030 --> 02:43:17,410
Get the hell out of here!

3779
02:43:17,490 --> 02:43:19,620
Leave that baby alone!

3780
02:43:19,700 --> 02:43:21,870
Violet! Garage door! Close it!

3781
02:43:21,950 --> 02:43:23,080
Mommy!

3782
02:43:23,210 --> 02:43:25,370
- Get out of here! - Open the fucking door!

3783
02:43:26,290 --> 02:43:27,420
Mommy!

3784
02:43:30,460 --> 02:43:32,090
No!

3785
02:43:39,390 --> 02:43:42,140
Oh, Lord! Oh, my heavens...

3786
02:43:42,220 --> 02:43:43,520
Get the baby!

3787
02:43:43,600 --> 02:43:45,730
Naomi, get the baby!

3788
02:43:46,480 --> 02:43:48,150
- Mommy. - Honey, it's okay.

3789
02:43:48,230 --> 02:43:49,480
It's gonna be okay.

3790
02:43:49,570 --> 02:43:51,570
Oh, Mr. Jordan has lost his mind.

3791
02:43:52,570 --> 02:43:54,360
- Baby... - It's all right, honey.

3792
02:43:54,450 --> 02:43:56,030
She all right?

3793
02:43:56,110 --> 02:43:57,410
Is she all right?

3794
02:43:58,160 --> 02:43:59,740
What's the matter with you?

3795
02:43:59,990 --> 02:44:01,330
Is she all right?

3796
02:44:08,710 --> 02:44:10,080
Paragraph one.

3797
02:44:10,170 --> 02:44:11,670
The defendant shall plead guilty

3798
02:44:11,750 --> 02:44:15,170
to all counts of the indictment currently pending against him

3799
02:44:15,260 --> 02:44:16,800
in the United States District Court

3800
02:44:16,800 --> 02:44:19,090
for the Eastern District of New York.

3801
02:44:19,600 --> 02:44:20,680
Paragraph two.

3802
02:44:20,760 --> 02:44:21,890
Talk normally.

3803
02:44:21,970 --> 02:44:25,180
The defendant shall participate in undercover activities...

3804
02:44:25,270 --> 02:44:26,390
Breathe normally.

3805
02:44:26,480 --> 02:44:30,020
... including wearing a recording device, also known as a wire...

3806
02:44:30,110 --> 02:44:32,270
After five minutes, you'll forget you even have it on.

3807
02:44:32,360 --> 02:44:33,480
...in conjunction with the investigation...

3808
02:44:33,570 --> 02:44:35,110
Fucking brutal.

3809
02:44:35,240 --> 02:44:36,490
Quit your bitching.

3810
02:44:36,570 --> 02:44:38,400
Paragraph four. The defendant must not commit,

3811
02:44:38,490 --> 02:44:40,660
or attempt to commit, any further crimes.

3812
02:44:40,740 --> 02:44:44,200
Please. Let me just sign the fucking thing already.

3813
02:44:44,290 --> 02:44:45,660
Thank you.

3814
02:44:48,620 --> 02:44:49,790
Just here?

3815
02:44:49,880 --> 02:44:51,420
That'd be good.

3816
02:44:53,130 --> 02:44:54,250
Thank you.

3817
02:44:54,340 --> 02:44:55,960
It wasn't even a choice.

3818
02:44:57,010 --> 02:45:00,010
For the next six hours, I came up with a list.

3819
02:45:00,300 --> 02:45:03,220
Friends, enemies, business associates.

3820
02:45:03,310 --> 02:45:04,880
Anybody who'd ever known me or

3821
02:45:04,880 --> 02:45:07,390
taken so much as a stock tip.

3822
02:45:12,940 --> 02:45:15,230
Wolfie! Wolfie! Wolfie!

3823
02:45:17,030 --> 02:45:19,820
The first name on the list was Donnie.

3824
02:45:22,200 --> 02:45:23,290
Jordan, do you know how

3825
02:45:23,290 --> 02:45:25,330
good it is to have you back in this office?

3826
02:45:25,700 --> 02:45:27,750
It's not the same when you're gone.

3827
02:45:27,830 --> 02:45:29,580
It's sad, you understand? It's like...

3828
02:45:29,670 --> 02:45:31,080
That fucking Steve Madden, huh?

3829
02:45:31,170 --> 02:45:32,330
I can't...

3830
02:45:32,420 --> 02:45:34,250
Swear to God, I can't even think about it.

3831
02:45:34,340 --> 02:45:36,210
Every time I think about him, my blood boils.

3832
02:45:36,300 --> 02:45:37,960
I can't even say his name.

3833
02:45:38,050 --> 02:45:39,590
- I know. - It's, like, disgusting.

3834
02:45:39,680 --> 02:45:42,050
I grew up with this guy and he betrays me like that.

3835
02:45:43,350 --> 02:45:46,260
He ever get back to you about that...

3836
02:45:47,020 --> 02:45:48,770
about that account?

3838
02:45:54,610 --> 02:45:55,650
You remember.

3839
02:45:55,730 --> 02:45:57,730
It was like four or five mil, something like that, right?

3840
02:45:57,820 --> 02:46:00,950
He was supposed to kick back four or five mil, was it?

3841
02:46:05,370 --> 02:46:06,830
Actually, I was...

3842
02:46:06,910 --> 02:46:08,290
I was fucked up, Jordan,

3843
02:46:08,370 --> 02:46:09,870
- so I don't really remember. - Yeah.

3844
02:46:09,960 --> 02:46:11,960
Yeah, right. Stupid.

3845
02:46:12,630 --> 02:46:16,630
Well, if he calls you, you make sure and contact me, okay?

3846
02:46:18,460 --> 02:46:20,130
- Yeah. Of course. - Yeah.

3847
02:46:20,220 --> 02:46:22,300
Of course, yeah. No, of course.

3848
02:46:25,720 --> 02:46:28,220
You gonna eat that last piece of yellowtail, bud?

3849
02:46:29,270 --> 02:46:31,020
No, it's all yours.

3850
02:46:31,850 --> 02:46:33,190
Can I get this?

3851
02:46:35,690 --> 02:46:37,400
So, what else is...

3852
02:46:40,150 --> 02:46:42,150
Well, how's Naomi and everything?

3853
02:46:42,240 --> 02:46:43,660
You know how it is.

3854
02:46:43,740 --> 02:46:45,820
She hates my fucking guts.

3855
02:46:47,580 --> 02:46:49,240
How's Hildy? Good?

3856
02:46:50,080 --> 02:46:53,670
She's still alive, so my life is fucked, you know?

3857
02:46:53,750 --> 02:46:54,920
Yeah.

3858
02:47:01,760 --> 02:47:03,260
Mr. Jordan.

3859
02:47:04,930 --> 02:47:07,100
Mr. Jordan, you got a visitor.

3860
02:47:07,470 --> 02:47:08,510
What?

3861
02:47:08,970 --> 02:47:10,770
You've got a visitor.

3862
02:47:26,280 --> 02:47:28,280
I need you to get dressed.

3863
02:47:28,370 --> 02:47:30,580
Why? What the fuck's going on?

3864
02:47:35,620 --> 02:47:37,420
You're going to jail.

3865
02:47:49,350 --> 02:47:50,560
All right.

3866
02:47:50,640 --> 02:47:52,220
I'll get some clothes on.

3867
02:47:52,310 --> 02:47:54,640
We'll give you a hand with that.

3868
02:48:03,240 --> 02:48:04,320
Okay.

3869
02:48:16,540 --> 02:48:17,790
FBI!

3870
02:48:18,210 --> 02:48:19,390
Everybody sit down.

3871
02:48:19,390 --> 02:48:21,790
Put your hands where they can be seen, and shut up!

3872
02:48:21,880 --> 02:48:23,590
Don't you fucking touch me.

3873
02:48:23,670 --> 02:48:25,800
Get your fucking hands off me!

3874
02:48:25,880 --> 02:48:27,630
Don't get out of your seats!

3875
02:48:40,860 --> 02:48:42,480
It's fucking Chanel!

3876
02:48:55,120 --> 02:48:57,210
I gave up everyone.

3877
02:48:57,370 --> 02:48:58,870
And in return,

3878
02:48:58,960 --> 02:49:00,570
I got three years in some

3879
02:49:00,570 --> 02:49:03,340
hellhole in Nevada I'd never even heard of.

3880
02:49:05,210 --> 02:49:07,590
Like my pops, Mad Max, had said,

3881
02:49:08,380 --> 02:49:10,970
"The chickens had come home to roost."

3882
02:49:12,390 --> 02:49:14,600
Whatever the fuck that means.

3883
02:49:18,190 --> 02:49:19,480
I hope Your Honor would agree

3884
02:49:19,560 --> 02:49:21,560
that Mr. Belfort has distinguished himself

3885
02:49:21,650 --> 02:49:23,730
in terms of his cooperation.

3886
02:49:23,820 --> 02:49:25,860
Mr. Belfort has helped the government win convictions

3887
02:49:25,940 --> 02:49:28,490
of over two dozen serious offenders

3888
02:49:29,740 --> 02:49:31,660
and helped them recover millions of dollars

3889
02:49:31,740 --> 02:49:35,160
to be made available for restitution to their victims.

3890
02:49:37,410 --> 02:49:38,850
The sentence of the court shall be

3891
02:49:38,850 --> 02:49:41,080
36 months in federal prison.

3892
02:49:42,920 --> 02:49:45,040
Please remand the defendant.

3893
02:49:47,260 --> 02:49:48,970
I'm sorry.

3894
02:49:51,890 --> 02:49:52,930
That's okay.

3896
02:50:41,310 --> 02:50:43,730
I'm not ashamed to admit it.

3897
02:50:43,810 --> 02:50:45,650
When we arrived at the prison,

3898
02:50:45,730 --> 02:50:47,900
I was absolutely terrified.

3899
02:50:48,690 --> 02:50:50,070
Belfort, on your feet.

3900
02:50:50,150 --> 02:50:52,450
But I needn't have been.

3901
02:50:52,650 --> 02:50:55,280
You see, for a brief fleeting moment,

3902
02:50:55,990 --> 02:50:58,030
I'd forgotten I was rich.

3903
02:50:59,040 --> 02:51:02,500
And I lived in a place where everything was for sale.

3904
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:07,710
Wouldn't you like to learn how to sell it?

3905
02:51:07,790 --> 02:51:10,670
So listen. I've met some bad motherfuckers in my life.

3906
02:51:10,760 --> 02:51:14,220
I'm talking about rock stars, professional athletes, gangsters.

3907
02:51:14,300 --> 02:51:16,090
I'm telling you, some real bad motherfuckers.

3908
02:51:16,180 --> 02:51:18,470
But this guy, my good friend,

3909
02:51:18,560 --> 02:51:21,310
Mr. Jordan Belfort, is the single

3910
02:51:21,390 --> 02:51:24,190
baddest motherfucker I have ever met.

3911
02:51:24,730 --> 02:51:26,440
So I want you right now

3912
02:51:26,520 --> 02:51:29,650
to give a warm Auckland, New Zealand welcome

3913
02:51:29,730 --> 02:51:34,110
for my good friend and the world's greatest sales trainer,

3914
02:51:34,200 --> 02:51:36,450
Mr. Jordan Belfort!

3915
02:51:47,420 --> 02:51:48,710
Thank you.

3916
02:52:11,690 --> 02:52:13,400
