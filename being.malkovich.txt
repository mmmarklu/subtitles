「第七樓半」
[ Man ] Welcome to
the seven and a half floor
of the Mertin Flemmer Building.
歡迎來到馬丁弗蘭大廈的
七樓半
既然你要開始在這上班…
As you'll now be spending
your work day here, it is important...
對於這出名的七樓半歷史
也該有所瞭解
that you learn a bit about the history
of this famous floor.
哈羅！唐
- Hello, Don.
- Hello, Wendy.
哈羅！溫蒂
Don, I was wondering,
do you know why...
唐，為什麼這裡的屋頂這麼低
our workplace
has such low ceilings?
那是一個很有趣的故事
It's an interesting story.
Many years ago in the late 1 800s...
一八零零年的晚期
James Mertin, an I rish ship captain,
came to this town...
愛爾蘭船長，詹姆士馬丁
來到這個城市
決定興建一座辦公大樓
and decided to erect
an office building.
He called this building the
Mertin Flemmer Building after himself...
名為馬丁弗蘭大廈
以他自己及其他同名者命名
and someone else, who local legend
has it was named Flemmer.
因為他是當時的傳奇人物
許多人都因他改名
Well, one day, old Captain Mertin
received an unexpected visitor.
有一天老船長
接見一位陌生訪客
- Captain Mertin?
- Aye. What want ye, girl child?
是馬丁船長嗎
是的，小女孩你想要什麼
I'm not a child, but rather
an adult lady of miniature proportions.
我不是小孩
而是一個成熟的迷你女人
如果是為了捐錢
你給我滾得遠遠的
I see. Well, if it's
charity you're after...
be gone with ye,
you foul demon!
我不是來要救濟金
I'm not asking for alms...
只是想請你這位高貴的紳士
聽我一句話
but, rather, the ear of a kind man
with a noble heart.
[ Captain ]
Well, speak then, if you must.
那就請你快講吧
船長，在建築時大家都忽略
我們這些迷你體型的人
Captain Mertin, I'm afraid that
the world was not built with me in mind.
Doorknobs are too high,
chairs are unwieldy...
門把太高，椅子太笨重
and high-ceilinged rooms
mock my stature.
而高屋頂好像在
嘲笑我們的體型
Why cannot there be a place for me
to work that's safe and comfortable?
為什麼不能為我設計一個
既安全又舒適的地方
[ Captain ]
Thy story has moved me like no other.
這個故事太感人
我因此決定…
Therefore, I shall make ye--
[ Groans ] me wife.
娶你為妻
And-- And I shall build
a floor for ye...
我將在大廈的七與八樓之間
特地為你建造一層樓
between the seventh and the eighth
in me own building...
so at least there'll be one place
on God's green earth...
使你與其他不幸的朋友
where ye and your accursed kind
can live in peace.
有個安全舒適的地方
So that's the story
of seven and a half.
這就是七樓半的由來
Since the rents are considerably lower,
this floor has been adopted...
由於房租便宜
特別受到商業朋友的喜愛
by businesses which,
for one reason or another,
have been forced to cut corners.
After all, the overhead is low.
不管如何，可以降低成本嘛

and see if this job thing pays off.
再等等，看工作有沒有進展
好嗎？
- You know?
- Okay.
上次你說工作簡介的卡帶
是胡說八道
I was thinking about
what you were saying...
- about the orientation film
being bullshit.
- Yes?
I think maybe
you're on to something.
我想你別有所圖
太多的開場白
能讓女人脫掉褲子
- And 50 other lines

- [ Laughs ] No, no!
不，我只是問你有關影片的事
No, I was just talking about the--
you know, about the film.

依我來看
If you ever got me, you wouldn't have
a clue what to do with me.
就算你得到我
也不知道該如何逗我開心

如果我年輕八十歲
一定要好好揍你一頓
先生，我沒有玩弄她
我不會…
I wasn't toying with her, sir.
I wouldn't --
- Pardon me. How old are you, sir?
- 1 05.
先生，你多大年紀
一百零五歲
多喝胡蘿葡汁，使你青春長駐
Carrot juice, and lots of it.
I swear, sometimes it's not worth it.
I piss orange.
但並不值得
因為我的小便是橘紅色
頻頻撒尿
而且像女人一樣，要坐著小便
And I have to piss sitting down...
like a goddamn girly-girl,
every 1 5 minutes.
- Mm.
- But nobody wants to die.
沒人想死
Ah, to be a young man again,
eh, Schwartz? [ Laughs ]
啊！再變年輕
弗蘿也許會喜歡我
Maybe then Floris
would care for me.
But the elderly have so much to offer,
sir. They're our link with history.
但老年人是無價的
他們是我們與歷史的聯繫
I don't wanna be

I want to feel Floris's
naked thighs next to mine.
我要撫摸弗蘿光裸的大腿
I want my body to inspire lust...
我要和她做愛

I want her to shiver
with a spasm of ecstasy...
我要她顫抖，因狂喜而痙攣
當我進入她的…
Schwartz, as I penetrate her wet--
萊斯特博士
感謝你和我分享你的感受
Dr. Lester, while I'm flattered
you would share your feelings with me...
perhaps the workplace is not
the most suitable environment
for this type of discussion.
但在工作場所談論性愛
好像不太適合
不錯，你說的對
All right. You're right.

那麼下班後

Interesting, Craig.
非常有趣
你想不想到我身體之內
Would you like
to be inside my skin...
think what I think,
feel what I feel?
想我所想
感覺我所感覺的
More than anything, Maxine.
那是我最想做的事
It's good in here, Craig.
這裡是這麼的性感
It's better than
your wildest dreams.
連你那最狂野的夢都比不上
You're not somebody
I could get interested in, Craig.
我對你不感興趣
You play with dolls.
你玩娃娃
Puppets, Maxine. It's the idea
of being inside someone else's skin...
瑪馨，是木偶
主要的概念是進入別人的身體
- and seeing what they see
and feeling what they feel.
- Yikes!
看他所看的，觸摸他所觸摸的
恐怖
- It's just that, well--
Please let me explain.
- [ Elevator Bell Dings ]
給我一個機會解釋好嗎
- [ Alarm Ringing ]
- I've never done this before, but...
我從來沒做過這種事
對你，我有種從未有過的感覺
I feel something for you,
and I've never felt this way before...
you know, about anybody,
n-not even my wife.
即使對我太太
也沒有這種特別的感覺
And I just-- I really feel
that you and I belong together, Maxine.
我們是天造地設的一對

- Yeah. I thought you were
all right in that one movie.
- Thank you.
在那部電影裡你演的很好
謝謝
The one where you played
a jewel thief.
就是你演珠寶大盜的那部
- I never played a jewel thief.
- No?

- Better be.
拜託，很重要
最好如此
It is.
我保證
在我辦公室裡有個小門
There's a tiny door
in my office, Maxine.
It's a portal,
and it takes you inside John Malkovich.
它是帶你進入
約翰麥可維奇體內的入口
You see the world
through John Malkovich's eyes...
你從約翰的眼裡看世界
and then after about 1 5 minutes,
you're spit out...
十五分鐘後，被吐出來
掉到紐澤西收費公路旁的溝裡
into a ditch on the side
of the New Jersey Turnpike.
Sounds great!
Who the fuck is John Malkovich?
聽起來很偉大
約翰是哪個鬼？
Oh, he's an actor. He's one of the great
American actors of the 2 0th century.
他是二十世紀美國偉大的演員
Oh, yeah?
What's he been in?
演過什麼？
Lots of things.
That jewel thief movie, for example.
很多，珠寶大盜就是其中之一
He's very well respected.
Anyway, the point is...
大家都尊重他
重點是…
這件事很奇妙
this is a very odd thing.
It's supernatural,
for lack of a better word.
它是超自然的
實在找不出更好的形容辭
I mean, it raises
all sorts of philosophical-type
questions, you know...
這會引起各種哲學上的疑問
about the nature of self,
about the existence of a soul.
例如，        自然的本性
靈魂的存在等
You know, am I me?
Is Malkovich Malkovich?
我是我嗎？還是約翰呢
I had a piece of wood in my hand.
剛剛我手裡有個木片
現在卻沒有，到哪去了
I don't have it anymore.
Where is it?
消失了嗎？怎麼可能
Did it disappear?
How could that be?
還是仍在約翰的腦袋裡？
我不知道
Is it still in Malkovich's head?
I don't know!
Do you see what a metaphysical
can of worms this portal is?
你看這個入口
是多麼的抽像和神奇
我無法再回到以前的生活方式
I don't see how I could go on living
my life the way I've lived it before.
[ Phone Ringing ]
- Yeah?
- So I've been thinking,
is this Malkovich fellow appealing?
這個叫約翰的傢伙有名嗎
瑪馨，他當然有名
Maxine! Yes, of course, Maxine.
He's a celebrity.
那好，我們可以賣票
Good. We'll sell tickets.
- Tickets to Malkovich?
- Exactly.
到約翰體內的票
不錯，兩百塊一張
Two hundred dollars a pop.
But, Maxine, there's something,
I don't know, like profound here.
但是瑪馨，這件事十分神秘
I don't know if maybe
we should exploit it. You think?
不知道該不該暴露它
你說呢？
I need you for this, Craigy.
You're my man on the inside.
克雷，我要你到他體內
和我做愛
You need me?
I'm your man?
你要我
和你做愛？
- Sure, whatever.
- [ Door Opens, Dog Barks ]
當然，絕對沒問題
- Hey, everybody, I'm home.

- Treats for everyone.
- [ Whispers ] Maxine?
但是瑪馨…
- [ Maxine ] Yeah?
- We don't know
the significance of this thing.
我們對這件事的內涵並不瞭解
也許會很危險
- It might be dangerous to toy with?
- [ Lotte Chattering ]

Well, I'll protect you, doll face.
- Bye-bye.
- [ Dog Barking ]

- Who was that?
- [ Elijah Shrieking ]
那是誰
I'm going to be working a lot
of late nights with this partner...
我將會和我的合夥人
每天工作到很晚
because Lestercorp's open
during the day, so I'll be
working a lot of late nights.
因為公司白天上班
只好利用晚上了
But it's a good thing, 'cause it's gonna
get us out of the hole financially...
好處是可以賺很多錢
我們不必再負債纍纍了
'cause we're gonna
turn it into a business.
我仍搞不懂
But I don't understand.
There's not--
絕對沒有能進入別人
腦裡的洞或是入口
There's no such thing as a hole,
or a portal, into somebody's brain.
相信我，有的
進入別人腦裡或靈魂裡
Yes, there is.
A brain, or soul or whatever.
I was inside John Malkovich lookin' out.
我曾經在約翰的體內往外看
真的？
- Really?
- Yep.
我要試試
你說什麼？
- I wanna try it.
- Pardon me?
I want to be
John Malkovich, tomorrow.
明天我要成為約翰
That'd be perfect,
'cause then I can meet your partner.
正好可以見見你的合夥人
但是公司白天上班
不能白天去
The thing is, Lestercorp's open during
the day, so we can't go during the day.
那麼我們現在去
But if you want to,
we can do it right now.
- Now? Right now?
- Tonight. Right now,
on the way to Lester's .
現在？你指這時候
現在就去
I'll meet you on the side of the road
by the New Jersey Turnpike.
我在紐澤西公路收費站旁等你
我有點怕
I'm scared.
You don't have to do this, you know.
那就別做

不，現在就回去
- No! I gotta go back now!
- We'll talk about it later.

Wow!
哇！
Being inside did something to me.
進入別人體內的感覺真奇妙
I knew who I was.
我知道自己是誰
It's like everything made sense.
I-I knew who I was.
心裡頭明白每樣事
但你不是你自己，而是約翰
But you weren't you.
You were John Malkovich.
天啊！我曾經是他，對不對
God, I was.
I was, wasn't I ?
我曾是…
I was--
我曾是約翰
I was John Malkovich.
I was--
I was John fucking Malkovich!

- We're late for Lester.
我還要進去

So tell me, Lotte,

Oh, yes, Dr. Lester.
Absolutely.

你在解釋營養的價值
You were just explaining
the nutritional value...
of ingesting minerals
through a colloidal form which
I couldn't agree more with.
以膠質的形態來攝取礦物質
這點我非常同意
Oh! Be still, my heart.

me in the direction of the restroom?
萊斯特博士，廁所在哪兒

為什麼你這麼問？
I bet Lester's not even aware of it--
him-- the portal. Why?
No reason.
I was just thinking.
沒什麼，我在想
Do you think that it's kind of weird
that John Malkovich has a portal?
為什麼約翰會有入口
背後會不會存在更重大的秘密
Do you think that it might have
some sort of significance, for example?
I don't know.
Why do you think that?

我所認知的世界上
有兩種人
is, I think the world is divided...
into those who go after what they want
and then those who don't , right?
一種是追求他想要的
另一種則完全相反
對不對？
- Right.
- The passionate ones--
熱情的人
喜歡追求他想要的…
the ones who go after
what they want--
或許得不到
well, they may not get
what they want.
[ Laughing ]
But-- But...
但…但是…
at least they remain vital.
至少他充滿活力
- Yeah.
- [ Craig ] Yeah.
所以在將死之際沒什麼遺憾
So when they lie on their death beds,
they have, um... few regrets.
Right?
對不對？
[ Spits, Laughs ]
And the ones who don't go
after what they want...
至於那些不去追求他想要的人
誰管他們
well... who gives a shit
about them, anyway?
- God! Craig!
- Lotte!
天啊！洛蒂！克雷
你並不吸引我
I don't find you attractive, hm?
And, Lotte...
I'm smitten with you.
但是洛蒂，當你在約翰體內時
[ Chuckles ] I am,
but only when you're in Malkovich.
卻深深使我迷失
When I looked into his eyes last night,
I could feel you peering out.
當我注視他眼睛時
可以感覺到你的存在
- Really?
- Yeah.
真的？
Behind the stubble and the too prominent
brow and the male-pattern baldness...
在那短髮濃眉及
充滿男性魅力的禿頭之後
I sensed your feminine longing.
我可以感受到
你女性溫柔的熱情
- And it just slew me. [ Laughs ]
- [ Laughs ]
就是這種感覺殺死了我
Oh, my God!
喔！我的天
Oh!
對不起，親愛的
只有當你在約翰體內才行
Only as John, sweetie.
Sorry.
Hey, thanks for
a wonderful dinner.

能不能打電話給他

Um... when?
什麼時候
Mm... tonight...

小牛仔，你遲到了
You are late, my little cowboy.
你是故意折磨我嗎
Are you torturing me on purpose?
我已墜入愛河
- I've fallen in love.
- I don't think so.
不可能
You know why?
Because I've fallen in love!
要知道原因嗎？
因為我已墜入愛河
墜入愛河的人就是這樣子
And this is what people
who have fallen in love look like.
你不需要這樣折磨自己
Well, you picked the unrequited variety.
It's very bad for the skin.
對皮膚很不好
瑪馨，你太邪惡
You're evil, Maxine.
你能想像兩個人同時
看著你的感覺有多奇妙嗎
Do you have any idea what it's like
to have two people look at you...
同一雙眼中同時流露出…
with total lust and devotion...
慾望和熱情

Wow.
No, I don't suppose you would.

- Oh, Maxine. Oh--
喔！瑪馨
喔！不

Something was making me talk.
奇怪的話，做奇怪的動作
Some goddamn thing
was making me move.
我要離開這裡
- I've gotta get out of here.
- Oh, doll face!
啊！寶貝
你只不過是因情慾
薰昏了頭罷了
It was just, uh,
your passion for me taking hold.
不，寶貝，我知道什麼是情慾
No, doll face. I know what
my passion taking hold feels like.
再見
Bye!
我成功了
I did it!
我支使他去撫摸

I made him move his arms

喔！還有…
Oh, and...
讓他講我要講的話
I made him talk sort of.

老友，對不起…
No, man, I'm sorry to--
這麼匆忙找你來
但是我真的非常害怕
I'm sorry to have called you like that,
but I was just really, really scared.
我被嚇呆了，就像…
I was so freaked out.
I mean, it was like... somebody was
just moving all the way through me...
有人控制我…
移動我的手臂和手
甚至替我講話
moving my arms, moving my hands,
talking for me.
查理，我真認為我瘋了
I mean, literally,
I feel like I'm going crazy, Charlie.
你沒瘋
- I'm sure you're not going crazy.
- You don't understand, man.
你不瞭解，我從來
沒有這種感覺
- It was like nothing
I've ever felt before.
- Yeah, yada, yada, yada.
你嗑藥了嗎
- Were you stoned?
- Yes. Yes, I was--
是，我是…
老天爺
Jesus.
是的，我是嗑了藥
Yes! Yes, I was stoned.
但…這與那無關
But what-- That doesn't have
anything to do with it.
查理，有人用我的嘴講話
Charlie, someone was talking
through my mouth.
你神智不清，結案
就這麼簡單
You were stoned.
Case closed. End of story.
這個女人有多熱情
- How hot is this babe?
- You know what?
也許是洛蒂在講話…
Maybe it was this
Lotte woman talking...
她有可能利用我來講話
because it could have been her
talking through me.
因為瑪馨喜歡叫我洛蒂
Because this--
the weird thing is...
this Maxine likes
to call me Lotte.
哎呀！有夠辣
Ouch. That is hot.
也許她叫死去的
同性戀人上你身
Maybe she's using you
to channel some dead, lesbian lover.
我最喜歡這種女人
玩完後告訴我一聲
Sounds like my kind of gal. Let me know
when you're done with her, yeah?
玩完後，你是什麼意思
今晚差點把我嚇死
What are you talking about? Done with
her, man? Tonight really freaked me out.
你怎能讓女人叫你洛蒂
真是個傻瓜
You're nuts to let a girl go
that calls you Lotte.
I'll tell you that as a friend.
查理，我對這女人
一點也不瞭解
Charlie, I don't know
anything about the girl.
她說不定是女巫一類
- She could be, like,
a fucking witch or something.
- That's even better!
那更好
熱情再加上同性戀的女巫
到哪裡去找
Hot, lesbian witches.
Think about it. It's fucking genius.
我一定要找出真相
I gotta know the truth, Charlie.
只有蠢人才找真相
The truth is for suckers,Johnny boy.

我叫克雷蕭瓦
我們的業務是模擬試驗
and we operate

給我們的客人一個機會
that simulates, for our clientele,
well, the--
去體驗…
the experience of--
你的真實生活
of-- of being you, actually.
模擬試驗？
- Simulates?
- Yeah, after a fashion.
是的，現在正流行
到底是什麼意思？
- What exactly does that mean?
- Well, it's hard to describe.
很難描述
我想試試看
- I want to do it then.
- That would pale in comparison
to the actual experience.
這與真實根本無法比較
我要試試看
- I want to do it!
- Right now Mr. Hiroshi's in the tube--
現在哈許先生在隧道裡…

我知道，對不起
這是我的光榮
It's such an honor.
我曾到過邪惡的那一面
見過沒人見過的東西
I have been to the dark side. I have
seen a world that no man should see!
是嗎？對一般人來講
卻是個不錯的經驗
Really? For most people,
it's a rather pleasant experience.
看在老天的份上
我的入口，應該永遠封死
That portal is mine,
and it must be sealed forever...
for the love of God.
但是麥可維奇先生…
But, Mr. Malkovich, sir,
with all due respect...
是我發現的
I discovered that portal.
我靠它為生，你能瞭解嗎
- It's my livelihood. Do you understand?
- It's my head, Schwartz!
蕭瓦先生，但這是我的腦袋…
It's my head!
我們法院見
I will see you in court!

你一見到瑪馨就忘掉我
Well, you gave up that claim...
after the first time
you stuck your dick in Maxine, Lotte.
是你先愛上她的
You fell in love
with her first, Craig.
為了尊重我們的婚姻
我並沒做什麼
Yeah, but I didn't do anything about it,
out of respect for our marriage.
克雷，你之所以沒做什麼…
You didn't do anything
about it, Craig...
是因為她不給你機會
out of respect for the fact
that she wouldn't let you
near her with a ten-foot pole!
那是真的
That's true.
天啊！我變成了什麼

來我家有什麼事
what is it that brings you to my doorway

萊斯特博士
Well, Dr. Lester...
我…
see, I, uh--
我對約翰有一種
很不正常的念頭
I have a very unhealthy obsession
with John Malkovich.
是嗎？
I see.
你是指那個演員嗎？
You mean, the performer.
是的
Yes.
為什麼你會想來找我呢
And what prompted you
to come to me with this issue?
因為上次和我先生來吃飯時…
Well, when I was here
with my husband for dinner...
發現一間房間
有點像是約翰的博物館
I came upon a room that seemed to be
some sort ofJohn Malkovich museum.
所以我想你可能
So I thought perhaps
maybe you would...

have some appreciation
for my state of mind.
你穿著我的大浴袍
You look so lovely, my dear...

in my oversized man's robe.
謝謝你，萊斯特博士
Thank you, Dr. Lester.
告訴我
Tell me...
這個約翰所散發的是什麼魔力
what is this strange power
that Malkovich exudes?
你一定得幫我
因為我滿腦子想變成他
You've gotta help me understand because
all I think about is wanting to be him.
想什麼
- Wanting to what?
- Wanting to be him.
變成他
變成約翰麥可維奇
Wanting to be John Malkovich.
喔！原來是這樣
Oh, I see.
也許你能夠
Well, perhaps you can.
But, Dr. Lester--
但是萊斯特博士…

I am Captain Mertin.
我不懂
I don't understand.
九十年前，我發現
一個奇怪的入口
It was 90 years ago
that I discovered a strange portal.
它能領導我進入別人體內
And--And I found that
this portal led to a vessel body...
就這樣一個換一個
使我長命百歲
and that I could live forever
by leaping from vessel to vessel.
所以萊斯特就是你寄生的人體
- So Dr. Lester is such a vessel?
- Yes, he is.
不錯
甜心，你還在嗎
You still there, sweets?
Hmm.
我找到能夠久留的方法了
Ifigured out how to hang on
as long as I want.
秘密是和約翰的身體做朋友
It's all a matter of making friends
with the Malkovich body.
心想我真想穿這套
又好又昂貴的西裝
Rather than thinking of it
as an enemy that has to be
pounded into submission...
而不是想成
我要攻佔敵人的領土
I've begun imagining it
as a really expensive suit...
that I enjoy wearing.
[ Kissing Continues ]
Ah, this illustrates...
這說明了我如何
在約翰四十四歲生日時
how I will move into
my next vessel, Malkovich...
進入他的身體
on his 4 4th birthday.
那是他成熟的時候
That's when he becomes ripe.
那天午夜以前必須進入
But I must enter
by midnight on that day.
否則我會進入嬰兒體內
After that, I'd get diverted into
the next newly forming infant vessel.
那就不好了
I don't want that to happen.
因為我會被吸收
- I'd be absorbed.
- Absorbed? What does that mean?
吸收？什麼意思
像囚犯一樣被關在他腦裡
Well, uh, trapped, held prisoner,
if you like, in the host's brain...
沒法控制
unable to control anything...
注定永遠從他人眼裡看世界
forever doomed to watch the world
through someone else's eyes.
我介紹一些朋友給你認識
Now I'd like you
to meet some friends.
一個人太寂寞…
See, I got lonely
in Lester by myself...
所以這次帶些朋友去
so I figured out a way this time
to take others along with me.
來
Come.
[ People Chattering ]
各位，這是洛蒂
Everyone, this is Lotte.
嗨！洛蒂
- Hi, Lotte!
- She's a new friend of mine.
她是我的新朋友
克雷甜心，為我
表演一場木偶秀
Do a puppet show for me, Craig, honey.
用約翰的身體來表演
You mean, with Malkovich?
你在工作時最能使我興奮
- I'd love to see your work.
- Really?
當真？
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah?
Okay.
我稱之為…
This is something
that I call...
「克雷的絕望與覺醒」
"Craig's Dance of Despair
and Disillusionment."
�ҡ� [ Stereo: Orchestra ]
�ҡ� [ Continues ]
�ҡ� [ Ends ]
太棒了！你真行
That was incredible!
You're-- You're brilliant!
我不只在操縱木偶
You see, Maxine,
it isn't just playing with dolls.
天啊！
Oh, my darling,
it's so much more!
你在操縱一個活生生的人
It's playing with people.
[ Chuckles, Moans ]
永遠留在他體內
Stay in him forever.
[ Gurgling, Grunting ]
我要如何謀生呢
My darling, how will we make
a living if our clientele
doesn't have access to our product?
我們可以支用約翰的存款
Well, we'll have all the money
in Malkovich's bank account...
加上他仍有戲約進來
plus he does get
acting work occasionally.
別這樣
[ Grunting ]
No, please!
閉嘴！我們正在討論
- Shut up! We're trying to think here.
- Gee!
這有點像操縱木偶一樣
It is--
It is sort of like puppeteering.
很吸引人
- I-I-I like that about it.
- Exactly!
不錯
沒人知道真相
And no one would ever even
have to know it's not him.
我可以用他現有的聲名
And I could use
Malkovich's existing notoriety...
來創造我的木偶事業
to launch my own puppeteering career.
哦！克雷，你真是天才
Oh, Craigy.
Craigy, that's brilliant.
Oh. Oh.
我一直在想做為一個男人
有什麼感覺
So lovely. I've always wondered
what it would be like to have a penis.
我一直在想做為一個男人
有什麼感覺
So lovely. I've always wondered
what it would be like to have a penis.
現在我可以親身體會到
我知道…
- Now I'll know.
- [ Lotte ] Really? I know it's very--
洛蒂
Lotte?
We like you.
我們喜歡你
我們看得出你是一個高尚的人
We can see you're a kind
and decent woman...
如果你願意
and so...
我們同意在約翰身體內
也給你一個位子
we've decided to offer you
a place in John Malkovich with us...
if you like.
萊斯特博士
Dr. Lester...
謝謝你對我這麼信任
you've been so kind to me...
and trusting.
關於約翰…
And...
有件事必須要告訴你
there's just something I think you
should know about the Malkovich vessel.
約翰找你，可以讓他進來嗎
[ Woman On Speaker ] John's here
to see you. Should I send him in?
快請他進來，下次別叫他等
你懂嗎？
Of course send him right in. Don't ever
keep him waiting again, you understand?
- [ Angry Muttering ]
- [ Door Opens ]
[ Clears Throat ]
Hey,John.
什麼風把你吹來
櫃檯小姐的事請多原諒
Great to see you.
Sorry about the cunt at reception.
這是我的未婚妻，瑪馨
- This is my fianc��e, Maxine.
- Oh, great to see you, Maxine.
很榮幸見到你
櫃檯小姐的事請多原諒
請坐
Sorry about the cunt at reception.
Please, have a seat.
Can I get you anything?
Coffee? Water?
要不要喝點咖啡，還是水
不用了
No, thank you.
泰麗莎給我一杯雞湯
- Teresa, get me chicken soup.
- Okay.
好
雞湯？要來點雞湯嗎
Chicken soup?
Chicken soup?
賴瑞，我們馬上進入主題
Larry? Uh...
I want to get right to the point.
從現在開始，我不做演員
而要開始木偶事業
From now on, I'm no longer an actor.
I'm a puppeteer.
很好
Okay. Great.
我要重新出發
And I would like
to redirect my career...
從今以後約翰麥可維奇
與木偶畫上等號
so that from now on
the name John Malkovich...
will be synonymous with puppets.
Sure. Sure.
No problemo.
沒問題，你現在是木偶操縱者
Poof, you're a puppeteer.
J ust let me make a couple calls.
我會打幾通電話安排一切
[ Laughing Continues ]
「八個月後」
親愛的？
Honey? Maxine?
瑪馨
瑪馨
Maxine?
我在忙
I'm busy.
瑪馨甜心，開始了
Maxine, honey, it's on!
�ҡ� [ Dramatic ]
「絕望與覺醒之舞」
有真理也有謊言
Yeah, there's the truth,
and there are lies...
即使在撒謊的情況下
藝術永遠表現出真理
and, uh, art always tells the truth,
even when it's lying.
約翰這個謎樣的人物
[ Male Narrator ]
The enigmatic John Malkovich...
世界上最偉大的藝人
one of the world's greatest entertainers
and the man who reinvented...
領導我們進入木偶的全新領域
how we view puppeteering.
今晚我們要介紹
這位木偶的操縱者
Tonight we look at the man
above the strings...
以及他背後的女人
and the woman behind the man.
生長於伊利諾州的艾文鎮
Raised in Evanston, Illinois,
Malkovich had a lifelong interest
in theater arts...
他對劇院藝術有著深厚的興趣
也是芝加哥聞名世界的
史坦弗劇院公司
and as a young man was
one of the founding members...
of Chicago's world-renowned
Steppenwolf Theatre Company.
的年輕創始者之一
從此他平步青雲進入百佬匯
From there, it was a simple hop, skip
and a jump to Broadway accolades...
跟著在好萊塢佔下一席之地
and Hollywood stardom.
但沒有比他的下一步
更叫人驚訝
But nothing could prepare the public
for what was to come next.
「麥克的銀幕木偶」
短短的八個月前
And so it was that just
eight short months ago...
John Malkovich dropped the bombshell
that sent shock waves...
「永遠不再演出」
約翰投下一顆炸彈
震撼整個娛樂界
through the entertainment community.
放棄他的電影事業
而全部重新出發
Turning his back on his
former profession,
Malkovich had to start from scratch...
以初出茅廬的身份
進入操縱木偶的世界
and pay his dues all over again
as a fledgling puppeteer.
各位先生女士，我是約翰
「首次公開演出」
[ Clears Throat ] Hello, ladies
and gentlemen, I'm John Malkovich.
It's-- It's the-- I miss--
我是正牌約翰
I'm really John Malkovich.
[ Giggling ]
開始得非常辛苦
[ Narrator ]
From these inauspicious beginnings...
但他的成名卻又快又狂
John Malkovich's rise
to stardom was fast and furious.
今年的艾美獎是他的演藝高峰
His breakout performance occurred
at this year's Emmy Awards--
很不錯，我看起來
很棒，很性感
- [ Narration Continues ]
- It's really good!
I look really amazing.
I'd fuck me.
唯一使我感覺不安的是…
If there's anything
that upsets me about it...
如果我轉變得太快
it's feeling like
if I move into it too quickly...
我會被視為模仿者
「導演、演員：西恩潘」
I'll be, you know, deemed an imitator.
But, um, I think that once
we all get the courage...
等哪天我們像約翰一樣
有足夠的勇氣去跟著直覺走時
to just follow through on
our instincts, like Malkovich has...
許多人會進入木偶戲這個行業
I think that, uh, a lot of us
will move into puppetry.
約翰的成功
[ Narrator ] Malkovich's rise to fame
brought about a renaissance
in puppeteering.
造成木偶業的復甦
「高級木偶班」
不對，你在做什麼
「茱利亞學院」
No, no, no. What are you doing?
What are you doing?
你想表現什麼？
我想表現他的悲哀
- I'm making him weep,John.
- You're making him weep,
but you are not weeping.
但你自己並沒有先感到悲哀
一個木偶操縱者
本身絕不能成為旁觀者
Don't ever-- [ Beep ]
with your audience.
Until the-- the puppet becomes...
一定要與木偶
融成一體，這是嶄新的表演
an extension of you, it's a novelty act.
而不是那些華而不實的花招
It's , uh--
It's Topo Gigio.
絕不是
No?
他是工藝天才
[ Man ]
He's a technical genius.
他把物件加入生命
He breathes life
into inanimate objects.
這是非常莊嚴的事
It's a very godlike thing...
把生命注入其中
「洛杉磯時報，藝術評論家」
to be able to take something and,
you know, make it live.
他是大家談論的對象
[ Narrator ]
He was the talk of the town...
from the Beltway to Broadway...
他的太太及經理人瑪馨
扮演了很重要的角色
aided in no small part by
his new wife and manager, Maxine Lund.
經由瑪馨
他找到他的精神支柱
In Maxine,
Malkovich had found his mentor...
智慧以及靈感
his muse, his inspiration.
而約翰則是瑪馨的終生至愛
In Malkovich,
Maxine had found the love of her life.
- [ Panting ]
- There, there, my dear. Relax.
親愛的，放輕鬆
早上之前就會結束
This travesty will
all be over with by morning.
觀眾們都很熱情
「艾伯與海羅世界之旅」
And the crowds have been
absolutely sensational...
謝謝老天給我們這個機會
「倫敦首映」
and, um, I'd just like to thank God
for giving us this opportunity...
能和大家分享我們的創意
to share our creative vision.
早期任何困難阻止不了他們
[ Narrator ] Nothing was impossible
forJohn and Maxine in the early days.
他們是幸福的一對
一起不屈不撓的工作
Their union was a joyous one,
and together they worked tirelessly...
使約翰的木偶事業更進一步
to further Malkovich's
puppeteering career.
約翰是藝術家，瑪馨是企業家
「約翰傳記作者」
John Malkovich, the artist...
and Maxine, the entrepreneur--
他們一起創造了
they make this character...
約翰的特質及形象
this protean figure
that we call John Malkovich.
但有人說懷孕後瑪馨有所改變
[ Narrator ] But some say Maxine
has changed since becoming pregnant...
漸漸從舞台上淡出
recoiling from the limelight...
謠傳這是出自約翰的影響
and, rumor has it,
from her husband's affections.
我很抱歉
[ Whispering ]
I'm so sorry.
約翰讓我們看到
自己的本性缺失
[ Bing ] Malkovich shows us...
a reflection of ourselves,
our frailties...
以及人性的渴望
and our, you know,
desperate humanity.
也因此使他成為
這一代最偉大的藝術家
That's what makes him one of
the most relevant artists of our time.
至於約翰未來的走向呢
[ Narrator ] And what does the future
hold forJohn Horatio Malkovich?
套句巴德的話
「世界在他的掌控之下」
Well, to quote the Bard,
"He's got the world on a string. "
正如詩人所說…
As the poet said, " The puppeteer's voice
need not merely be the record of man.
「木偶的聲音就是
人類心靈深處的呼喚」
「也是他成功的支柱」
It can be one of the pillars,
the props...
to help him endure and prevail,��
and I believe that.
我非常同意這句話
播完了
It's over!
小瑪
Max?
我要去ABT劇院
I've gotta head down to A.B.T. now.
今晚義演天鵝湖
I've got the " Swan Lake"
benefit tonight, okay?
回來後我們可以慶祝
約翰四十四歲生日
But when I come back,
we can maybe celebrate...
Malkovich's big four-four.
好嗎？
Okay? Jesus!
為什麼找不到
進入年輕身體的入口
Why couldn't I have found
the portal to a younger body?

Hello? Hello?
瑪馨在我們這兒
- [ Lester ] We have Maxine.
- Oh! My God.
喔！天啊！別傷她
Please, please,
don't hurt her.
不管多少錢我都會付
Listen, I'll-- I'll give you
anything you want. Please.
你這個混蛋，我不要錢
You listen to me, asshole.
I don't want your fucking money.
我只要你離開約翰的身體
What I want is for you
to leave John Malkovich now!
誰？萊斯特嗎
- Who-- Who is this, Lester?
- Does it matter?
這有關係嗎？
如果你不馬上離開
我們就殺了瑪馨
We're gonna kill Maxine
if you don't leave the body immediately!
「生日快樂」
我不能
But I-I-I can't do that.
離開他，那我又成為克雷
I mean, if-if I leave Malkovich,
then I'm Craig Schwartz again.
沒事業、沒錢，瑪馨不會…
No career, no money.
Maxine will have nothing to do--
我們現在就已經貌合神離了
She barely has anything
to do with me now.
你這個瘋子
我們要殺死你太太
Jesus, we're going to kill your wife,
you fucking lunatic!
[ Moans ] God.
克雷，我們已經老了
而約翰是我們的通道
Listen, Schwartz,
Malkovich is our vessel. We're old.
我們會死的，如果在午夜…
We're going to die
if we don't get into him by midni--
[ Dial Tone Buzzing ]
他說我們在虛張聲勢
- He called our bluff.
- [ People Gasping ]
該死
Shit!
能不能進去把他擠出來
Can't we just go inside the portal
and push Craig out?
不，他力量太強
No, he's much too powerful.
他會把我們擠進約翰的潛意識
Schwartz would just jam us down
into Malkovich's subconscious.
洛蒂
Lotte.
如果我得不到你，沒人能
If I can't have you, no one will.
[ Gun Cocks ]
不，洛蒂
-[ Lester ] Lotte, no!
-[ Gunshot ]
不要，洛蒂
我們不能殺她
No, Lotte!
God, no, we can't really kill her!
她懷著約翰的孩子
是我們下一個通道
She's carrying Malkovich's seed!
Our next vessel!
[ Grunts, Shouts ]
嗨！救救我
Hey! Help me!
幫我
Help me!
該死！我在哪兒
- Where the fuck am I?
- We're in Malkovich's subconscious.
在約翰的潛意識裡
The last thing
you'll ever see, Maxine.
瑪馨，這是你葬身之地

It's your baby, okay?
What?
什麼？
這個小孩…是你的
The baby-- it's yours.
是我們的，當你在約翰體內時
我懷了這孩子
It's ours. I got pregnant
when you were in Malkovich.
別騙我
- You cannot fuck

- I'm not!
我沒有
留下他是因為
我知道你是父親…
I kept it because I knew
you were the father--
另一個媽媽
隨便啦！因為我…
the other mother--
whatever--
because I--
because it was yours.
因為是你的小孩
我們是他的父母親
