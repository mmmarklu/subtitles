
27
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:01,760
你好 朋友
Hello, friend.

28
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:04,990
"你好 朋友" 這么說太遜了
"Hello, friend." That's lame.

29
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:08,990
也許我應該給你取一個名字 但是這會讓我們陷入難以解釋的困境
Maybe I should give you a name, but that's a slippery slope.

30
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:11,990
你只存在于我的腦海中 我們必須得銘記這點
You're only in my head. We have to remember that.

31
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,720
媽的 這種事情真的發生了
Shit. It's actually happened,

32
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,990
我在和一個想象中的人交談
I'm talking to an imaginary person.

33
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:20,990
我要告訴你的是最高機密
What I'm about to tell you is top secret,

34
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:23,990
一個超乎我們所有人意想的陰謀
a conspiracy bigger than all of us.

35
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:25,990
在此之外 有一群極富權勢的人
There's a powerful groupof people out there

36
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:29,990
在秘密地操控著這個世界
that are secretly running the world.

37
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:31,990
沒有人知道他們我所說的這些人
I'm talking about the guys no one knows about,

38
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,990
這些家伙是無處可見的
the guys that are invisible.

39
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:36,990
他們是頂尖的那1%人中的1%
The top 1% of the top 1%,

40
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:41,610
不需要誰允許 他們就能扮演上帝
the guys that play God without permission.

41
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,420
而現在我覺得他們在跟蹤我
And now I think they're following me.

42
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:54,990
這些都和昨晚有關
This is about last night.

43
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,990
我本應該去安吉拉的生日派對
I should've gone to Angela's birthday party.

44
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:59,990
相反 我去了--
Instead, I went to--

45
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:08,990
嗨 羅恩
Hey, Ron.

46
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,990
給
There you go.

47
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:52,990
你是羅恩
You're Ron.

48
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:00,990
但是你的真名是羅希特 每塔
But your real name is Rohit Mehta.

49
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:01,990
你把它改成了羅恩 就在你六年前
You changed it to Ron when you bought

50
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:05,990
買下你的第一家羅恩的咖啡店的時候
your first Ron's Coffee Shop six years ago.

51
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:09,990
現在你有了17家分店 下一季度還會開8家新店
Now you got 17 of 'em,with 8 more coming next quarter.

52
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:14,000
我能幫你做些什么嗎?
May I help you with something?

53
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,990
我喜歡來這兒 因為你這兒的無線網很快
I like coming here 'cause your Wi-Fi was fast.

54
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:18,990
我的意思是 你這兒是為數不多的幾個
I mean, you're one of the few spots

55
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,990
用光纖連接 能達到千兆位速度的地方之一
that has a fiber connection with gigabit speed.

56
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:24,990
這很好 特別好 它觸動了
It's good. So good, it scratched

57
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:29,990
我心里的一部分 那一部分關于好的事情
that part of my mind, part that doesn't allow good to exist

58
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:32,990
不該無緣無故出現的想法 所以我開始攔截
without condition,so I started intercepting

59
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,990
你網絡中的所有通信量
all the traffic on your network.

60
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:37,990
這時候我注意到有些蹊蹺
That's when I noticed something strange.

61
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:41,990
也就是那個時候我決定黑了你
It's when I decided to hack you.

62
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:42,520
- 黑了--
- Hack--

63
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,900
我知道你在經營一個叫"柏拉圖的男孩"的網站
-I know you run a website called Plato's Boys.

64
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,140
不好意思?
- Pardon me?

65
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,650
你在用洋蔥路由網絡
You're using Tor networking

66
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:48,990
來使你的服務器保持匿名
to keep the servers anonymous.

67
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:51,180
你為了不讓別人看到 確實在這兒費了一番功夫
You made it really hard for anyone to see it,

68
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,500
但是我看到了
but I saw it.

69
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,620
洋蔥路由協定
The onion routing protocol,

70
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,990
并沒有你想象中的那么能隱姓埋名
it's not as anonymous  as you think it is.

71
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,990
不論是誰 只要被已存在的節點管理
Whoever's in control of the exit nodes

72
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:00,990
也會被網絡通信所掌握
is also in control of the traffic,

73
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:04,990
這也就讓我成為... 能夠掌控這些的人
which makes me... the one in control.

74
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,990
我必須禮貌地請你離開
I must ask you to kindly leave.

75
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:09,990
我掌握了一切
I own everything.

76
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:12,990
你所有的郵件 你所有的文檔
All your emails. All your files.

77
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,990
你所有的...圖片
All your...pics.

78
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:20,990
馬上從這兒滾出去 否則我要叫...
Get out of here right now, or I'll call the--

79
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:22,990
警察? 你希望他們發現
Police? You want them to find out

80
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:24,990
你提供給你的40萬用戶的那些超過
about the 100 terabytes of child pornography

81
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:27,990
100千兆字節的兒童色情片么?
you serve to your 400,000 users?

82
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:31,990
就我個人來說 哥們兒 我會希望這不過是些
Personally, man, I was hoping it was just gonna be

83
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:34,990
捆綁性虐一類的東西
some BDSM stuff.

84
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,990
你知道那樣 事情會簡單多少么?
You realize how much simpler that would have been?

85
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:44,990
我沒有傷害任何人
I did not hurt anyone.

86
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,990
我從沒傷害過
I never did.

87
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:54,990
那是我的... 個人生活
That's my... personal life.

88
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:02,990
我很理解和別人不一樣
I understand what it's like

89
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:05,990
是什么感覺
to be different.

90
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:09,990
我也很不一樣
I'm very different too.

91
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:14,990
我的意思是 我不會對著小孩手淫 只不過...
I mean, I don't jerk off to little kids, but...

92
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:18,990
我不懂得如何和人交流
I don't know how to talk to people.

93
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:21,990
我爸爸是我唯一能夠進行交流的人
My dad was the only one I could talk to.

94
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,990
但是他死了
But he died.

95
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:34,990
我很抱歉聽到這個消息
I'm sorry to hear that.

96
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,490
我能問問
How did he pass,

97
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:36,990
他是怎么死的么?
may I ask?

98
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,990
白血病
Leukemia.

99
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:43,560
他得病毫無疑問是因為他工作的
He definitely got it from radiation

100
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,700
公司里的那些輻射
at the company he worked at,

101
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,990
雖然我沒有辦法證明這一點
though I couldn't prove it.

102
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:49,990
現在他死了
Now he's dead.

103
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,000
不過公司還好好的
Company's fine, though.

104
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,990
哦... 嘿
Oh...hey.

105
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,990
沒關系 羅希特
It's okay, Rohit.

106
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:05,990
你不需要擔心了
You don't have to worry anymore.

107
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:07,990
我沒聽懂
I don't understand.

108
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:12,000
你是在敲詐我么?
Are you blackmailing me?

109
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,990
所以這一切都是關于...
So that's what this is about...

110
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:16,990
錢
money.

111
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:20,990
這就是你想要的 哈?
That's all you care about, huh?

112
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,990
不行
No.

113
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,990
如果我現在付錢給你 你就會越要越多
If I pay you now,you'll want more and more.

114
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:31,990
無論我給你多少
No matter how much I give.

115
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:34,990
你都會告訴警察的
You will inform the police anyway.

116
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:36,990
我不會付錢給你的 先生
I won't pay you, sir.

117
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,990
記住 你也違反了法律
Remember, you also broke the law.

118
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:44,990
事實上 你講對了
Actually, you're right.

119
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,000
只講對了一部分
Partly.

120
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,700
是這樣 我通常是在我的電腦上
See, I usually do this kind of thing

121
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:50,990
做這些事情
from my computer,

122
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,990
但是這次我想脫離電腦來做
but this time I wanted to do it  AFK.

123
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,990
親自當面做
In person.

124
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,990
努力來克服我的社交焦慮
Trying to work on my social anxiety.

125
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,420
不過在我把你叫出來以后 總是會有
But there's always the threat of you fleeing

126
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,860
你會逃跑的威脅存在
after I call you out.

127
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,680
你會告訴你的系統管理員
You'd tell your sys admin

128
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,400
關閉你的服務器 抹掉所有數據
to take your servers down,wipe all the data.

129
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,990
所以我保證
So I made sure to include

130
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:11,140
我的匿名舉報中 會包含現在的時間
the current time and location

131
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,990
還有地點
on my anonymous tip.

132
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:13,990
等一下 別走
Wait. Hold on.

133
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:14,810
我給你錢
I'll give you the money.

134
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:15,980
我付你錢
I'll pay you.

135
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:15,990
你想要多少?
How much do you want?
我付你錢
I'll pay you.

136
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:16,620
你想要多少?
How much do you want?

137
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,990
我都會給你
I'll pay you.

138
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,090
這就是你想錯的那部分 羅希特
That's the part you were wrong about, Rohit.

139
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:24,990
我才不在乎什么鳥錢
I don't give a shit about money.

140
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:33,310
機器人先生

141
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:33,310
第一季  第一集

142
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,990
現在我被跟蹤了
Now I'm being followed.

143
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:47,450
高層的人不喜歡有我這樣能力的人
The higher ups don't like someone with my powers.

144
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:48,370
在短短的三分鐘里
In three short minutes,

145
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:51,140
我毀掉了一個男人的事業 生活和存在
I destroyed a man's business,life, existence.

146
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:52,850
我刪除了他
- I deleted him.

147
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:53,300
嘿!
- Hey!

148
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,970
嘿 你
Hey, you.

149
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:57,000
嘿 小孩兒
Hey, kiddo.

150
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,990
發生什么了?
What's happening?

151
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:07,990
現在正是這個世界上激動人心的時期
Exciting time in the world right now.

152
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,990
激動人心的時期
Exciting time.

153
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,730
可是我只是一個黑夜里維護秩序的黑客
But I'm only a vigilante hacker by night.

154
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:36,900
在白天 不過是一個普通的
By day, just a regular

155
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,440
網絡安全工程師
cyber security engineer,

156
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:42,990
員工編號 ER28-0652
employee number ER28-0652.

157
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,000
伊利艾特!
Elliot!

158
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,990
這兒
In here.

159
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:53,000
怎么了?
- What's up?

160
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,990
伊爾
- El.

161
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,100
好了 我完全能 我完全能搞定這個
Yeah, I can totally-- I can totally handle it.

162
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:04,940
他們又被黑了了
They were hacked again.

163
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:05,990
昨天晚上
Last night.

164
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,990
吉迪恩...
Gideon...

165
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:09,990
那個是我的發小安吉拉
That's my childhood friend Angela.

166
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,930
她有時候會神經兮兮的
She can be a bit high strung sometimes,

167
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,990
但是相信我 她是好人一個
but trust me-- she's one of the good ones.

168
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:14,990
我看的這是什么?
What am I looking at?

169
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:15,780
是訪客記錄文檔么?
Is this the log file?

170
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,990
這是一次RUDY攻擊
This was a RUDY attack.

171
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:19,570
真是太棒了
This is awesome.

172
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:21,170
吉迪恩 你能不能回答我?
- Gideon, will you answer me?

173
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:21,170
太棒了?
- Awesome?

174
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:23,220
你覺得這很棒? 這會弄死我們的 伊利艾特
You think this is awesome? This is killing us, Elliot.

175
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,260
- 吉迪恩 我不是 - 安吉拉!
- Gideon, I'm not-- - Angela!

176
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,990
我們還是看看今天這個會怎么開吧
Let's just see how this meeting goes today.

177
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,880
他們的網絡每周都會遭到攻擊
Their networks are getting attacked every week.

178
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,990
誰知道他們會不會愿意繼續做我們的顧客
Who knows if they'll still even be a client.

179
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,700
他們黑進來了? 嘿 我們是怎么說的
They're coming in? Hey, what did we say

180
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,990
員工著裝要求?
about the dress code?

181
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,320
好吧 現在看完那些記錄
All right, now,look over those logs.

182
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,990
然后下午要準備好以防他們有任何問題
And be ready this afternoon in case they have any questions.

183
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,990
好么?
Okay?

184
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:47,990
好的
Okay.

185
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,890
- 又開始抽煙了? - 你昨天晚上
- Start smoking again? - Did you not get

186
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:53,990
是不是沒收到我的短信?
my texts last night?

187
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,990
我實打實地給你發了13條
I sent you exactly 13 of them.

188
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:57,160
啊 我很抱歉
Yeah, I'm sorry.

189
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:57,990
我沒能去成
I couldn't make it.

190
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:02,970
你答應過我
You promised me that you were

191
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:03,840
你這次會試試的
gonna try this time.

192
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:20,460
當我和你說話的時候
Stop thinking about something else

193
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,990
不要想別的事情
when I'm talking to you.

194
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:24,330
我討厭你那么做
I hate when you do that.

195
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,990
對不起 我是在想工作的事情
Sorry. I was thinking about work.

196
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,990
也許這就是為什么吉迪恩這么愛你的原因吧
Maybe that's why Gideon oves you so much.

197
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,990
他一直感謝我引薦了你
He thanks me all the time for bringing you in.

198
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,990
但是不知道為什么
But for some reason,

199
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,990
我覺得你私下里很討厭這兒
I think you secretly hate it here.

200
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,810
她說對了
She was right.

201
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:37,840
我更喜歡這兒的人
I liked most of the people,

202
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,990
而不是我們保護大集團的
but our business, a cyber security firm

203
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:40,990
網絡安全公司的這份工作
that protects corporations--

204
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:43,990
我想不出比這更討厭的事情了
I can't think of anything I hate more.

205
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:44,990
不是啊 我喜歡這兒
No, I love it here.

206
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,990
不好意思
I'm sorry.

207
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:55,990
我只是心情不大好
I'm just in a bad mood.

208
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,530
我已經拖延支付了
I'm late on my last

209
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,990
最近的兩筆助學貸款還款
two student loan payments,

210
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,990
我也不能讓吉迪恩給我加薪
and I can't get Gideon to give me a raise.

211
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:05,990
呦 哥們兒
Yo, buddy.

212
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,920
昨晚上沒見你
Missed you last night.

213
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,320
你去哪了?
Where were you?

214
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:08,720
我走了
Gotta go.

215
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,990
今天的會很重要
Big meeting today.

216
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,990
你搞明白發生什么了嗎?
Did you find out what happened?

217
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,990
嗯 他說他在工作
Yeah. He said he was working.

218
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:18,210
哦 得了吧
Oh, come on.

219
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:18,990
你得和他談談
You gotta talk to him.

220
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:19,990
我們要在員工大會上遲到了
We're gonna be late for the staff meeting.

221
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:21,850
他根本就受不了我
He can't stand me.

222
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,410
而你知道為什么
And you know why.

223
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,990
安吉拉 我不能夠
Angela, I can't have

224
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,360
讓我的生活中有那樣的負能量
that kind of negativity in my life.

225
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:30,990
這才是我要說的
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

226
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:42,990
你在想什么啊?
What are you thinking about?

227
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:46,730
沒什么
Nothing.

228
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,990
你想知道 我在想什么嗎?
You want to know what I'm thinking about?

229
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:53,990
你第一次來找我的時候
First time you came to me.

230
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,990
準確說我并不是去找克里斯塔
I didn't exactly come to Krista.

231
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,440
我是被逼去的
I was forced here.

232
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,330
不過我的確喜歡她
But I do like her.

233
00:10:58,330 --> 00:10:59,990
黑她的電腦很容易
Hacking her was simple.

234
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:01,990
她的密碼是 Dylan 2791
Her password: Dylan 2791.

235
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,940
最欣賞的藝術家和
Favorite artist and the year in

236
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,990
她出生的年份倒過來
which she was born, backwards.

237
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:06,990
雖然她是個心理醫生
Though she's a psychologist,

238
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:08,770
但她讀人的能力
she's really bad

239
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:09,490
實在是差勁
at reading people.

240
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:10,990
不過我很擅長讀人
But I'm good at reading people.

241
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,280
我看得到
I look for

242
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,920
他們最糟糕的一面
the worst in them.

243
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:16,780
我知道她四年前
I know she went through

244
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,990
經歷了一次離婚
a divorce four years ago.

245
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:19,490
我知道她曾因此精神崩潰
I know she was devastated by it

246
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:20,620
還從那后在百合網上
and has been dating losers

247
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,990
和些窩囊廢約會
on eHarmony ever since.

248
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,410
她最近的囊中物是--
Her most recent foray--

249
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,990
邁克爾 漢森
Michael Hansen.

250
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,220
我在網上搜索了他 但是一無所獲
I searched for him online,but nothing came up.

251
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,990
沒有領英網資料 沒有臉書 干干凈凈
No LinkedIn, no Facebook,nothing.

252
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:34,990
他的一些事情困擾著我
Something about him bugs me,

253
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,990
又一次觸動了我心里的一部分
scratching that part  of my mind again.

254
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:39,340
但是我很快就能黑他了 我總能黑別人
But I'll hack him soon enough.I always do.

255
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,600
我知道你已經不像以前那樣大喊大叫了
I know you're not yelling like before,

256
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,720
這很好
which is good.

257
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,240
但是我能察覺到你還是不能釋懷
But I can tell you're still holding on to it.

258
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,680
我們需要解決你的暴躁易怒 伊利艾特
And we need to work on your anger issues, Elliot.

259
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,220
你對每個人 對社會都心懷憤恨...
You're angry at everyone, at society...

260
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,800
操你媽的社會
Fuck society.

261
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,700
我知道你有很多可憤怒的事情
I know you have a lot to be angry about,

262
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,620
但是要壓制在自己內心里 保持冷靜
but keeping it to yourself and staying quiet

263
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:00,320
像你現在這樣這樣是對你自己沒有幫助的
like you're doing--it's not going to help you.

264
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,040
在表象下的痛苦
There's pain underneath.

265
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,740
這才是我們需要解決的問題
That's where our work needs to go.

266
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:12,680
這個社會怎么讓你這么不滿呢?
What is it about society that disappoints you so much?

267
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,460
哦 我不知道
Oh, I don't know.

268
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:23,420
是因為我們都覺得史蒂夫 喬布斯
Is it that we collectively thought Steve Jobs

269
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,560
是個偉大的人 即使是我們都知道
was a great man, even when we knew

270
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,670
他的數十億資產是因為童工才得以成功?
he made billions off the backs of children?

271
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:33,580
或者是因為似乎我們所有的英雄偶像都是偽君子
Or maybe it's that it feels like all our heroesare counterfeit.

272
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:38,040
世界本身就是一個巨大的騙局
The world itself's just one big hoax.

273
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:41,740
發各種狗屁實況轉播的垃圾郵件
Spamming with our running commentary of bullshit

274
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:46,700
偽裝自己的內心 我們的社交媒體都在假裝親密
masquerading as insight, our social media faking as intimacy.

275
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:51,020
還是我們自己選擇了這些?
Or is it that we voted for this?

276
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:53,620
不是通過作弊選舉 而是通過我們自己的東西
Not with our rigged elections,but with our things,

277
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:55,740
自己的財產 自己的錢財
our property, our money.

278
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:56,980
我所講的都不是新聞
I'm not saying anything new.

279
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:58,720
我們都知道自己為什么這么做
We all know why we do this,

280
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,340
不是因為饑餓游戲的書籍讓我們覺得開心
not because Hunger Games books makes us happy

281
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,640
是因為我們想要沉著下來
but because we wanna be sedated.

282
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,680
因為這份苦痛不用假裝
Because it's painful not to pretend,

283
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,000
因為我們都是膽小鬼
because we're cowards.

284
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,380
操你媽的社會
Fuck society.

285
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,960
伊利艾特 伊利艾特
Elliot. Elliot.

286
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
你什么也不說
You're not saying anything.

287
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,840
這是怎么了?
What's wrong?

288
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,160
沒什么
Nothing.

289
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,990
別泄氣
Don't be frustrated.

290
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,990
我為什么不應該泄氣
Why shouldn't I be?

291
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:32,000
你和大多數人都不一樣
You're different than most.

292
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,780
至少你努力了
You at least try.

293
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,160
至少你懂得了
You at least understand.

294
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,880
懂什么了?
Understand what?

295
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,160
孤獨的滋味
What it's like to feel alone.

296
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,940
你懂得這種苦痛
You understand the pain.

297
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:51,360
你想要保護人們遠離苦痛
You want to protect people from it.

298
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,100
你想要保護我遠離苦痛
You want to protect me from it.

299
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:58,880
我敬重你這一點
I respect that about you.

300
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:06,140
你為什么覺得我懂得孤獨的滋味?
Why do you think I know what it's like to feel alone?

301
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,240
媽的! 從她的郵件知道的!
Shit! From her emails!

302
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,580
伊利艾特?
Elliot?

303
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,380
我也不知道
I don't know.

304
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,640
我們來說說昨天晚上
Let's talk about last night.

305
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,990
你去安吉拉的生日派對了嗎?
Did you go to Angela's birthday party?

306
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,940
去了 辦的不錯
Yeah. It was nice.

307
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:29,660
你有沒有試著和什么人講話?
Did you try to talk to anyone?

308
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,340
當然
Sure.

309
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,860
我要到了一個女孩的號碼
I got a girl's number.

310
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:35,540
你要到了號碼?
You did?

311
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,700
她很漂亮
She's cute.

312
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:40,990
她很喜歡饑餓游戲
She likes The Hunger Games.

313
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:47,240
你又在隱藏自己了 伊利艾特
You're hiding again, Elliot.

314
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:51,900
你隱藏自己的時候 你的錯覺就又出來了
When you hide, your delusions come back.

315
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:54,700
這是一種滑坡效應
It's a slippery slope.

316
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,990
我們來講講你一直能看到的那些黑衣人
Let's talk about the men in black you've been seeing.

317
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,240
他們還在那嗎?
Are they still there?

318
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:07,020
沒有了 我 告訴你他們都消失了
No, I... told you they're gone.

319
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,100
你給我的藥起作用了
The meds you gave me are working.

320
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,620
喲 老兄
Yo, man.

321
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,260
你想要 額...
Do you wanna, uh...

322
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,380
你想要今天一起吃午飯嗎?
you wanna do lunch today?

323
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,700
額 恩...
Uh, yeah...

324
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,160
-我有約了 -有約了 對啊
-I got other plans.-Other plans. Right.

325
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:28,220
前... 前三次我問你的時候你也是這么說的
That's...what you said the last three times I asked you.

326
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,360
聽著 老兄 你....
Look, bud, you...

327
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,620
和安吉拉一直以來都很親近
and Angela have been close

328
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:38,680
這是我想要和你搞好關系的更為重要的理由
for a long time, and that's even more reason why I want us to be on good terms.

329
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:42,180
我 我就是 就是覺得我們兩個之間有點尷尬
I-I just--I feel like things have been awkward between us.

330
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,660
你不覺得嗎?
Don't you?

331
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,800
我覺得我們兩個之間尷尬沒所謂
I'm okay with it being awkward between us.

332
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,980
額 好吧
Um, yeah.

333
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,220
我 我 我覺得這樣有所謂
I-I'm--I'm not okay with that.

334
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,000
額.. 聽著 老兄 我愛安吉拉
Um...look, man, I love Angela,

335
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:58,740
我想我們兩個看在她的份上好好相處
and I want us to-- to get along for her sake.

336
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,400
我的意思是 這是我 這是我此時此刻在這的原因
I mean, that's what I'm-- that's what I'm here for.

337
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,980
我就是 我通常不做這樣的...
I just, I... I don't normally do stuff...

338
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:06,620
我不喜歡這個人太神經質了嗎?
Am I crazy not to like this guy?

339
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,260
他的臉書點贊的有
Among some of his Facebook likes

340
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,260
喬治W布什的 決策時刻
are George W. Bush's Decision Points,

341
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,460
變形金剛2: 卷土重來
Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen,

342
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:15,120
喬詩葛洛班的音樂
and the music of Josh Groban.

343
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:17,880
我還要更進一步證明我的想法?
Must I really justify myself any further?

344
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,990
我還在攻克這些狗鋪 你知道嗎?
I'm working on that shit, you know?

345
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:25,990
他是最容易黑的人 密碼是123456七
His was the easiest to hack. Password was 123456Seven.

346
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:28,990
我見證了他通過微信對安吉拉說的第一句"我愛你"
I witnessed his first "I love you" With Angela over Gchat,

347
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,320
接著我又見證了第一次偷偷與史黛拉B出軌
then I witnessed the first of many infidelities with Stella B.

348
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:38,260
我從來沒有做過這樣的事...我想過要告訴安吉拉
I've never done anything like this before...I've thought about telling Angela,

349
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,580
但是她對男人的品位跟屎一樣
but she has shitty taste in men,

350
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:42,460
而且我也沒有準備好看看接下來會發生什么
and I'm not quite ready to see what comes after this just yet.

351
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,480
你喜歡音樂 我喜歡音樂
You like music. I like music.

352
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,740
魔力紅
Maroon 5.

353
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:48,480
而且奧利比起其他人更容易被我控制
Plus I can manage Ollie easier than the others.

354
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,820
不管怎么說 至少現在是這樣
for now, anyway.

355
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,480
我就是這個意思
And that's all I mean.

356
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,180
我就是想要你知道
I just want you to know that.

357
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,700
我喜歡你 兄弟 而且...
I like you, bro, and...

358
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,990
我也想要你喜歡我
I want you to like me too.

359
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,140
我理解
I understand.

360
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,990
我會更加努力的
I'll try harder.

361
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:03,780
沒關系的 老兄
That's cool, man.

362
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:07,500
嘿 不管你什么時候準備好了 我都愿意...
Hey, whenever you're ready, I'd love to just...

363
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,990
被你震一下
chill.

364
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:16,990
哦 忘了你 不愿意被人碰
Oh--forgot about your... no touching thing.

365
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,940
事實上 我不應該討厭奧利 他不是個很壞的人
Truth is, I shouldn't hate Ollie; he's not that bad a guy.

366
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,990
他太蠢不夠格當壞人
He's too dumb to be bad.

367
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
事實上 當我想到非常壞的人...
In fact, when I think about the really bad people...

368
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:35,320
E公司 世界上最大的綜合企業
E Corp, the largest conglomerate in the world...

369
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:36,200
企業之大
they're so big,

370
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,620
他們真的是無處不在
they're literally everywhere.

371
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:42,440
真是現代社會最完美的妖魔
A perfect monster of modern society.

372
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:47,520
-E可能是代表邪惡 -所有的生命所需
-The E might as well stand for Evil. -And all of life's necessities...

373
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,000
事實上 經過一番徹底的精密的自我編程
In fact, after a thorough,intensive self-reprogramming,

374
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,800
這就是我所聽到 看到 讀到的
that's all my mind hears, sees, or reads

375
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,540
-當他們突然出現在我的世界里 -這就是必須要提供的
-when they pop up in my world. -That was have to offer.

376
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,480
眾志成城 我們就能改變世界
Together, we can change the world,

377
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,560
E- 邪惡公司
with E-- Evil Corp.

378
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,500
如果克里斯塔知道我這么做肯定會被嚇得不輕
Krista would have a shit fit if she knew I did that.

379
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:06,360
但是這就是他們的本質 一家邪惡大企業
But that's what they are-- a conglomerate of evil.

380
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,920
現在我不得不幫助他們
And now I have to help them.

381
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,500
負責您公司的有6位在線工程師
There are six on-site engineers on your account.

382
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,660
- 加上幾位線下... - 就是他 泰利 科爾比  首席技術官
- Plus a few off-site...- There he is, Terry Colby,the CTO.

383
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:18,260
雖然他是世界上最大公司之一的技術人員頭目
Even though he's the head technology guy at one of the biggest companies in the world,

384
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,940
他還是用黑莓
he owns a Blackberry.

385
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:22,660
所以目前為止就是這樣
So this is it right here.

386
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,990
而且看起來好像他不經常用電腦
But also looks like he doesn't see a terminal very often

387
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:28,340
他不是個技術專家 他是個腦殘
He's not a techie. He's a moron.

388
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,780
一個傲慢的腦殘
An arrogant moron.

389
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,340
最差勁的那種
The worst kind.

390
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,540
哦 嗨 我是提瑞爾 威力克
Oh, hi. Tyrell Wellick.

391
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:42,990
我是科技部高級副總裁
I'm Senior Vice President, Technology.

392
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:47,220
伊利艾特 我就是個技術工
Elliot. Just a tech.

393
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:49,240
別這么謙虛
Don't be so humble.

394
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,000
要知道 我也是從你這個位子起家的
You know, I started out exactly where you are,

395
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,620
而且 實話說 你知道的 我的心還在這里呢
and...to be honest, you know,my heart is still there.

396
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,000
我看你在運行Gnome啊
So I see you're running Gnome.

397
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,340
你知道 我自己其實還在用KDE
You know, I'm actually on KDE myself.

398
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:04,500
我知道你的這個桌面環境應該更完善的 但是
I know this desktop environment is supposed to be better but...

399
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,680
你也知道他們怎么說
you know what they say.

400
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,860
舊習難改
Old habits-- they die hard.

401
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,990
一個行政人員運行Linux
An executive running Linux with--

402
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:12,740
恩 我知道你在想什么
Yeah, I know what you're thinking.

403
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,320
我是個行政人員 我是說
I'm an executive. I mean...

404
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:17,260
我為什么要運行Linux呢?
why am I even running Linux?

405
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:19,990
再說一遍 是因為舊習
Again--old habits.

406
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,000
和你一起工作肯定很有趣
It's gonna be fun working with you.

407
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:28,500
我該去找我的團隊了
I should join the rest of the group.

408
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,660
再見 伊利艾特
Bonsoir, Elliot.

409
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,990
有時候我夢想拯救世界
Sometimes I dream of saving the world.

410
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:46,540
拯救每個人逃脫無形的手
Saving everyone from the invisible hand,

411
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:49,990
那只用員工證歸類我們的手
one that brands us with an employee badge.

412
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:56,000
那只迫使我們為他們工作的手
The one that forces us to work for them...

413
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:01,260
那只每天控制著我們而我們卻不自知的手
The one that controls us every day without us knowing it.

414
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,500
但是我無法阻止它
But I can't stop it.

415
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,280
我并不那樣特殊
I'm not that special.

416
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,340
我只是個無名小卒
I'm just anonymous.

417
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,550
我踽踽獨行
I'm just alone.

418
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,060
如果不是為了庫爾提
If it weren't for Qwerty,

419
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,990
我會變得徹底空虛
I'd be completely empty.

420
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:30,740
我恨我難抑內心空虛的時候
I hate when I can't hold in my loneliness.

421
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,960
哭泣得太頻繁
This crying has been happening too often,

422
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,990
現在每隔一周發作一次
every other week now.

423
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,990
當正常的人這樣難過的時候都做什么?
What do normal people do when they get this sad?

424
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:46,990
他們聯系朋友或家人 我是這么覺得的
They reach out to friends or family, I think.

425
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:52,990
我沒有這種選擇
That's not an option.

426
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,340
我只能嗑嗎啡
I do morphine.

427
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:00,920
嗑嗎啡而又不會把自己變成癮君子的關鍵在于
The key to doing morphine without turning into a junkie

428
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:04,440
每天限食30毫克
is to limit yourself to 30 milligrams a day.

429
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,860
再多的吸食就會產生藥物耐受性
Anything more just builds up your tolerance.

430
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:11,380
我核查了每片藥的純度
I check every pill I get for purity.

431
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,760
我有8毫克的納洛酮以維持
I have 8 milligram Suboxone for maintenance

432
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,540
以防我退癮
in case I go through withdrawals.

433
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:19,990
媽的! 我又用完了
Shit! I'm out again.

434
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:23,500
多少錢？
How much?

435
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:26,210
我請了
On the house.

436
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:28,510
不 夏拉
No, Shayla.

437
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:29,830
別這樣
Not doing that.

438
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:31,030
好嗎? 這只是一個
Okay? This is just

439
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:32,360
普通的毒品交易
a regular drug deal

440
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:33,490
就像我們之前做的
like it always is.

441
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:34,710
好吧
Fine.

442
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,140
所以你今晚要做什么?
So what are you up to tonight?

443
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:36,950
我嘗試在
'Cause I tried to post

444
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:38,060
你的臉書上發點東西
something on your Facebook

445
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,490
但是我沒有找到你
and couldn't find you.

446
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,120
我沒有臉書賬號
I'm not on Facebook.

447
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:42,860
什么? 為啥?
What? Why not?

448
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,150
因為我討厭臉書
'Cause I hate Facebook.

449
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:49,460
這太不正常了
That's crazy.

450
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,970
那你今晚想不想
Well...you want to

451
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:54,360
一起吸點這個?
do these together then?

452
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,780
純搖頭丸哦...
Pure Molly...

453
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:13,250
永遠不要在你嗑藥之后做決定
Don't ever make decisions when you're on morphine.

454
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:25,570
Instagram上顯示克里斯塔
Instagram check-in

455
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:27,410
去了綠蒂酒吧
for Krista at Pierre Loti.

456
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,150
好的 邁克爾 漢森
Okay, Michael Hansen.

457
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,020
是時候該查明你到底是誰了
Time to find out who you really are.

458
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:20,370
謝謝你 再見
Thank you. Bye.

459
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:24,900
出租車!
Taxi!

460
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:32,170
喂 你好 我剛剛把
Uh, hi--I just left

461
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,530
我的鑰匙落在你們的出租車上了
my keys in one of your cabs.

462
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:36,460
56Y2
56Y2.

463
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,620
好的
Sure.

464
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:44,070
你們兩個怎么說?
What about you two?

465
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,150
你們有沒有
You guys got any

466
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:47,490
多余的零錢?
spare change?

467
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,850
來幫我解決溫飽問題？
Help me out?

468
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,330
紐約人都很有錢的 朋友們
New York's expensive, guys.

469
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,270
施舍一點吧
Come on.

470
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:55,030
霍桑街306號
306 Hawthorne.

471
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,990
謝謝你 非常感謝你
Thank you.Thank you.

472
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,950
快點 笨蛋
Come on, asshole

473
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,010
已經噓噓過了
Piss already.

474
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,210
快點
Come on!

475
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:22,780
快點啊你
Come on!

476
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:23,890
你...你不想走嗎？
Will you--will you go?

477
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:26,710
快點 我們走啊 走 你不是要走嗎？
Come on, go, go! Go, will ya?

478
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:27,710
嘿
Hey.

479
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,340
我可以借一下你的手機嗎?
May I borrow your phone?

480
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:34,120
我的沒電了
Mine's dead.

481
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,050
我需要給我媽媽打個電話
I need to call my mom.

482
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,770
謝謝你了
Thank you.

483
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:05,350
沒人接
No answer.

484
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:06,790
還是謝謝你了
Thanks anyway.

485
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:25,290
安吉拉 有事嗎?
Angela,is everything okay?

486
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:27,450
我需要你來公司一下
I need you to come to AllSafe.

487
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,260
你在那?
You're there?

488
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:30,250
現在可是凌晨三點
It's 3:00 in the morning.

489
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:31,550
他們又一次攻擊了邪惡公司
They attacked Evil Corp

490
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:32,380
的服務器
servers again,

491
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:33,320
這次要嚴重的多
but it's bad this time.

492
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,080
這次是分布式拒絕服務攻擊
It's a DDoS attack.

493
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:36,850
你給羅伊德打電話了嗎? 現在該他值班
Did you call Lloyd? He's on call.

494
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:38,260
對 他現在在這里
Yeah, he's here.

495
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:40,270
他跟公司的技術部門聯系過了嗎?
Is he talking to their tech department?

496
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,400
他現在在跟他們線上交流
He's online with them,

497
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,480
但是目前一無所獲
but so far nothing.

498
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,550
我不覺得
I don't think that

499
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:46,870
羅伊德能夠解決這個問題
Lloyd can handle this.

500
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,040
聽著 吉迪恩剛剛把我調到這里來
Look, Gideon just put me on this account.

501
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:51,010
我不能才工作一周
I can't screw up

502
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:51,740
就把事情搞砸了
in my first week.

503
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,710
我需要你
I need you.

504
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:54,150
拜托了
Please.

505
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:06,520
防火墻進入受阻可能的分布式拒絕服務攻擊[拒絕連接]

506
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,950
我馬上過去
I'll be right there.

507
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:09,700
終于來了
Finally!

508
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,340
冷靜 這才一個小時
Calm down it's only been an hour.

509
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:15,990
當然 一個小時對邪惡公司來說可是大約1300萬美元的收入
Yeah, well, an hour in Evil Corp time is like $13 million in revenue, approximately.

510
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:16,860
實際上
Actually,

511
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:17,800
我計算過了
I calculated that.

512
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,850
這就是他們損失的錢數
That's exactly how much they lost.

513
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:20,980
不要擔心
Don't worry.

514
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:22,410
我來幫你了
I got you.

515
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,200
羅伊德 怎么樣了?
Lloyd, what's up?

516
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:25,930
羅伊德!
Lloyd!

517
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:29,410
伊利艾特 情況很糟糕
Elliot. This is bad.

518
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,010
這是我見過的最棘手的分布式拒絕服務攻擊
Worst DDoS attack I've ever seen.

519
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,740
你能夠重新辨別域名嗎?
Did you reconfigure the DNS?

520
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:33,890
可以
Yes!

521
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:34,860
終止服務
Stop the services.

522
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:36,990
我已經終止了所有的服務 現在在嘗試重啟服務器
I already stopped the services, tries to reboot the servers

523
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:38,480
但是現在不能夠啟動服務器了
but they're not coming back up.

524
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,990
伙計 現在有人正在著手攻擊他們的整個網絡 就在現在
Dude, someone is straight up fingerblasting their entire network right now.

525
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:01,430
已經有相關報道了
They just started reporting on the outage.

526
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:05,580
有消息稱公司網絡服務器遭黑客攻擊比之前預估嚴重

527
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:10,450
該死 這比我想的還要糟
Shit. This is worse than I thought.

528
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,770
他們現在在網上?
They're in the network?

529
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,050
現在是什么情況?
What's the status update?

530
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:16,110
我以為我們有設置網絡安全協議呢
I thought we set up security protocols

531
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:18,650
所以這個不會發生
so that this doesn't happen.

532
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:20,750
這個攻擊源自哪里?
Where's the attack coming from?

533
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:21,950
很顯然 是從各個地方
Everywhere, obviously.

534
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,510
美國 芬蘭 泰國 科威特
The USA, Finland, Thailand, Kuwait--

535
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:27,390
開始重啟所有的服務器 開始共享 重定所有的數據流量 叫Prolexic幫忙
Start restarting the services, load sharing, redirect the traffic. Call Prolexic for help.

536
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:27,390
Prolexic是一家美國的云安全解決方案提供商 現被Akamai收購

537
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:29,040
怎么了?
What?

538
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:31,520
我不覺得這只是一次分布式拒絕服務攻擊那么簡單
I don't think this is just a DDoS attack.

539
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:36,560
我覺得他們已經獲得了一個隱匿程式 現在已經侵入到了整個服務器中了
I think they got a rootkit sitting inside the servers.

540
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,870
什么是隱匿程式?
What's a rootkit?

541
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,800
它就像是一個有著大屌的瘋狂強奸慣犯
It's like a crazy serial rapist with a very big dick.

542
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,350
上帝啊 羅伊德
Jesus, Lloyd.

543
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:45,250
對不起 就是能使系統徹底癱瘓的惡意代碼
Sorry. It's malicious code that completely takes over their system.

544
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,230
它能夠刪除系統文件
It can delete system files

545
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:48,330
終止所有的程序
and stop programs.

546
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:49,540
病毒 蠕蟲病毒
Viruses, worms

547
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,500
我們怎么才能阻止它?
How do we stop it?

548
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,310
這就是問題所在
That's the thing.

549
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:53,360
這個完全是隱形的 你無法阻止它
It's fundamentally invisible you can't stop it.

550
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,720
他們所有的服務器都已經超時了
All of their servers are timing out.

551
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,200
沒有辦法進行重啟
None of them are coming back up.

552
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:59,380
這是因為每次我們重新啟動服務器 病毒就會在這時候啟動
That's because every time we restart the server the virus replicates itself

553
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:01,990
加倍 從而破壞主機
during boot up and crashes the host.

554
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:05,990
所以我們怎樣才能救活整個網絡 如果我們不能重啟整個服務器?
How are we supposed to bring up the network if we can't restart the servers?

555
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,450
我們不能
We can't.

556
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:10,410
這就是他們想要的
Which is what they wanted.

557
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:14,990
通過保護自己 我們最后會將將病毒擴散到每個地方
By defending ourselves, we ended up spreading the virus everywhere.

558
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:18,990
我們能做的就是把整個系統斷開連接
Only thing we can do is we've gotta take the whole system offline

559
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:22,990
然后格式化被感染的服務器 清理干凈 然后再將其重啟備份
wipe the infected servers, clean, then bring them back up.

560
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,250
你跟我來
You're coming with me.

561
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:26,980
好
Yeah.

562
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:27,000
羅伊德
Lloyd.
好
Yeah.

563
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,030
羅伊德
Lloyd.

564
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,670
告訴所有人開始把所有的服務器斷開連接
Tell everybody to start taking everything offline.

565
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:31,030
在做了
On it.

566
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:34,820
服務器都在杜勒斯 我們需要一架飛機
Uh, the server farm in Dulles. We're gonna need the jet.

567
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,990
他們正在啟動服務器的備份
They're booting the network back up.

568
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,030
你現在開始下載所有的日志信息 對
Now, you're downloading the logs, right--

569
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,420
停 告訴他停下來
Stop. Tell him to stop.

570
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:54,840
怎么了?
What?

571
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:56,230
不要開始啟動序列
Don't start the boot sequence.

572
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,290
你們漏了一個
You guys missed one.

573
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:00,010
這里還有一個在運行的被感染的服務器
There's an infected server up and running.

574
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:03,510
在它攻擊這個服務器前我們還有多少時間?
What's the ETA before it hits this server?

575
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,470
備份服務器已經開始運行了?
The backup server up and running?

576
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:13,460
它準備好了 但是并沒有開始配置自動開關
It's ready, but it's not configured for auto switch.

577
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:21,420
我們需要重新定向所有的數據 然后改變域名
We need to redirect the traffic, need to switch DNS.

578
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:28,430
沒問題的 你搞定的 你能做到的
you got this. You got this, you got this,

579
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,910
這不現實啊
This is impossible.

580
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:33,200
能做到的 能做到的 你能做到的
you got this, you got this. You got this,

581
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,260
它馬上就到備份服務器了
It's almost at the back server!

582
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,500
我們還在線上?
We still up?

583
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:56,010
我們沒事了
We're okay.

584
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,200
是啊
Yeah.

585
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:07,860
漢克
Hank.

586
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:11,390
我現在要看一下受感染的服務器  給我點時間 行嗎?
I'm gonna take a look at the infected server, okay?  Give me a minute

587
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,710
恩 我在電梯里等著你
Yeah. Uh...I'll meet you at the elevators.

588
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,830
他們一定會留下一些痕跡
They must have left a mark or something.

589
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:24,800
每個黑客都渴望被關注
Every hacker loves attention.

590
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:27,230
他們才不會沒有原因的用分布式拒絕服務攻擊
They don't just do DDoS attacks for no reason.

591
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:35,080
這就是了
This is it.

592
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:36,600
F社會
Fsociety.

593
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,690
這難道是一個笑話?
Is that supposed to be a joke?

594
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:42,050
這實在是有點太簡單了 他們并沒有隱藏什么
This was way too easy. They didn't hide it well at all.

595
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:49,140
留著我

596
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:51,760
這是給我的
This note is for me.

597
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:55,590
他們在告訴我 讓我把它留下來
They're telling me to leave it here.

598
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:59,000
但是為什么? 這不重要
But why? Doesn't matter.

599
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,950
我們該關掉這些了
Time to shut them down.

600
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,430
為什么我不能刪除它?
Why can't I delete it?

601
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,310
我不想要去刪除它 我想要它呆在那里
I don't want to delete it. I want it to stay.

602
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:10,630
我這是怎么了?
What's wrong with me?

603
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:19,930
我將會重新配置根目錄的授權 這樣只有我才能使用
I'll reconfigure the access to the root directory so only I can use it.

604
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:24,960
沒人會知道
And no one will know.

605
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,290
給您的 先生
For you, sir.

606
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:37,650
你知道其實我是同性戀嗎?
Did you know that I'm gay?

607
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,480
不
No.

608
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:52,690
把這個當成是我對你出柜了 好吧?
Consider this me coming out to you then, okay?

609
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:56,030
這有點難 因為我不想談論我的性生活
It's hard because I don't like to talk about my sex life.

610
00:31:56,030 --> 00:32:00,000
但是我的伴侶 他疑心病很重
But my partner, he gets very paranoid.

611
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,820
他認為我對此感到羞恥
He thinks I'm ashamed of

612
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,580
他想讓我們的關系更加公開化
He wants me to be more public about it, so

613
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:08,770
不管怎么樣 我是同性戀
Anyway, I'm gay.

614
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:13,250
謝謝
Thanks.

615
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,970
嗯
Yeah.

616
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,180
嘿 先生 不要擔心了
Hey, man, don't worry about it.

617
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:27,990
黑客們很少集中注意力 他們很快就會無聊 然后就會騷擾別的人了
Hackers have a short attention span. They'll get bored, harass someone else.

618
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:31,990
邪惡公司正在考慮 跟我們分道揚鑣
Evil Corp is thinking about leaving us.

619
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:36,130
我都不知道該不該怪他們
And I don't know if I can blame them.

620
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:41,680
他們本可以找別的安全團隊的
They could have called their other security teams.

621
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:43,650
但他們找了你
They called you.

622
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:47,260
總會有那么些人喜歡我們
Well, somebody over there likes us

623
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,800
但是 泰利 科爾比 他現在壓力很大
but Terry Colby, he's getting the pressure.

624
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:52,910
是他提出要離開我們的
and he calls the shots.

625
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:56,770
邪惡公司整個我們生意的80%
Evil Corp is 80% of our business.

626
00:32:57,110 --> 00:33:01,990
如果我們失去了他們 將會是我們最大的損失 這將會是...
If we lose them, it's gonna be it for us.It's gonna be it...

627
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:04,990
我的損失
For me.

628
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:15,660
我覺得 我可以跟你講這些
NI feel like I can talk to you.

629
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,900
我的意思是 比跟別人講的更多
I mean, more than the others, anyway.

630
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:24,990
我確信 從某種程度上講 公司要是倒了 你會很高興的
I'm sure, in a weird way, you'll be happy if we went under.

631
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:27,920
別裝了
Oh, come on.

632
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:32,250
我知道你不喜歡 穿那些很蠢的襯衫
I know you hate wearing those stupid shirts.

633
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,970
吉迪恩?
Gideon?

634
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,160
我向你保證我會找到他們的
I promise I'll find them.

635
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,870
邪惡公司的服務器應該很快就會恢復
Evil Corp service should be back up soon enough.

636
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,400
我會看看那些數字文件
I'll take a look at the dat file.

637
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:09,380
等到家之后 我會問問互聯網聊天室的朋友關于F社會的事
I'll ask my IRC contacts about fsociety when I get home.

638
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:11,740
我永遠都看不到他們的名字 不會在明處看到
I've never seen their name on the boards though.

639
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:14,000
他們是新手 但是他們非常優秀
They've gotta be new, but they're good.

640
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:22,560
今夜過得很艱難吧?
Rough night?

641
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:27,270
機器人             先生

642
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,270
我要下車了
I'm getting off here.

643
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,880
我覺得你應該跟我一起走
I think you should come with me.

644
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,080
但前提是 你沒有刪除它
But only if you didn't delete it.

645
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:39,520
如果你刪了它 我們就沒啥可聊的了
You deleted it, we got nothing to talk about.

646
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:42,840
你在跟我說話?
Are you talking to me?

647
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:49,250
請遠離 正在關閉的門
Stand clear of the closing doors, please.

648
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:04,430
你是誰
Who are you?

649
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:07,910
我們在這里等Q號線
We gotta wait for the Q.

650
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,300
然后呢?
Then what?

651
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,260
然后我們去布魯克林
Then we're going to Brooklyn.

652
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:21,040
在科尼島附近
Out by Coney Island.

653
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:26,600
為什么? 那里有什么?
Why? What's there?

654
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:32,340
很明顯你會問一大堆問題
Obviously you're gonna ask a lot of questions.

655
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:36,240
你覺得自己在做的事兒 很奇葩 我懂
It's weird what you're doing right now, I get it.

656
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:41,880
我..我不能告訴你任何事 在我們到那兒之前
I-I can't tell you anything until we get there.

657
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:51,100
你不能在這兒抽煙
Can't smoke in here.

658
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:58,080
你一直在跟蹤我
You've been following me.

659
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:01,100
為什么?
Why?

660
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,200
你想從我身上得到什么?
What do you want from me?

661
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:12,640
我父親是個小偷
My dad was a petty thief.

662
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:16,140
從來不能老老實實的做一份工作 所以 他就搶劫
Never could hold down a job. So, he just robbed,

663
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:19,990
便利店啦 商店啦 小偷小摸的
convenience stores,shops,small-time stuff.

664
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:23,900
有一次他坐下來跟我說了一些話 是我終生難忘的
One time,he sat me down,he told me something I never forgot.

665
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:26,700
他說 "每個人都會偷東西
He said, "Everyone steals.

666
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,700
社會就是這么運作的
"That's how it works.

667
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:32,280
你覺得每個人都能得到他們應得的東西么?  不是的
"You think people out there are getting exactly What they deserve? No.

668
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:36,440
他們要么拿錢太多 要么太少
"They're getting paid over or under,

669
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,780
但是總有人遭到欺騙
but someone in the chain always gets bamboozled.

670
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:44,240
"我是偷東西 兒子 但是我沒有被抓 "
"I steal, Son,but I don't get caught."

671
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:47,380
那是我的社會契約
"That's my contract with society.

672
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:50,500
如果你能抓到我偷東西 那我就進監獄了
"Now if you can catch me stealing, I'll go to jail.

673
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,260
但是如果你不能
"But if you can't,

674
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:56,160
那我就賺到錢了"
then I've earned the money."

675
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:01,220
我很敬佩他所說的 兄弟
I respected that, man.

676
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:07,580
在我小時候我覺得那種事很酷
I thought that shit was cool as a little kid.

677
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,640
幾年之后
A few years after that,

678
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:12,660
他終于被抓了
they finally caught him.
幾年之后
A few years after that,

679
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:15,080
他終于被抓了
they finally caught him.

680
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:19,640
被送進了監獄并于五年之后逝世
Sent him to jail. Dies five years later.

681
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:22,760
我的崇敬也隨他而去
My respect goes with him.

682
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:27,080
我以為他在做自己的事的時候是自由的
I thought he was free doing what he did,

683
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,100
但事實并不是這樣的
but he wasn't.

684
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:33,100
他在監獄
He was in prison.

685
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:37,720
就像你現在一樣 伊利艾特
Just like you are now,Elliot.

686
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:43,600
但是我要把你救出來
But I'm gonna break you out.

687
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,640
你們為什么要碰面?
Why would you guys actually meet IRL?

688
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,780
你記得那個叫O-Megz的黑客團隊么?
You remember that hacker group O-Megz?

689
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:47,720
就是那個被自己的隊長舉報 導致6名黑客進監獄的那件事?
They got outed by their own leader to the FBI,and six hackers went to prison for it?

690
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,100
你知道他們怎么被抓的么?
You know how they got 'em?

691
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,500
警方黑進了一個成員的電腦
They went on the dude's computer,

692
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:54,180
通過郵件VPN對話 短信
tracked 'em all down through emails,VPN sessions,

693
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:56,160
將他們一網打盡
chat messages, texts.

694
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:00,010
- 就因為那一個人 所有的一切都泡湯了 這就叫 - 一顆老鼠屎壞了一鍋湯
- One guy, and the whole thing comes down. It's what's called - A central point of failure.

695
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:03,860
對 因為他們拒絕彼此親自見面
Right Because they refused to meet in person,

696
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:07,300
最終他們一次次發送的笑臉表情符號暴露了他們
they compromised each other every time they sent so much as a smiley face.

697
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,720
所以這里的規矩就是
The rule here is,

698
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:10,760
就在這兒做事
it's done here,

699
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,120
而且只在這兒做事
and only here.

700
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:17,990
一切終了于你走出這扇門  開始于你推門進來
It ends when you walk out that door,and begins when you walk in.

701
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:21,560
我們的加密術就是現實世界
Our encryption is the real world.

702
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,680
那你們之間如何交流?
How do you talk to each other then?

703
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,960
我們不交流
We don't.

704
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,960
我們時進時出 在我們有空的時候來進行這個項目
We come and go, work on the project when we can.

705
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,920
那你如何能夠相信他們?
How do you trust them?

706
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,920
我對每個人都有測試
I give them an exercise.

707
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:37,080
如果他們通過了 那就加入我們 如果他們沒通過...
If they pass, they join us. If they fail

708
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:40,020
那么昨晚的分布式拒絕服務攻擊
The DDoS attack last night,

709
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:43,520
就是你在測試我嘍
you were testing me.

710
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:51,560
你說過你們有個項目
You said there was a project.

711
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:55,060
- 是什么項目? - 那件事過會兒再議
-What's the project? -That'll come later.

712
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:58,840
我現在只是想讓你來看看這個地方
I just wanted you to see the place.

713
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:07,980
要是沒有中心處理器 你也巧婦難為無米之炊
There's not much you can do without a CPU.

714
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:12,820
我瘋了
I'm crazy.

715
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:15,940
我一定是瘋了因為剛才的一切的確是發生了 對么?
I have to be crazy because that didn't just happen, right?

716
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:17,800
這是都是幻想  這是幻想么?
This is a delusion. Is this a delusion?

717
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:21,160
該死 我有精神分裂癥了
Shit, I'm a schizo.

718
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,520
我這次是真的迷失了么?
Have I really lost it this time?

719
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,760
不 不 昨晚發生的事的確是真的
No, no. Last night happened. It was real.

720
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,140
安吉拉給我打電話了 我是去了全安全公司
Angela called me. I was at AllSafe.

721
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:29,140
邪惡公司的服務器的確癱瘓了
Evil Corp's servers were compromised.

722
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,500
那些都是事實 不是幻覺
Those are facts,not delusions

723
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:35,140
我知道的 我知道的 我知道的 我知道我是在跟一個幻想中的人在說這些事兒
I know. I know, I know I realize I'm saying all of this to an imaginary person,

724
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:36,980
但是是我創造了你
but I created you.

725
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,940
我可沒造這一堆破事兒
I didn't create this.

726
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:41,560
噢 還好你回來了
Oh, thank God you're here.

727
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:44,860
我正要去星巴克等你呢
I was just about to go wait in the Starbucks.

728
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:47,720
你住的這個社區很爛 你知道么?
You live in a bad neighborhood. Do you know that?

729
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,700
我知道
I do know that.

730
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:54,990
你想喝高點然后一起看你喜歡的電影么?
Do you want to get high and watch your favorite movie?

731
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:56,900
喔 你昨晚救了我們
Oh, you saved our asses last night

732
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:00,060
我本以為吉迪恩一定會炒了我的
I thought Gideon was definitely gonna fire me.

733
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:01,600
你去哪兒了?
Where have you been?

734
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,100
我以為你會在睡覺呢
I thought you'd be sleeping.

735
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:08,440
我..嗯 我在地鐵上睡著了
I--yeah, I fell asleep on the train.

736
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:12,200
這聽上去就像是謊話
That sounds like such a lie,

737
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:16,420
但是 不管怎么樣 我現在不想知道
but, whatever. I don't want to get into that right now.

738
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:19,800
所以我們到底要不要喝酒看電影??
So you want to do this?

739
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,360
我都想庫爾提了
I miss Qwerty.

740
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,780
希望她還愛我
I hope she still loves me.

741
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,380
見鬼
Shit.

742
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:38,860
她不該出現在這兒的 好么?
She wasn't supposed to be here, okay?

743
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,160
給我一分鐘我會處理掉她的
Give me a minute and I'll get rid of her.

744
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:44,260
沒事的  呃...
That's okay. Um...

745
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:46,980
這挺棒的
This is great.

746
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,900
- 伊利艾特 我很替你高興 - 不 事情不是這樣的
-Elliot, I'm happy for you. -No, it's not like that.

747
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:52,300
嗯 也許其實也不錯 你知道么?
Well, maybe it should be,you know?

748
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:56,680
你在約會其實...挺好的
It's good that you're...dating.

749
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,880
嗯 我們周一再見嘍
Well, I'll see you on Monday.

750
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,280
我們下次再一起看電影吧
We can do movie night next time.

751
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:08,000
我保證 好么?
I promise, okay?

752
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,540
嗯
Yeah.

753
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,460
玩的開心喲
Have fun.

754
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,840
嗯..伊利艾特?
Mm, Elliot?

755
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:39,080
噢 混蛋 現在已經是周三了么?
Oh, shit. Is it Wednesday?

756
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:42,260
- 夏拉 - 我得去換邊停車了
-Shayla. -I have to move my car.

757
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:45,600
夏拉 離開這里
Shayla, leave.

758
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:49,920
馬上
Now.

759
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,100
從來沒有關于機器人先生的信息哪里都沒有
No mention of Mr. Robot anywhere.

760
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:56,920
也沒有關于"F社會"的信息
No mention of F-society.

761
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,840
任何黑客論壇上都沒有
Not on any of the hacker boards.

762
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:01,160
網上交談 論壇 博客上通通沒有
Not on IRC, forums, blogs,

763
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,660
沒有人聽說過他們
no one's heard of them.

764
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:09,860
那片地產13年來歸開心社會娛樂有限公司所有
Property was owned by Fun Society Amusement, LLC for 13 years.

765
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:13,120
產權人在一年半前被殺了
Owner was shot a killed a year and a half ago.

766
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,900
自此便成為無主地
No owner since.

767
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:18,700
而且在此之前的所有權歷史信息根本不存在
And the ownership history before that is sparse to nonexistent.

768
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:22,460
這個人很強啊 相當強
This guy is good. Very good.

769
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,740
不管了
Doesn't matter.

770
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:34,000
他們的網絡地址都在那個數據文件里
Their arcade network's IP is in the dat file

771
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:38,260
用來舉報他們足夠了
That'll be enough to turn them in.

772
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:55,460
你有何企圖 機器人先生?
What's your ask, Mr. Robot?

773
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:06,960
嘿 兄弟
Hey, man,

774
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:10,400
你老大在哪?
where's your boss?

775
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:12,360
好吧 別說廢話
Okay, cut the bullshit.

776
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:16,540
你什么時候才能給我們根目錄的權限?
When are you going to give us access to the root directory?

777
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:17,720
什么?
What?

778
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:20,900
省省吧 老兄 我寫的那個隱匿公式
Dude, come on. I wrote that rootkit.

779
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:24,760
我還得在那個數據文件上加上科爾比的網絡地址才行
I still have to put Colby's IP in the dat file.

780
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,860
傻蛋
Dickhead.

781
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:36,520
伊利艾特! 好消息
Elliot! Good news.

782
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,800
我搶到了最后一袋超市的夾餡面包
I scored the last bag of Twinkies from Gristedes.

783
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,700
來一個么?
You want one?

784
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:42,600
她剛才居然叫我傻蛋
She just called me a dickhead.

785
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:45,040
嗯哼 那是戴琳
Yeah, that's Darlene.

786
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:49,520
嘿 你喜歡摩天輪么?
Hey, you like Ferris wheels?

787
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:54,840
噢 太美了
Ah, it's beautiful.

788
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:58,180
越高風景越好 你知道么?
Gets better the higher up you go, you know?

789
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,720
噢 我太喜歡這兒了
Oh, I love it up here.

790
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:04,180
你喜歡么?
You like it?

791
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:07,960
我來是告訴你 我要去舉報你們
I'm here to tell you I'm turning you in.

792
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:12,740
-我要給他們你們所有的信息 -讓我來告訴你 你來的真正原因
I'm giving them all the information.  -Let me tell you why you're really here.

793
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:16,840
你來這兒是因為 你感覺這個世界有什么不對
You're here because you sense something wrong with the world.

794
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:19,780
一些你無法解釋的事
Something you can't explain.

795
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:24,340
但是你知道它控制了你 和你身邊你在乎的所有人
But you know it controls you and everyone you care about.

796
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:26,960
你在說什么呢?
What are you talking about?

797
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:31,640
金錢
Money.

798
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:36,680
自從我們廢除金本位制以來  錢都不再是實體了 變成虛擬的了
Money hasn't been real since we got off the gold standard. It's become virtual.

799
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,060
是種軟件
Software.

800
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:41,380
這是我們這個世界運行的機制
The operating system of our world.

801
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,540
還有 伊利艾特 我們馬上就要
And, Elliot, we are on the verge

802
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:48,440
拿下這種虛擬現實了
of taking down this virtual reality.

803
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:50,880
想想吧
Think about it.

804
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:56,240
如果你能拿下一個企業那會是怎樣?
What if you could take down one conglomerate?

805
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:01,640
一個與世界經濟緊密相關的大企業
A conglomerate so deeply entrenched in the world's economy,

806
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:05,240
那可是大成功啊 我甚至都沒辦法描述它
that too big to fail doesn't even come close to describing it.

807
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:08,320
你想再創造一場金融危機嗎
You want to create another financial meltdown

808
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:11,140
就像我們剛剛經歷的這場 但比它還糟糕
like the one we just had,but way worse.

809
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:13,180
是啊 我又為什么想要這么做呢?
Yeah, why would I want that?

810
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:14,860
每個人都會損失他們的錢財
Everyone would lose their money.

811
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:21,220
如果我告訴你這個企業恰巧持有全球70%消費者信用行業的股份呢?哈?
What if I told you that this conglomerate just so happens to own 70% of the global consumer credit industry?

812
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:23,020
如果我們能準確地黑入他們的數據中心
If we hit their data center just right,

813
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:25,660
我們就能系統地格式化所用用戶的資料
we could systematically format all the servers

814
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:29,660
- 包括備份 - 這樣會清除掉...
-including backup. -That would erase all

815
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:30,660
我們欠的所有債
All the debt we owe them.

816
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:34,980
每一筆信用卡 貸款 抵押的記錄都會被清除
Every record of every credit card, loan, and mortgage would be wiped clean.

817
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:38,220
強化那些過時的紙質記錄是不可能的
It would be impossible to reinforce outdated paper records.

818
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,920
所有一切都煙消云散
It would all be gone.

819
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:47,540
人類歷史上最大的財產重新分配事件
The single biggest incident of wealth redistribution in history.

820
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:56,940
邪惡公司 你說的那個公司
Evil Corp. The conglomerate.

821
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:59,540
這就是你選我的原因啊
That's why you picked me.

822
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:01,940
因為我在全安全工作
Because I work at AllSafe.

823
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:05,990
明天 全安全將會有聯邦調查局
Tomorrow, AllSafe is going to get a visit from the FBI

824
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:08,400
和美國網絡司令部的人到訪
and the U.S. Cyber Command.

825
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:12,400
你去修改那個數字文件
You are going to modify the dat file

826
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:17,620
把科爾比的IP終端地址放進去
and put Colby's terminal IP address in there.

827
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:19,980
泰利 科爾比嗎?
Terry Colby?

828
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:21,580
你準備陷害他?
You're gonna frame him?

829
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:23,100
沒人會相信的
No one's gonna believe that.

830
00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:26,240
我見過他 他就是個腦殘
I met him, he's a moron.

831
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:28,200
FBI不也是么
So are the FBI.

832
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,180
即使他們不相信是他做的
Even if they don't believe he did it,

833
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:33,360
他們也會相信是他幫了別人做的
they'll believehe gave someone access to it.

834
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,160
是啊 然后他就是會進監獄而已
Yeah, he'll just go to jail.

835
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:36,500
那有什么用啊?
What good will that do?

836
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:39,960
要扳倒一個大的企業集團是不能瞄準核心一擊斃命的
You don't take down a conglomerate by shooting them in the heart.

837
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,560
大企業集團就是這樣
That's the thing about conglomerates,

838
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:43,620
他們沒有核心
they don't have hearts.

839
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:45,990
要一點一點的瓦解掉
You take them down limb by limb.

840
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:47,820
隨著企業慢慢被拆散
And as they unravel,

841
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:51,240
他們一手掌控的錯覺也會瓦解
their illusion of control unravels.

842
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:59,300
你是誰?
Who are you?

843
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,860
你以后再知道也不遲
That'll come later.

844
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:06,400
現在 你有很多事需要好好想想
Right now, you have a lot to think about.

845
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,600
你得修改那個數據文件
You have to change the dat file

846
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:11,990
然后把科爾比的IP輸進去
and put Colby's IP in there.

847

865
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,590
若你留下 ?
But if you stay ?

866
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:26,910
我會陪在你身邊 ?
I'll make you a day ?

867
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:29,260
讓你的一天 ?
Like no day's been ?

868
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:32,040
永生難忘 ?
Or will be again ?

869
00:49:32,810 --> 00:49:34,700
我們在陽光下起航 ?

881
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:14,040

你一臉茫然 ?

如今我是否可以坦白 ?

889
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:38,040
當你轉身離開 ?
As you turn to go ?

890
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:41,380
我將慢慢老去 ?

全球貧富差距值達20年來新高且仍在擴大

898
00:50:25,810 --> 00:50:27,980
邪惡總會勝利

899
00:50:55,550 --> 00:50:58,660
那么 我們開始吧?
So, what do we got?

900
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:03,300
你們看一下日程的第一頁
So, if you'll take a look at the first page of your agenda--

901
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:05,990
是你阻止了黑客入侵
You're the one who stopped the hack.

902
00:51:05,990 --> 00:51:09,520
你們知道么 分析部的姑娘們說這次挺難搞的
You know, the gals in analysis said this was a tough one.

903
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:10,990
正常情況下
All things being equal,

904
00:51:10,990 --> 00:51:13,540
這次入侵可能會讓我們當掉好多天 所以...
it should have shut us down for days, so...

905
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:15,400
干得漂亮
you did good.

906
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:18,100
恩
Okay.

907
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:22,800
我們應該先從客戶經理 安吉拉開始
We should start with our account executive, Angela.

908
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,880
好的 我們初次注意到被攻擊
Okay, we first noticed the breach

909
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:28,300
是在周五晚上 是東部標準時間上午兩點零七分
2:07 A.M. Eastern Standard on Friday night.

910
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:30,990
你是說周六?
You mean, Saturday?

911
00:51:30,990 --> 00:51:34,460
抱歉 是的 準確的講 是周六早晨
Sorry, yes, technically, Saturday morning.

912
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:36,280
好的 安吉拉
Yeah, okay, Angela,

913
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:39,860
我們在這開會就是為了這個 準確的技術細節
that's what we're here for. The technicals.

914
00:51:39,990 --> 00:51:41,990
好的
Right.

915
00:51:41,990 --> 00:51:43,800
恩
Yes.

916
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:46,990
總之 他在35分的時候到達辦公室 然后我告訴
Anyway, he arrived at the office35 and I instru--

917
00:51:46,990 --> 00:51:47,770
好吧 等等 停一下
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

918
00:51:47,770 --> 00:51:50,740
這么說那已經是初次被攻擊之后半個小時了
So that's almost a half hour after the initial breach.

919
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:52,580
為什么沒有人用筆記本接進來?
Why didn't anyone pipe in from their laptops?

920
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:54,900
- 規定流程不是那樣的 - 那樣并不安全
- It's not protocol - It wouldn't have been secure

921
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:58,300
如果讓人通過終端登入這個
if someone terminaled in on this.

922
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:02,320
等有人過來 然后通過安全線路
It was the smarter move to have someone come in

923
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,960
- 登錄是更好地做法 - 正是如此
-so they can log in on a secure line. -Exactly.

924
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:08,990
- 那樣羅伊德就能 - 等 等等 打斷一下--
Then Lloyd was able to -Just--just actually, just one second.

925
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,440
恩
- Yeah.

926
00:52:21,990 --> 00:52:23,990
你知道的 我 呃
You know, I, uh,

927
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:27,260
我一直很喜歡這里的風景
I always loved this view.

928
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:45,720
現在 既然那件事已經解決了
Now that that's taken care of,

929
00:52:45,770 --> 00:52:47,990
那我們就繼續之前的話題吧
let's pick it up where we left off.

930
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:49,990
安吉拉怎么了?
What happened to Angela?

931
00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:50,990
她更清楚到底發生了什么
She knows more about what happened.

932
00:52:50,990 --> 00:52:53,990
她對我們不會有很有用的 起碼在這個層面不會
She's not going to work out for us, not on this level.

933
00:52:53,990 --> 00:52:57,240
我們現在需要堅持從更技術的角度看
We need to stick to the more tech savvy here.

934
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:01,840
好了 咱們來討論一下這件事的核心
Now, let's get to the heart of this thing

935
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:07,040
我不能一直坐在這花上20分鐘慢慢瀏覽文件
because I can't sit hereand look through a packet for the next 20 minutes.

936
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:10,100
好了 到底是誰做的?
All right, just who did this?

937
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:11,990
就這么難?
Is it that hard?

938
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:14,940
誰做的?
Who did this?

939
00:53:15,990 --> 00:53:21,600
我發現這個惡意程序配置文件的IP地址有固定的模式
I found the configuration file of the rootkit with a pattern of IP addresses.

940
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:28,840
一但能夠破譯就會知道黑客在哪里
Once you decrypt it, you'll know where the hack came from

941
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:41,860
19天
19 days.

942
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:49,020
沒有新聞 沒有拘捕 也沒有革命
No news, no arrests,no revolution

943
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:05,780
沒有FBI 科爾比和邪惡公司
No FBI, Colby, Evil Corp.

944
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:22,160
沒有機器人先生
No Mr. Robot.

945
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:24,460
沒有F社會
No fsociety.

946
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:36,480
我需要轉移一下注意力
I need to take my mind off things.

947
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:46,820

With those details plus Na dictionary brute-force attack,it'll take my program maybe two minutes to crack his password.

960
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,820
我愿放棄一切只為做一個普通的人
What I wouldn't give to be normal.

961
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:39,620
生活在美好的幻想中
To live in that bubble,

962
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:43,990
天真之人的現實
the reality of the naive.

963
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:50,040
我就是這樣看待這件事的

964

為了保護他們樂觀的赤子之心

為了保護他們

How? He's too old to have a complicated password

967
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:06,990
肯定是這些信息的某種組合
It had to have been a combination of these things.

983
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:06,920
警察?
The police?

984
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:09,900
是啊 有一個應召女郎只有15歲
Yeah, one of the escorts was 15.

985
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:14,840
15歲的部分是我編的
That 15 part I made up,

986
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:18,200
但是他確實有偏好年輕女孩的傾向  所以幫我圓了謊
but he did have a proclivity for young escorts that helped the lie.

987
00:57:18,290 --> 00:57:19,600
但是我不會那樣做的
But I'm not gonna do any of that

988
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:22,720
只要你和克里斯塔分手
as long as you break up with Krista.

989
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:25,360
今晚就分
Tonight.

990
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:30,500
成交
Done.

991
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:33,760
你還得告訴她事情的真相
You're also gonna tell her the truth.

992
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:36,000
告訴她你已經結婚了 你對自己的妻子不忠
That you're married,cheat on your wife,

993
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,860
花錢嫖娼
you hire hookers.

994
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:41,400
你從來沒有任何想與她認真交往的念頭
That you never had any intention of being serious with her.

995
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:42,640
為什么?
Why?

996
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:45,840
那樣會毀了她的 她以為...
That would destroy her. She thinks that...

997
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:47,740
我們是相愛的
We're in love.

998
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:52,260
正是如此 以后克里斯塔需要避開像你這種混蛋
Exactly. Krista needs to avoid dickheads like you in the future.

999
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:54,420
她探測男人的雷達需要修一修了
Her radar needs fixing.

1000
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:57,120
如果你漏掉任何細節我都會知道的
I'll know if you skip any detail.

1001
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:59,660
所以不要有遺漏
So don't.

1002
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,380
還有一件事...
And one more thing...

1003
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:08,080
我還需要你的一件東西
I'm gonna need something from you.

1004
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:13,040
來吧
Come on.

1005
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:28,660
我挺喜歡你的 鰭鰭
I like you, Flipper.

1006
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:30,740
你很酷
You're cool.

1007
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:34,800
我從來都不希望我的侵入是對的
I never want to be right about my hacks,

1008
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:37,660
但是人們總有各種各樣的方式讓我大失所望
but people always find a way to disappoint.

1009
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:47,600
邁克爾 漢森現在已經和其他人一樣被歸檔了
Michael Hansen now gets filed away among the others.

1010
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:50,990
永久封存在我的數字檔案中
Forever buried in my digital cemetery.

1011
00:58:58,460 --> 00:59:01,220
一切幻滅的表情
The look of disillusionment.

1012
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:03,560
他告訴她了 她哭了一整晚
He told her. She cried all night.

1013
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:05,340
現在到了感傷的階段
Now comes the sadness.

1014
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:09,660
我不喜歡看她傷心
I don't like seeing her sad.

1015
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:14,760
- 你還好嗎?- 抱歉
- You okay?- Sorry.

1016
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:16,660
抱歉
Sorry.

1017
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:20,460
繼續吧
Go on.

1018
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:26,400
我覺得安吉拉認為邪惡公司會議上發生的情況應該怪我
I think Angela blames me for what happened at the Evil Corp meeting.

1019
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,880
我該怎么辦? 我得和她談談
What do I do? I need to talk to her.

1020
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:32,180
你剛剛不是回答了自己的問題
I think you just answered your own question.

1021
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:33,920
和她談談
Talk to her.

1022
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:36,580
她不回我的短信或者是郵件
She won't respond to any of my texts or emails.

1023
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:38,820
那就當面去找她
Then go to her in person.

1024
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:41,300
告訴她你想和她談談
Tell her you need to talk

1025
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:45,000
溝通是關鍵 伊利艾特
Communication is key,Elliot.

1026
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,520
真正的人際互動
Real human interaction.

1027
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:53,990
這才是現在對你來說真正重要的
That's what's important for you right now.

1028
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:08,320
嘿 你 你覺得我們現在能談談嗎?
Hey. Do you-- Do you think we can talk?

1029
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:09,620
什么?
- What?

1030
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:10,780
你不愿跟我說話
You won't talk to me.

1031
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:12,880
自從開完會之后 你就沒和我說過話
You haven't talked to mes ince the meeting.

1032
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:16,400
我不想和你說話 因為我覺得很尷尬
I don't want to talk to you because I feel embarrassed

1033
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:19,420
每當我一想起所發生的事情
every time I think about what happened.

1034
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:20,900
行了嗎?
Okay?

1035
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:24,080
沒事的 我會克服的
It's fine. I'll get over it.

1036
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:25,840
- 都三個禮拜了 - 我得繼續工作了
- It's been three weeks. - I have to get back to work.

1037
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:29,440
- 你就準備這樣無視我? - 你在會上的時候不必幫我說話的
You're just going to ignore me? -You didn't have to stick up for me in there

1038
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:31,540
我知道你僅僅是想幫我
I know that you were just trying to help,

1039
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:34,380
不過不要再那樣做了
just don't do it again.

1040
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:36,500
即使我撐不下去了
Even if I'm losing.

1041
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:39,200
那就讓我輸了吧 好嗎?
Let me lose, okay?

1042
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:43,180
不要露出迷茫的表情
Don't look confused.

1043
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:45,300
答應就好了
Just say it.

1044
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,620
說"好的"
"Okay."

01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:53,760
好的
Okay.

1046
01:01:08,620 --> 01:01:11,990
伊利艾特

泰利 科爾比被拘留

1050

to pressure Evil Corp during his contract negotiations.

It's happening, it's happening,it's happening, it's happening.
