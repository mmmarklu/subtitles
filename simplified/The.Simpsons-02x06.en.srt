1
00:00:05,653 --> 00:00:07,211
Bart the Daredevil

2
00:01:22,453 --> 00:01:26,605
Live from Springfield,
the wrestling match of the century!

3
00:01:26,813 --> 00:01:31,204
-Rasputin, the Friendly Russian.
-Wasn't he the Mad Russian?

4
00:01:31,453 --> 00:01:35,526
History has changed wrestling,
perhaps forever.

5
00:01:35,733 --> 00:01:40,807
The challenger from Heidelberg,
Professor Burnabon Brawn. With a "W. "

6
00:01:41,013 --> 00:01:46,326
Two titans in their prime. This is
going to be one hell of a match!

7
00:01:46,533 --> 00:01:49,286
I hope you're not
taking this seriously.

8
00:01:49,493 --> 00:01:52,963
5-year-olds know this is
as choreographed as ballet.

9
00:01:53,373 --> 00:01:57,969
Rasputin's got the reach, but
the Professor's got his coma lock.

10
00:01:58,173 --> 00:02:00,733
This is gonna be one hell of a match.

11
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:05,963
Look at that showoff,
kissing his own muscles.

12
00:02:07,173 --> 00:02:10,882
He's spinning the Professor!
That's disorienting!

13
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:13,926
Hey, Milhouse, crank it up.

14
00:02:15,893 --> 00:02:19,203
-That's my seat.
-Correction, was your seat.

15
00:02:19,413 --> 00:02:21,881
But I only got up to go to the can.

16
00:02:22,093 --> 00:02:25,165
I don't see your name
on this barstool.

17
00:02:25,373 --> 00:02:27,204
One! Two! Three!

18
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:29,210
Four! Five! Six!

19
00:02:29,413 --> 00:02:31,563
Seven! Eight! Nine!

20
00:02:31,773 --> 00:02:35,083
The ref is issuing
a warning to Rasputin.

21
00:02:37,253 --> 00:02:41,769
Oh, my. Oh, my.
Why is this referee permitting this?

22
00:02:50,453 --> 00:02:53,809
This Saturday,
your life will be changed forever.

23
00:02:54,133 --> 00:02:57,409
Saturday, at the Springfield Speedway.

24
00:02:57,613 --> 00:03:01,811
"Crusher" Woodard, "The Skunk"
Trumane and the Dunk Masters...

25
00:03:02,053 --> 00:03:04,408
...in the Monster Truck Rally!

26
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:08,806
Plus the amazing, unbelievable,
Truck-a-saurus!

27
00:03:09,013 --> 00:03:14,246
Twenty tons and four stories of
car-crunching, fire-breathing insanity!

28
00:03:15,733 --> 00:03:18,930
One night only,
at the Springfield Speedway!

29
00:03:19,173 --> 00:03:24,486
If you miss it, you better be dead or
in jail. If you're in jail, break out!

30
00:03:24,733 --> 00:03:26,246
Be there!

31
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:38,052
Truck-a-saurus!

32
00:03:41,733 --> 00:03:45,282
I have an announcement.
As a family growth thing...

33
00:03:45,533 --> 00:03:49,287
...we should go to the
Monster Truck Rally this Saturday.

34
00:03:49,493 --> 00:03:51,882
Aren't you forgetting something?

35
00:03:52,133 --> 00:03:55,603
Monster Truck Rally, growth thing,
I don't think so.

36
00:03:55,813 --> 00:03:57,724
Lisa's recital is Saturday.

37
00:03:57,973 --> 00:04:03,809
I have my first solo. If you miss it,
start looking for a child therapist.

38
00:04:04,013 --> 00:04:10,612
-But Truck-a-saurus is one night only!
-Cruel fate, why do you mock me?

39
00:04:10,853 --> 00:04:14,482
Come on.
What time does your truck game start?

40
00:04:14,933 --> 00:04:19,484
-8:00, but what does it matter?
-Lisa's recital starts at 5:00.

41
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:24,005
-We can go to both.
-Marge, you're a genius!

42
00:04:24,213 --> 00:04:27,728
Let's have good assembly manners.
People! People!

43
00:04:29,453 --> 00:04:33,446
Quiet, please! Don't make me
flick the lights on and off.

44
00:04:33,653 --> 00:04:34,847
Thank you.

45
00:04:35,053 --> 00:04:40,127
Ladies, gentlemen, parents. Welcome
to the first in a series of concerts.

46
00:04:40,733 --> 00:04:42,132
Series!

47
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:46,611
Tonight, Sherbert's--
Schubert's Unfinished Symphony.

48
00:04:46,813 --> 00:04:49,805
Good, unfinished.
This shouldn't take long.

49
00:04:50,013 --> 00:04:54,689
Remember, children, stay together.
Five, six, seven, eight!

50
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:21,807
-That was beautiful. Can we go now?
-Sit down, Homer.

51
00:05:24,293 --> 00:05:28,525
How much longer was Sherbert
planning on making this?

52
00:05:29,173 --> 00:05:32,802
Lisa was great.
Her fingering's come a long way.

53
00:05:33,053 --> 00:05:37,524
-Thanks, Flanders. Big know-it-all.
-When's Todd's solo, Dad?

54
00:05:37,773 --> 00:05:40,606
It's coming up, son.
It's coming up.

55
00:05:52,493 --> 00:05:57,692
-My son, my son.
-Come on, Flanders. He's not that bad.

56
00:06:31,973 --> 00:06:34,612
-I reached him.
-Drive defensively.

57
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:40,883
-The best defense is a good offense.
-Faster, Dad. Truck-a-saurus awaits!

58
00:06:42,653 --> 00:06:44,132
Damn, no spots!

59
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,893
I think there's one over there.

60
00:06:54,693 --> 00:06:57,730
-Dad?
-Not now, Lisa. Come on.

61
00:06:57,973 --> 00:06:59,691
-Homer.
-What?

62
00:07:00,093 --> 00:07:03,085
-Truck-a-saurus!
-Where? Where?

63
00:07:21,453 --> 00:07:24,684
Pull! Pull, you dogs!

64
00:07:24,893 --> 00:07:28,169
Let's see, cracked windshield,
melted bumpers...

65
00:07:28,373 --> 00:07:32,082
...punctured radiator,
teeth marks in the trunk.

66
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:34,563
At least there's no frame damage.

67
00:07:35,253 --> 00:07:38,290
-This check should handle it.
-Thank you.

68
00:07:38,493 --> 00:07:42,884
I'm Leo G. Clark, inventor
and operator of Truck-a-saurus.

69
00:07:43,093 --> 00:07:47,405
Truck-a-saurus feels
very badly about what happened.

70
00:07:47,653 --> 00:07:53,091
We'd like you to have a half-bottle of
champagne for being such good sports.

71
00:07:53,293 --> 00:07:58,492
Thank you. Everyone's so nice here,
at the Monster Truck Rally.

72
00:07:58,693 --> 00:08:01,287
Look, Homer, champagne!

73
00:08:03,853 --> 00:08:07,323
Now, Majestic Undercoating
is proud to present:

74
00:08:07,573 --> 00:08:09,882
Ms. Monster!

75
00:08:10,133 --> 00:08:12,488
Wow, a woman mud pool driver.

76
00:08:12,773 --> 00:08:17,289
Another barrier broken.
Right on, sister!

77
00:08:17,493 --> 00:08:22,089
Let the destruction begin!
Hey, they forgot my corn dogs.

78
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:26,286
-Give me some nachos, Homer-saurus.
-Here, Bart-a-saurus.

79
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:32,888
Now, we have a surprise guest.
The world's greatest daredevil.

80
00:08:33,173 --> 00:08:35,323
He's no stranger to danger.

81
00:08:35,573 --> 00:08:40,693
If he's not in action, he's in
traction. Captain Lance Murdock!

82
00:08:42,973 --> 00:08:46,682
Ladies and gentlemen,
and especially little children.

83
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:51,489
I'm glad you're here to witness
what may be my grisly death.

84
00:08:51,733 --> 00:08:54,327
Tonight, my most dangerous stunt.

85
00:08:54,573 --> 00:08:59,363
I will death defy nature and gravity
by leaping over this water tank...

86
00:08:59,573 --> 00:09:02,292
...filled with great white sharks...

87
00:09:02,493 --> 00:09:06,930
...deadly electric eels,
ravenous piranhas, alligators...

88
00:09:07,173 --> 00:09:10,688
...and most frightening,
the king of the jungle...

89
00:09:10,933 --> 00:09:13,845
...one ferocious lion!

90
00:09:17,573 --> 00:09:21,612
I almost forgot.
To add a real element of danger...

91
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:25,687
...one drop of human blood.

92
00:09:27,493 --> 00:09:30,690
On the chance I don't live,
let me say...

93
00:09:30,933 --> 00:09:34,812
...seat belts save lives,
so buckle up!

94
00:09:38,213 --> 00:09:41,489
This is so cool.

95
00:09:45,973 --> 00:09:48,362
Oh, I can't watch!

96
00:09:54,373 --> 00:09:56,011
He made it!

97
00:10:05,693 --> 00:10:07,285
Bitchen!

98
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:12,082
He's okay, folks!

99
00:10:21,933 --> 00:10:25,084
What a fun-filled evening.

100
00:10:25,933 --> 00:10:30,006
Ladies and gentlemen,
a 10-year-old who's brave and bold!

101
00:10:30,253 --> 00:10:32,813
When he's not in class,
he risks his ass!

102
00:10:33,053 --> 00:10:36,090
The greatest daredevil,
Bart Simpson!

103
00:10:36,293 --> 00:10:37,772
Bart! Bart!

104
00:10:42,373 --> 00:10:46,491
Bart? Bart? We're home, son.

105
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:53,532
-Dad, I wanna be a daredevil.
-Kids say such stupid things.

106
00:10:57,453 --> 00:11:00,092
-You're crazy.
-You'll never make it.

107
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:03,086
Spare me your lectures, ladies.

108
00:11:09,853 --> 00:11:11,491
-Oh, no! He's hurt!
-Bad!

109
00:11:11,693 --> 00:11:14,287
Let's get out of here!

110
00:11:22,853 --> 00:11:27,290
-My little boy!
-Come on, Marge, we're mad at him.

111
00:11:27,533 --> 00:11:32,084
-Are you all right?
-Better than all right. I got stitches!

112
00:11:32,373 --> 00:11:33,726
Probably a scar too.

113
00:11:33,973 --> 00:11:38,808
Bart says he got hurt training
for a career in death defiance?

114
00:11:39,053 --> 00:11:41,931
Yes, we saw a daredevil last night...

115
00:11:42,173 --> 00:11:44,733
...and monkey see, monkey do.

116
00:11:44,973 --> 00:11:48,727
I know something that may
discourage this behavior.

117
00:11:48,973 --> 00:11:52,329
These children have
been hurt doing stunts...

118
00:11:52,573 --> 00:11:56,885
...they saw on television,
movies and the legitimate stage.

119
00:11:57,973 --> 00:12:03,491
This little boy broke his leg
trying to fly like Superman.

120
00:12:04,053 --> 00:12:08,763
His brother hit him with a wrench,
mimicking a TV wrestling match.

121
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:12,803
I won't show the horrors
of our Three Stooges ward.

122
00:12:13,013 --> 00:12:16,164
I didn't know TV was
a dangerous influence.

123
00:12:16,533 --> 00:12:22,085
It's tragic, but it's a small price
to pay for top-notch entertainment.

124
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:25,131
Amen!
Has Dr. Hibbert made his point?

125
00:12:25,373 --> 00:12:30,493
He certainly has. I learned a
real lesson. Thanks, Dr. Hibbert.

126
00:12:40,533 --> 00:12:42,842
-I did it.
-Wow! All right!

127
00:12:46,493 --> 00:12:48,290
Way happening!

128
00:12:48,533 --> 00:12:51,252
-Awesome!
-You're the king!

129
00:12:51,453 --> 00:12:55,287
Thank you! How about a hand
for these brave animals?

130
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:02,292
Hi, kids. Thanks.

131
00:13:02,973 --> 00:13:05,931
Okay, field-trippers. Off the bus.

132
00:13:06,253 --> 00:13:09,723
-What's the matter?
-I'm running on empty, Milhouse.

133
00:13:09,973 --> 00:13:13,329
You kids like my jumps,
and I love you for it...

134
00:13:13,573 --> 00:13:15,370
...but it's too easy.

135
00:13:15,573 --> 00:13:18,531
There must be a challenge
worthy of me.

136
00:13:18,733 --> 00:13:21,725
Hi, children.
Welcome to Springfield Gorge.

137
00:13:21,973 --> 00:13:23,452
Wow!

138
00:13:23,733 --> 00:13:29,091
Gnarly! I bet you could toss a body in
there and no one would ever find it.

139
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:33,406
Otto, I'm gonna jump
Springfield Gorge on my skateboard.

140
00:13:33,693 --> 00:13:37,481
As the only adult here,
I feel I should say something.

141
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:40,884
-What?
-Cool!

142
00:13:50,733 --> 00:13:53,691
Hey, Otto! Can I use that microphone?

143
00:13:55,133 --> 00:13:59,206
Sorry, Bart-dude.
It's for emergencies only.

144
00:13:59,453 --> 00:14:02,650
-I wanna tell them about my jump.
-Okay.

145
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:04,731
Attention, please.

146
00:14:04,973 --> 00:14:08,363
This Saturday I'll be jumping
Springfield Gorge.

147
00:14:08,573 --> 00:14:13,328
There's a good chance I'll fall
to my death. Hope to see you there!

148
00:14:13,933 --> 00:14:17,289
Springfield Gorge! You'll be killed!

149
00:14:17,493 --> 00:14:22,123
I can't explain it, but I get the
same thrill from jumping stuff...

150
00:14:22,373 --> 00:14:24,887
...that you do from reading.

151
00:14:25,093 --> 00:14:28,972
Before you do anything,
there's someone you should talk to.

152
00:14:29,373 --> 00:14:31,329
Thanks for arranging this.

153
00:14:31,573 --> 00:14:35,361
Anything that decreases
entertainment-related injuries.

154
00:14:35,573 --> 00:14:39,612
You're meeting the world's
best daredevil, Lance Murdock.

155
00:14:39,853 --> 00:14:44,529
This is Lisa and Bart Simpson.
Bart's one of your biggest fans.

156
00:14:44,773 --> 00:14:48,288
It's an honor, Lance.
How you feeling?

157
00:14:50,053 --> 00:14:52,521
Doc, I heard a snap.

158
00:14:52,773 --> 00:14:55,685
I'm afraid it's broken.
That's all of them.

159
00:14:56,173 --> 00:14:58,687
I've broken that dozens of times.

160
00:14:58,933 --> 00:15:01,925
I bet you'd like an autograph. Nurse?

161
00:15:02,173 --> 00:15:04,812
-Who should I make it to?
-Just Bart.

162
00:15:05,053 --> 00:15:09,683
To Bart:
Thanks for visiting me...

163
00:15:09,933 --> 00:15:13,687
...at Springfield General Hospital.

164
00:15:13,933 --> 00:15:18,882
Your visit was a ray of sunshine...

165
00:15:19,093 --> 00:15:22,483
...on an otherwise cloudy day.

166
00:15:22,733 --> 00:15:26,692
Your pal, Captain Lance Murdock.

167
00:15:26,933 --> 00:15:31,927
-Wow, man! Thanks, Lance.
-You're welcome. Take this thing.

168
00:15:32,173 --> 00:15:36,689
My brother's gonna jump
Springfield Gorge on a skateboard.

169
00:15:36,893 --> 00:15:39,691
Could you leave me
with the kids, please?

170
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:43,530
Let me start by saying,
good for you, son.

171
00:15:43,733 --> 00:15:46,293
Good to see kids
interested in danger.

172
00:15:46,493 --> 00:15:49,883
People will say you're nuts.
Maybe they're right.

173
00:15:50,133 --> 00:15:53,603
But the fact is:
bones heal, chicks dig scars...

174
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:59,052
...and the U.S.A. has the best doctor
to daredevil ratio in the world.

175
00:15:59,253 --> 00:16:01,130
-But Captain Murdock--
-Thanks!

176
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:05,008
You're welcome.
Tell the nurse it's my bath time.

177
00:16:05,213 --> 00:16:07,568
Another fringe benefit. Nurse!

178
00:16:07,773 --> 00:16:11,686
Springfield Gorge!
We settled this daredevil junk!

179
00:16:11,933 --> 00:16:15,130
-Squealer.
-Sorry, but if you got hurt or died...

180
00:16:15,373 --> 00:16:18,445
...despite the attention
I'd get, I'd miss you.

181
00:16:18,653 --> 00:16:21,247
-I forbid you to jump.
-You can't.

182
00:16:21,453 --> 00:16:24,889
I can and do! Go to your room!
There, I did it.

183
00:16:25,093 --> 00:16:29,086
I'm glad somebody stepped in
and put an end to this nonsense.

184
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:33,724
You can tell me not to do it,
but you can't watch me 24 hours a day.

185
00:16:33,973 --> 00:16:39,001
And the minute your back is turned,
I'm heading for that gorge.

186
00:16:39,213 --> 00:16:44,446
He's got us. There's nothing
we can do. He's as good as dead.

187
00:16:44,653 --> 00:16:47,645
Homer, you're his father.
Reason with him.

188
00:16:47,853 --> 00:16:50,208
That never works. He's a goner.

189
00:16:50,413 --> 00:16:54,122
Come on, Homer, a heart-to-heart
talk with your son.

190
00:16:54,373 --> 00:16:59,288
-You've got to try.
-Okay, okay. I'll try.

191
00:17:00,133 --> 00:17:03,682
-Bart? What are you doing?!
-Nothing.

192
00:17:03,893 --> 00:17:06,885
-You were gonna jump the gorge.
-Maybe.

193
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:10,927
Look, I know I can't stop you.
I can only ask you...

194
00:17:11,173 --> 00:17:15,849
-...to promise me you won't do it.
-Okay, I promise.

195
00:17:16,053 --> 00:17:18,169
-What?
-You didn't mean that!

196
00:17:18,373 --> 00:17:22,412
This isn't a promise
I don't expect you to keep.

197
00:17:22,653 --> 00:17:25,884
-lf you promise, you have to keep it.
-Why?

198
00:17:26,093 --> 00:17:30,006
If you don't,
I'll never believe you ever again.

199
00:17:30,253 --> 00:17:32,483
-Come on.
-I mean it, boy!

200
00:17:32,973 --> 00:17:37,763
Okay, Dad. I promise.
I won't jump Springfield Gorge.

201
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:39,929
That's my boy.

202
00:17:40,453 --> 00:17:44,082
-How did it go?
-We got a pretty good kid there.

203
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:47,689
Well, he's got a pretty good father.

204
00:17:52,573 --> 00:17:56,885
-Where is he? He said noon.
-He's just building suspense.

205
00:17:57,093 --> 00:18:01,689
-What a showman.
-Look, there he is!

206
00:18:08,973 --> 00:18:13,888
Hey, boy. Wanna toss the old--?!
Why, that little liar!

207
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:17,244
I should have--
And I was gonna play pickle.

208
00:18:48,373 --> 00:18:49,726
Hey, what gives?

209
00:18:49,973 --> 00:18:55,331
I tried ordering you, punishing you,
and I even tried reasoning with you.

210
00:18:55,533 --> 00:18:59,606
-Now, I have to jump the gorge myself.
-What? Why?

211
00:18:59,813 --> 00:19:04,045
You'll see what it's like to watch
a family member risk his life...

212
00:19:04,253 --> 00:19:06,050
...for no good reason!

213
00:19:06,253 --> 00:19:10,531
-Dad, you'll never make it.
-Don't you think I know that?

214
00:19:13,053 --> 00:19:16,045
-Goodbye, son.
-Wait! Don't do it!

215
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:21,772
-I won't jump anymore. I promise!
-Thank God! Thank God!

216
00:19:21,973 --> 00:19:24,533
-I love you, Dad.
-I love you too, son.

217
00:19:24,773 --> 00:19:29,767
I don't think I've ever felt as close
to you as I do right--

218
00:19:37,893 --> 00:19:39,611
I'm gonna make it!

219
00:19:39,853 --> 00:19:44,085
This is the greatest thrill of my life!
I'm king of the world!

220
00:20:24,013 --> 00:20:26,481
Think you got guts?
Try raising my kids!
