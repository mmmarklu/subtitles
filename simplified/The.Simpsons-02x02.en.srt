1
00:00:05,693 --> 00:00:07,206
Simpson and Delilah

2
00:01:19,373 --> 00:01:23,764
The capital of North Dakota is
named after what German ruler?

3
00:01:23,973 --> 00:01:25,486
-Hitler!
-North Dakota?

4
00:01:25,693 --> 00:01:26,682
Bismarck.

5
00:01:26,893 --> 00:01:29,612
-Hitler?
-I'm still beating you, boy.

6
00:01:30,133 --> 00:01:33,967
The colors of the Italian flag
are red, white and what?

7
00:01:34,173 --> 00:01:35,606
-Blue. Red.
-Green.

8
00:01:35,813 --> 00:01:36,802
-Black, green.

9
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:39,083
-Green.
-I was right!

10
00:01:39,453 --> 00:01:43,651
We'll be right back with more
Grade School Challenge.

11
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:46,890
I used to think hair loss
was inevitable.

12
00:01:47,093 --> 00:01:51,006
I found Dimoxinil,
the breakthrough in hair regrowth.

13
00:01:51,213 --> 00:01:54,364
Breakthrough?
There's been a breakthrough?!

14
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:59,203
Dimoxinil can help me grow as
much or as little hair as I want to.

15
00:01:59,613 --> 00:02:01,843
Hey, today I'm gonna do it.

16
00:02:02,173 --> 00:02:05,688
For your free brochure,
send $5 to Dimoxinil.

17
00:02:05,893 --> 00:02:10,489
Hair. Hair.
Just like everybody else.

18
00:02:14,533 --> 00:02:17,093
Some women find bald men
quite virile.

19
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:20,962
Weren't you listening?
This is a breakthrough.

20
00:02:21,213 --> 00:02:24,046
Not one of
these cheap-o sucker deals.

21
00:02:28,053 --> 00:02:31,284
Allow me to present the Dimoxinil
action set.

22
00:02:31,493 --> 00:02:37,807
A six-month supply of the drug, gravity
boots, scalp massager and a T-shirt.

23
00:02:38,013 --> 00:02:40,573
-Great. How much?
-$1000.

24
00:02:40,773 --> 00:02:43,526
A thousand bucks? I can't afford that!

25
00:02:43,733 --> 00:02:47,851
We do have a product which
is more in your price range.

26
00:02:48,093 --> 00:02:52,405
However, any hair growth
while using it will be coincidental.

27
00:02:53,093 --> 00:02:57,928
A thousand bucks. Of all the rip-off
screw job, cheap joint....

28
00:02:59,893 --> 00:03:03,647
Forget you, pal.
Thanks for nothing.

29
00:03:04,013 --> 00:03:07,892
So I say, "Forget you, pal.
Thanks for nothing."

30
00:03:08,093 --> 00:03:10,812
-I storm right out.
-That's telling them.

31
00:03:11,253 --> 00:03:14,723
Out of Tartar Sauce.
They call this a portion?

32
00:03:14,933 --> 00:03:19,131
Are you gonna use your sauce?
Dry fish sticks! This sucks.

33
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:23,611
-Stop whining, chrome dome.
-lf I had hair, you wouldn't say that.

34
00:03:23,853 --> 00:03:25,445
Homer, don't be a sap.

35
00:03:25,653 --> 00:03:30,010
Fill out some insurance forms.
Charge Dimoxinil to the company.

36
00:03:30,213 --> 00:03:32,886
It's $1000.
Burns would can my butt.

37
00:03:33,133 --> 00:03:35,044
Oh, $1000. So what?

38
00:03:35,293 --> 00:03:38,091
So he has one less ivory
back scratcher.

39
00:03:38,293 --> 00:03:41,603
You pay into the insurance fund.
What do you get?

40
00:03:41,853 --> 00:03:43,571
Nothing. The newsletter.

41
00:03:43,773 --> 00:03:48,210
Why get nothing while a guy who
loses a finger hits the jackpot?

42
00:03:48,413 --> 00:03:49,732
You got me.

43
00:03:49,933 --> 00:03:54,768
I'd like to charge that Dimoxinil
stuff to my health insurance.

44
00:03:54,973 --> 00:03:57,362
I don't know who
put you up to this...

45
00:03:57,693 --> 00:04:02,448
...but no insurance plan covers
something as frivolous as Dimoxinil!

46
00:04:05,133 --> 00:04:09,684
Meet me in the alley in 15 minutes.
Come alone.

47
00:04:30,453 --> 00:04:33,251
Dear God, give a bald guy a break.
Amen.

48
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,927
I have hair. I have hair!

49
00:04:58,853 --> 00:05:00,047
I have hair!

50
00:05:01,653 --> 00:05:03,166
Look, look!

51
00:05:03,373 --> 00:05:07,002
Morning, Springfield.
Morning, Mr. and Mrs. Winfield.

52
00:05:07,493 --> 00:05:09,529
Get a haircut, you hippie!

53
00:05:09,733 --> 00:05:13,885
-Good morning, Moe's Tavern!
-It's the president.

54
00:05:14,373 --> 00:05:17,092
-Good morning, everybody.
-Good morning.

55
00:05:17,933 --> 00:05:21,642
Good morning, everybody!
Good morning, Springfield!

56
00:05:22,533 --> 00:05:24,649
Dimoxinil!

57
00:05:49,013 --> 00:05:53,325
Homer Simpson!
You haven't been here in 20 years.

58
00:05:53,533 --> 00:05:57,731
-You got rid of the sideburns.
-Give me the usual.

59
00:05:58,293 --> 00:06:00,249
He's much happier at work.

60
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:04,691
Just between us girls,
he hasn't been this frisky in years.

61
00:06:04,893 --> 00:06:09,444
-I don't want to think about it.
-Daddy's home, sugar.

62
00:06:13,133 --> 00:06:14,646
Come here, you.

63
00:06:14,893 --> 00:06:17,327
Homie, my sisters are here.

64
00:06:17,533 --> 00:06:21,287
Dinner with three beautiful women.
I must be in heaven.

65
00:06:21,493 --> 00:06:22,846
This is Homer?

66
00:06:23,733 --> 00:06:26,611
-Patty, stop drooling.
-Look who's talking.

67
00:06:31,773 --> 00:06:34,367
You look different, Homer.
Lose weight?

68
00:06:34,693 --> 00:06:36,411
You got a tan.

69
00:06:36,613 --> 00:06:38,843
I know what it is, a new tie.

70
00:06:39,053 --> 00:06:43,126
Pathetic morons in my employ,
stealing my precious money.

71
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:46,245
None of these cretins
deserves a promotion.

72
00:06:46,493 --> 00:06:50,281
It's in the union contract.
One token promotion per year.

73
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:53,246
Wait. Who is that young go-getter?

74
00:06:53,453 --> 00:06:57,571
Looks like Homer Simpson,
only more dynamic and resourceful.

75
00:06:57,773 --> 00:07:02,688
Simpson? An unspoiled lump
of clay to mold in my own image.

76
00:07:03,293 --> 00:07:06,808
Our new junior executive!
Bring him to me.

77
00:07:07,253 --> 00:07:11,451
Homer Simpson, you've been
promoted. You're now an executive.

78
00:07:11,653 --> 00:07:14,247
Take three minutes to say goodbye...

79
00:07:14,453 --> 00:07:18,446
...and report to room 503
for reassignment to a better life.

80
00:07:22,093 --> 00:07:27,008
Your "resume" seems in order.
Do you have any specialties?

81
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:30,444
Backrubs for harried executives.
I'll show you.

82
00:07:30,653 --> 00:07:33,565
No, that will be fine.
Thank you, goodbye.

83
00:07:34,893 --> 00:07:37,851
-Hello.
-How's my big, important executive?

84
00:07:38,053 --> 00:07:42,843
Oh, Marge. Every woman I interview
makes kissy faces at me.

85
00:07:43,253 --> 00:07:45,721
Hello, Mr. Simpson. I'm Karl.

86
00:07:46,053 --> 00:07:48,487
-Hire him.
-I'll call you back.

87
00:07:48,693 --> 00:07:51,605
Meeting in the board room
tomorrow at 2.

88
00:07:51,813 --> 00:07:54,691
-Sit there and keep your mouth shut.
-Yes.

89
00:07:54,893 --> 00:07:56,451
He thinks he's so big.

90
00:07:56,653 --> 00:08:00,566
You don't belong here.
You don't belong here.

91
00:08:01,093 --> 00:08:04,802
You're a fraud and a phony,
and they'll find you out.

92
00:08:05,013 --> 00:08:06,526
-Who told you?
-You did.

93
00:08:06,733 --> 00:08:10,009
With the way you talk
into your chest...

94
00:08:10,213 --> 00:08:13,967
...the way you smother
yourself in lime-green polyester.

95
00:08:14,213 --> 00:08:17,762
I want you to say to
yourself, "I deserve this.

96
00:08:18,013 --> 00:08:21,483
I love it.
I am nature's greatest miracle."

97
00:08:21,733 --> 00:08:23,052
Go ahead, say it.

98
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:24,925
Trust me, Homer.

99
00:08:25,173 --> 00:08:27,607
-Say it!
-I deserve it.

100
00:08:27,853 --> 00:08:29,081
-Louder.
-I deserve it!

101
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:32,643
-Shout it.
-I am nature's greatest miracle!

102
00:08:32,893 --> 00:08:36,169
-Three weeks' vacation plus expenses.
-You got it!

103
00:08:36,373 --> 00:08:39,046
Let's go shopping.

104
00:08:44,173 --> 00:08:45,811
Beauty.

105
00:08:46,013 --> 00:08:48,652
A man's suit should
make him a prince.

106
00:08:48,853 --> 00:08:50,491
It should cry out:

107
00:08:50,693 --> 00:08:53,207
"Here I am. Don't judge me,
love me."

108
00:08:53,493 --> 00:08:56,246
-Do any of these suits do that?
-No.

109
00:08:57,893 --> 00:08:59,246
I like this.

110
00:08:59,573 --> 00:09:04,442
No, no. Stand naturally, Mr. Simpson.
Let it all hang out.

111
00:09:05,013 --> 00:09:06,685
You, conceal it.

112
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:15,085
-Mom and Dad have been kissing.
-Gotta run.

113
00:09:15,373 --> 00:09:19,685
-Happy anniversary, Homer.
-Our anniversary, are you sure?

114
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:23,283
Don't worry, this year you
have an excuse.

115
00:09:23,493 --> 00:09:26,565
-With your job and--
-Happy anniversary.

116
00:09:38,213 --> 00:09:39,168
Homer!

117
00:09:39,733 --> 00:09:42,531
-Hello?
-Mr. Simpson, it's Karl.

118
00:09:42,893 --> 00:09:46,044
Sounds like everything's arrived.
Wonderful.

119
00:09:46,373 --> 00:09:49,445
-You did this?
-I didn't overstep my bounds?

120
00:09:55,533 --> 00:10:00,288
-I love you, Homer!
-I love you, Karl-- Marge.

121
00:10:00,493 --> 00:10:04,247
-Proceed, Smithers.
-Our first issue is low productivity...

122
00:10:04,493 --> 00:10:08,168
-...and high accident rate.
-Any suggestions?

123
00:10:08,373 --> 00:10:11,888
-A round of layoffs.
-Caffeine in the water cooler.

124
00:10:12,093 --> 00:10:15,130
Those are my ideas.
You people don't think!

125
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:18,086
I promoted someone in touch
with workers.

126
00:10:18,293 --> 00:10:19,726
-You!
-You mean him.

127
00:10:19,933 --> 00:10:22,970
You. How would you
improve the situation?

128
00:10:23,293 --> 00:10:25,568
Well, sir, for one thing...

129
00:10:25,773 --> 00:10:29,129
...we had a problem with
fish sticks at lunch.

130
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:35,010
-What are you talking about?
-They chop up the fish into sticks--

131
00:10:35,213 --> 00:10:38,444
I know what they are!
Get to the point.

132
00:10:38,653 --> 00:10:42,692
You only get this tiny cup of sauce,
and I always run out.

133
00:10:43,013 --> 00:10:45,288
-Stop wasting our time.
-Shut up!

134
00:10:45,493 --> 00:10:48,690
Can't you see?
A happy worker is a busy worker.

135
00:10:48,893 --> 00:10:52,488
Three cents' worth of sauce could
save us hours in labor.

136
00:10:52,773 --> 00:10:55,048
I like the cut of your jib.

137
00:10:55,293 --> 00:10:58,729
Let the fools have their tartar sauce.

138
00:10:59,213 --> 00:11:01,647
Enjoy your tartar sauce, boys.

139
00:11:01,853 --> 00:11:06,244
Give me your plate. Don't crowd.
Plenty for everybody!

140
00:11:08,173 --> 00:11:09,162
Brilliant!

141
00:11:09,373 --> 00:11:13,685
Who could've imagined that
reforms would pay off so quickly?

142
00:11:14,653 --> 00:11:19,204
Accidents decreased by the number
Simpson is known to have caused.

143
00:11:19,413 --> 00:11:22,485
Output is just as
high during his last holiday.

144
00:11:22,693 --> 00:11:27,323
My dear, tired old Smithers.
Do I detect a note of jealousy?

145
00:11:28,533 --> 00:11:31,570
It is time.
Give Simpson...

146
00:11:31,773 --> 00:11:32,922
...the key.

147
00:11:33,213 --> 00:11:36,523
Don't sit on that filthy
thing one second longer.

148
00:11:36,733 --> 00:11:39,293
They've given you the key.

149
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:41,603
The key!

150
00:11:58,733 --> 00:12:03,249
Stunning. Absolutely stunning.

151
00:12:04,973 --> 00:12:11,242
I was watching the DuMont last night
and I caught a documentary on Rommel.

152
00:12:11,453 --> 00:12:14,525
A man who got things done.
Towel, Simpson.

153
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:16,610
-Allow me.
-I said Simpson.

154
00:12:17,133 --> 00:12:19,647
Sure thing, Mr. Burns.

155
00:12:19,853 --> 00:12:22,925
Well done, Simpson.
Now, walk behind me.

156
00:12:23,133 --> 00:12:24,452
Can do, sir.

157
00:12:53,533 --> 00:12:58,049
" $1000. Dimoxinil.
To keep brain from freezing."

158
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:01,052
Now I've got you, Simpson.

159
00:13:05,733 --> 00:13:10,568
Between your hair care and wardrobe,
we're not saving for a rainy day.

160
00:13:10,773 --> 00:13:13,571
Rainy day? There's never
gonna be one.

161
00:13:13,773 --> 00:13:17,925
There's not a cloud in the sky.
What does my little girl want?

162
00:13:18,133 --> 00:13:21,523
An absence of mood swings
and stability in my life.

163
00:13:21,933 --> 00:13:23,605
-How about a pony?
-Okay!

164
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:27,848
I want you to weave your
magic with my executives.

165
00:13:28,093 --> 00:13:31,051
-A short speech, "Work. Work. Work."
-Okay.

166
00:13:31,293 --> 00:13:34,444
Excellent. Set you
to your task, Simpson.

167
00:13:36,533 --> 00:13:38,489
It's my sad duty to report...

168
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:42,003
...an executive has
bilked you out of $1000.

169
00:13:42,213 --> 00:13:45,091
What? Blast his hide to Hades!

170
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:48,848
And I was going to buy
that ivory backscratcher.

171
00:13:49,053 --> 00:13:51,283
-How?
-He charged Dimoxinil.

172
00:13:51,493 --> 00:13:54,405
-It's a baldness cure.
-Thank you, professor.

173
00:13:54,613 --> 00:13:58,811
I know what it is.
Make an example of this hooligan.

174
00:13:59,093 --> 00:14:00,651
With pleasure, sir.

175
00:14:01,533 --> 00:14:06,084
You've got to help me. Mr. Burns
wants me to make a speech.

176
00:14:06,293 --> 00:14:09,968
-What do you want?
-I came by to tell you you're fired.

177
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:14,008
Our company doesn't look kindly upon
insurance fraud.

178
00:14:14,213 --> 00:14:16,249
Clean out your desk by noon.

179
00:14:16,613 --> 00:14:20,652
Wait, Mr. Smithers. Homer Simpson
is innocent. I did this.

180
00:14:20,853 --> 00:14:22,525
What are you saying?

181
00:14:22,733 --> 00:14:26,726
Mr. Simpson was unaware.
I take full responsibility.

182
00:14:27,013 --> 00:14:31,689
Really? Well then, you're fired.
Whoever you are.

183
00:14:31,933 --> 00:14:34,049
Here's your $1000.

184
00:14:34,653 --> 00:14:40,523
-What do you care if this guy's bald?
-My reasons are my own.

185
00:14:40,893 --> 00:14:43,851
Karl, you saved me. Why?

186
00:14:44,053 --> 00:14:48,171
Have I done something extraordinary
here today? No.

187
00:14:48,413 --> 00:14:54,488
I did what any soldier would do when
a grenade threatens his commander.

188
00:14:54,733 --> 00:14:58,885
I threw myself upon it and bore its
terrible brunt.

189
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:02,962
Thanks, Karl.
I don't know what to say.

190
00:15:03,213 --> 00:15:05,249
Just walk me to my car.

191
00:15:06,853 --> 00:15:11,643
-Bye, Karl. I'm gonna miss you.
-Bye, Mr. Simpson.

192
00:15:15,533 --> 00:15:19,685
-Did you bring an umbrella today?
-D'oh! No.

193
00:15:19,933 --> 00:15:21,002
Here.

194
00:15:30,413 --> 00:15:34,088
You're broke. You don't have Karl.
He's not here.

195
00:15:34,293 --> 00:15:36,011
But you've got your hair.

196
00:15:36,213 --> 00:15:37,885
Oh, that big speech!

197
00:15:49,613 --> 00:15:52,446
-Hey, what's happening, hepcats?
-No way.

198
00:15:52,773 --> 00:15:54,650
It's gotta be a fake.

199
00:15:55,133 --> 00:15:57,647
It's like reals-ville, daddy-o.

200
00:16:02,453 --> 00:16:03,772
What are you doing?

201
00:16:06,053 --> 00:16:07,168
You little--!

202
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:11,449
Now I've got you!

203
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:13,891
Boy must die!

204
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:16,289
I love you, Dad.

205
00:16:17,653 --> 00:16:19,689
Dirty trick. I won't kill you.

206
00:16:19,933 --> 00:16:24,290
But I'll tell you three
things that will haunt you forever.

207
00:16:24,533 --> 00:16:29,687
You've ruined me, you've crippled your
family and baldness is hereditary!

208
00:16:29,893 --> 00:16:31,292
It is?

209
00:16:36,053 --> 00:16:40,285
-Why don't you call the pharmacy?
-I don't have $1000!

210
00:16:40,493 --> 00:16:43,883
But you do.
You've been squirreling it away.

211
00:16:44,093 --> 00:16:46,368
Saving it for a rainy day, right?

212
00:16:49,893 --> 00:16:53,249
Dad's taking this in a
less than heroic fashion.

213
00:17:03,533 --> 00:17:06,650
Oh, Homie. I'm so sorry.

214
00:17:08,213 --> 00:17:12,889
Got that speech in five minutes.
You're not going to hang yourself?

215
00:17:17,653 --> 00:17:19,052
Dear Mr. Simpson...

216
00:17:19,253 --> 00:17:22,962
...I've prepared your speech
on 3-by-5 cards.

217
00:17:23,173 --> 00:17:26,848
-The big words are spelled phonetically.
-"Phonetically."

218
00:17:27,053 --> 00:17:31,968
God bless you. You are one of
Springfield's special creatures.

219
00:17:32,933 --> 00:17:37,051
Your obedient servant, Karl.
Good luck, sir.

220
00:17:37,253 --> 00:17:40,086
That wasn't just a voice
inside my head.

221
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:43,729
-Why are you here?
-I came to say bye to the gals.

222
00:17:43,933 --> 00:17:48,131
Thanks for the speech.
But I can't give it. Look at me.

223
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,893
-I haven't taught you anything!
-What?

224
00:17:51,093 --> 00:17:55,325
The tartar sauce, the bathroom key,
drying your boss's hands.

225
00:17:55,533 --> 00:18:00,049
It was never the hair. You did it,
because you believed you could.

226
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,642
-I'm a big fool.
-No, you're not.

227
00:18:02,853 --> 00:18:07,244
-How do you know?
-Mother taught me never to kiss a fool.

228
00:18:07,533 --> 00:18:10,843
-Karl.
-Now go get them, tiger.

229
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:18,048
And now with some insights, one
of the stars of our nuclear family...

230
00:18:18,533 --> 00:18:19,682
...Homer Simpson.

231
00:18:22,013 --> 00:18:26,086
Who is that old geezer?
What's he done with Homer Simpson?

232
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,449
He is Homer Simpson, sir.

233
00:18:29,933 --> 00:18:32,686
You'd think I was crazy if I did this.

234
00:18:32,933 --> 00:18:36,687
-He's crazy!
-Yet this company does this every day.

235
00:18:36,893 --> 00:18:40,169
Bloated inventory,
outmoded production methods.

236
00:18:40,373 --> 00:18:43,604
I can save this company millions
a year. How?

237
00:18:43,813 --> 00:18:46,771
Jiko Kanri, the art
of self-management.

238
00:18:47,133 --> 00:18:51,285
-This bald man has no ideas.
-lf it's a joke, I'm not laughing.

239
00:18:51,493 --> 00:18:55,008
Telling us how to run things.
He doesn't have hair.

240
00:18:55,213 --> 00:18:59,286
Mining uranium that could be
purchased on foreign markets.

241
00:18:59,533 --> 00:19:02,809
The long-term benefits more than...

242
00:19:03,013 --> 00:19:07,245
...offsetting the one-time cost,
for a net savings of $5--

243
00:19:07,493 --> 00:19:09,085
Lots of money.

244
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,847
Mr. Burns' office, right now.

245
00:19:14,493 --> 00:19:16,131
Dead man coming through.

246
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:20,690
Well, well. Our dashing, young
junior executive.

247
00:19:20,933 --> 00:19:25,848
You made a mockery of our meeting.
I should fire you on the spot!

248
00:19:26,213 --> 00:19:29,967
-But I'm not going to.
-Why?

249
00:19:30,213 --> 00:19:33,967
-How old do you think I am?
-I don't know. 102?

250
00:19:34,293 --> 00:19:36,170
I'm only 81.

251
00:19:36,413 --> 00:19:40,964
You may find this hard
to believe, but in my salad days...

252
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:45,286
...my glory was a bright
shock of strawberry blond curls.

253
00:19:45,533 --> 00:19:49,162
I was big man on campus until
my senior year...

254
00:19:49,373 --> 00:19:52,285
...when I became as bald
as a plucked chicken.

255
00:19:52,493 --> 00:19:57,203
I too know the sting
of male pattern baldness.

256
00:19:57,933 --> 00:20:00,845
That's why I'm giving you
your old job back.

257
00:20:01,173 --> 00:20:03,289
What? Oh, thank you.

258
00:20:03,813 --> 00:20:06,327
Get out of here before I reconsider.

259
00:20:06,533 --> 00:20:07,886
Better hurry up.

260
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:15,485
-Are you still awake?
-I've never been more awake in my life.

261
00:20:15,693 --> 00:20:17,843
-What's wrong?
-Are you kidding?

262
00:20:18,053 --> 00:20:22,331
I'm stuck in a dead-end job again.
The kids will hate me...

263
00:20:22,533 --> 00:20:25,650
...because I can't buy the stuff
I promised.

264
00:20:25,853 --> 00:20:30,244
And you're not going to love
me because I'm ugly and bald.

265
00:20:30,453 --> 00:20:34,685
Oh, Homer. Your job has always put
food on our table.

266
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:39,848
-And the kids will get over it.
-And? What about loving me?

267
00:20:40,213 --> 00:20:43,489
-Oh, Homer. Come here.
-What?

268
00:20:43,733 --> 00:20:45,564
Come here.
