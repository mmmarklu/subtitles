1
00:00:07,573 --> 00:00:09,848
War Of The Simpsons

2
00:01:19,173 --> 00:01:21,687
Mmm!
"Hors doovers."

3
00:01:21,933 --> 00:01:26,449
-Homer! You promised.
-That I wouldn't eat? Never. You lie.

4
00:01:26,693 --> 00:01:29,161
Please! We've never thrown a party.

5
00:01:29,413 --> 00:01:32,052
We'll pay back those
who invited us to their homes.

6
00:01:32,293 --> 00:01:35,126
What about that bash
with champagne...

7
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:37,449
...and musicians and holy men?

8
00:01:37,653 --> 00:01:39,644
-That was our wedding!
-Oh.

9
00:01:39,853 --> 00:01:41,286
It's time for bed.

10
00:01:41,493 --> 00:01:45,611
-I want to hear your witty banter.
-You can't have fun in bed.

11
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:49,643
Oh, son, when you're older,
you'll know better.

12
00:01:51,933 --> 00:01:55,721
Oh, baby.
Mmm! Yeah.

13
00:01:56,293 --> 00:01:58,488
-They're here!
-How do I look?

14
00:01:58,693 --> 00:02:00,365
-Glasses?
-Gag ice cubes?

15
00:02:00,613 --> 00:02:03,207
-Put a record on.
-What are their names?

16
00:02:05,173 --> 00:02:06,845
-Hi.
-Please come in.

17
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:11,086
You look swell. And the house!
You've done.... Whatever!

18
00:02:11,293 --> 00:02:15,525
Anybody mind if I serve as bartender?
I have a Ph.D. in mixology.

19
00:02:15,733 --> 00:02:17,451
College boy.

20
00:02:17,693 --> 00:02:20,605
Care to try my
Flanders planter's punch?

21
00:02:20,813 --> 00:02:22,849
Why not? I paid for it.

22
00:02:26,133 --> 00:02:28,886
Next time put a little alcohol in it.

23
00:02:29,093 --> 00:02:32,369
It has three shots of rum,
a jigger of bourbon...

24
00:02:32,613 --> 00:02:35,810
...and a little
crème de cassis for flavor.

25
00:02:36,013 --> 00:02:41,326
Well, I do have a warm sense of
well-being, and I'm slurring my words.

26
00:02:41,533 --> 00:02:44,684
-Give me another.
-Go easy on the alcohol.

27
00:02:44,893 --> 00:02:48,090
Remember when you threw up
in the laundry hamper?

28
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:49,846
No.

29
00:02:55,253 --> 00:02:59,769
Hi! You're Homer's sister-in-law,
right? I remember you.

30
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:03,847
But I don't remember you
being so beautiful.

31
00:03:07,613 --> 00:03:10,002
A new kind of Mace?
Really painful.

32
00:03:10,213 --> 00:03:13,046
Oh, Dr. Hibbert.
Enjoying the party?

33
00:03:13,253 --> 00:03:17,690
Not really. Someone slipped
one of those novelty ice cubes...

34
00:03:17,893 --> 00:03:20,646
...with a fake fly in my drink.

35
00:03:22,173 --> 00:03:24,243
-You fell for it!
-Homer...

36
00:03:24,493 --> 00:03:28,042
...these ice cubes are made from
highly toxic chemicals.

37
00:03:28,293 --> 00:03:30,648
A real fly is more sanitary.

38
00:03:30,893 --> 00:03:33,930
The look on your face.
It's priceless!

39
00:03:38,773 --> 00:03:40,650
-Bart! Come here.
-What?

40
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:44,243
-You're a little monkey, aren't you?
-Yes, sir.

41
00:03:44,493 --> 00:03:47,132
-Do that cute thing you do.
-What?

42
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:50,643
-That thing you know how to do.
-What?

43
00:03:51,053 --> 00:03:52,122
Go to bed.

44
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:53,482
Everybody!

45
00:03:54,053 --> 00:03:58,126
Look! I'm the funniest guy
in the world!

46
00:03:58,893 --> 00:04:01,453
Oh, Homer! You're the king.

47
00:04:14,173 --> 00:04:17,245
I've been wanting to tell
you off for years...

48
00:04:17,453 --> 00:04:19,489
...but I never had the nerve.

49
00:04:19,733 --> 00:04:23,089
I don't know you. Our wives
are friends. We just met.

50
00:04:23,293 --> 00:04:24,885
You stink!

51
00:04:25,093 --> 00:04:29,962
You and your whole lousy
operation stinks. I quit!

52
00:04:30,573 --> 00:04:32,370
-Gee, don't quit.
-All right.

53
00:04:35,493 --> 00:04:36,767
Could you...

54
00:04:37,013 --> 00:04:38,446
...give me a...

55
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:41,645
-...handful of peanuts, Maude?
-Oh, sure.

56
00:04:41,853 --> 00:04:43,366
Not those peanuts.

57
00:04:43,573 --> 00:04:46,849
-The ones at the bottom.
-Oh, okay.

58
00:04:52,173 --> 00:04:55,085
Thanks for inviting me.
I had a great time.

59
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,244
I apologize for my husband.

60
00:04:57,493 --> 00:05:01,281
If you want him to live,
roll him onto his stomach.

61
00:05:01,493 --> 00:05:03,643
Thanks, I will, Dr. Hibbert.

62
00:05:03,853 --> 00:05:06,447
Remember, I said "if."

63
00:05:11,213 --> 00:05:14,842
I have never been so embarrassed
in my life!

64
00:05:15,053 --> 00:05:17,442
Why? What did you do?

65
00:05:27,693 --> 00:05:29,206
Marge!

66
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:30,482
Come here.

67
00:05:30,733 --> 00:05:33,452
-Where are we going?
-Shh!

68
00:05:34,013 --> 00:05:38,803
I don't want the kids to hear. I
always hated hearing my parents fight.

69
00:05:39,013 --> 00:05:43,450
-They're fighting again.
-That music gives me the chills.

70
00:05:43,653 --> 00:05:46,884
Do you remember the way you acted
at the party?

71
00:05:47,093 --> 00:05:48,651
The way I acted?

72
00:05:48,853 --> 00:05:52,243
I must get out of these wet
clothes and into a dry martini.

73
00:05:52,453 --> 00:05:54,523
-Well said.
-Thank you.

74
00:05:54,733 --> 00:05:56,451
-A fly!
-I put it there.

75
00:05:56,653 --> 00:05:59,008
-You did?
-I slipped it in.

76
00:05:59,213 --> 00:06:01,568
-Pure hilarity!
-Pure Homer!

77
00:06:01,773 --> 00:06:04,651
The most whimsical jape
of the season.

78
00:06:21,533 --> 00:06:25,651
I like to think that there's
no line you could cross...

79
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:28,287
...that could make me not love you.

80
00:06:28,533 --> 00:06:33,163
But last night, you didn't just cross
that line, you threw up on it.

81
00:06:33,373 --> 00:06:36,046
Can't we just forget it
and go to church?

82
00:06:36,253 --> 00:06:39,768
I'm going alone.
You stay here and explain to Bart...

83
00:06:40,013 --> 00:06:43,767
-...why you scarred him for life.
-No, I didn't! l--

84
00:06:44,013 --> 00:06:46,607
Oh. You mean inside, don't you?

85
00:06:47,053 --> 00:06:52,047
You might have noticed Daddy acting
strange and probably don't know why.

86
00:06:52,293 --> 00:06:56,571
-You were wasted.
-I didn't know when to say when.

87
00:06:56,813 --> 00:06:59,646
I just hope you didn't lose
respect for me.

88
00:06:59,893 --> 00:07:04,284
I have as much respect for you
as I ever did or ever will.

89
00:07:04,493 --> 00:07:07,610
Before a preview
of next week's sermon...

90
00:07:07,813 --> 00:07:12,568
...I have some announcements to make.
We have some new pamphlets...

91
00:07:12,773 --> 00:07:15,082
...including "Satan's Boners"...

92
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:18,245
..."Good Grief,
More Satan's Boners, " and...

93
00:07:18,453 --> 00:07:21,445
...for teens, "It's Not Cool To
Fry In Hell."

94
00:07:21,773 --> 00:07:24,048
Marge? Marge?

95
00:07:25,613 --> 00:07:29,049
The Lord and I can't compete
with the squeaking...

96
00:07:29,293 --> 00:07:33,002
...of Homer's shoes. Why don't we
wait until he sits?

97
00:07:33,213 --> 00:07:34,771
-Sorry.
-Sit down.

98
00:07:34,973 --> 00:07:38,648
We will be holding our
third annual marriage retreat...

99
00:07:38,853 --> 00:07:40,730
...at Catfish Lake.

100
00:07:40,933 --> 00:07:45,449
Counseling for couples whose
marriages are hanging by a thread...

101
00:07:45,693 --> 00:07:48,924
...or those in need of a tune-up.
To participate...

102
00:07:49,173 --> 00:07:51,687
...please sign up in the lobby.

103
00:07:53,293 --> 00:07:55,648
Will the Simpsons be attending?

104
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:59,568
Oh, well. It's very tempting.
A wonderful idea--

105
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:03,362
Marge! What are you doing?
Are you insane?!

106
00:08:03,613 --> 00:08:05,331
Give me that pencil!

107
00:08:05,533 --> 00:08:07,285
-We'll be there.
-D'oh!

108
00:08:10,053 --> 00:08:12,283
Marriage encounter,
here I come!

109
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:16,042
-You want to go?
-They're holding it at Catfish Lake.

110
00:08:16,253 --> 00:08:20,610
They couldn't call it that
if it didn't have a catfish in it.

111
00:08:20,813 --> 00:08:25,011
We're going to give our marriage
a tune-up. No fishing.

112
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:28,125
That's the babysitter.
I'm Mrs. Simpson.

113
00:08:28,373 --> 00:08:31,206
Simpson? Simpson?

114
00:08:31,813 --> 00:08:33,849
Come back for more, eh?

115
00:08:45,253 --> 00:08:46,368
No! What--?

116
00:08:46,573 --> 00:08:49,770
Where are we supposed to get a sitter?

117
00:08:49,973 --> 00:08:55,252
If we can't find a babysitter, we
can't go! What a kick in the teeth.

118
00:08:55,453 --> 00:08:58,525
Why do you need a sitter?
I'm 10 1/2!

119
00:08:58,773 --> 00:08:59,649
Mom! No.

120
00:08:59,893 --> 00:09:02,885
-I'll give you a taste of me hand.
-No!

121
00:09:03,093 --> 00:09:05,323
-Grampa?
-Hey! Who? What?

122
00:09:05,573 --> 00:09:08,690
-Could you do something?
-I can dress myself.

123
00:09:09,293 --> 00:09:12,569
Could you babysit
the kids this weekend?

124
00:09:12,813 --> 00:09:16,044
-I wouldn't ask, except I'm desperate.
-Sure.

125
00:09:16,253 --> 00:09:19,086
Last resort. Old Grampa, the feeb.

126
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:23,451
The guy who can't be counted on
for nothing, nohow.

127
00:09:23,693 --> 00:09:26,253
Everyone's against me.

128
00:09:26,453 --> 00:09:27,602
I'll do it.

129
00:09:27,813 --> 00:09:30,452
Just putting a few things
in the trunk.

130
00:09:32,133 --> 00:09:34,249
If Maggie gets sick,
call here.

131
00:09:34,493 --> 00:09:37,087
If she sticks her finger
in a socket, here.

132
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:38,971
If she drinks cleanser--

133
00:09:39,213 --> 00:09:42,762
-Give me the list! I can read.
-All right. Goodbye.

134
00:09:43,013 --> 00:09:45,243
And behave yourselves.

135
00:09:48,093 --> 00:09:51,005
-Call this number if he falls.
-I heard that!

136
00:09:51,213 --> 00:09:52,248
Bye, Dad, Mom!

137
00:09:52,493 --> 00:09:55,246
Grampa, Mom forgot to give you this.

138
00:09:55,493 --> 00:09:59,452
It's a list of the things Lisa
and I can and can't do.

139
00:10:01,253 --> 00:10:03,209
You can smoke cigars?

140
00:10:06,693 --> 00:10:08,809
Mmm, bait!

141
00:10:11,093 --> 00:10:13,243
Better get some gas.

142
00:10:14,533 --> 00:10:18,048
Fill her up.
I guess I'll go stretch my legs.

143
00:10:21,093 --> 00:10:22,845
-Where to?
-Catfish Lake.

144
00:10:23,053 --> 00:10:26,966
-After General Sherman?
-Who's General Sherman?

145
00:10:27,213 --> 00:10:31,172
The biggest catfish around.
Weighs over 500 pounds.

146
00:10:31,413 --> 00:10:33,244
-Who says that?
-They do.

147
00:10:33,453 --> 00:10:34,852
Oh.

148
00:10:35,613 --> 00:10:39,083
That's the only picture of him.
Can't see what he is.

149
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,244
He's freakishly big, though.

150
00:10:41,613 --> 00:10:46,243
Gentlemen, I am going to catch
General Sherman.

151
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:47,802
Oh, my!

152
00:10:48,013 --> 00:10:51,050
We'll go to the video store,
grab a burger...

153
00:10:51,293 --> 00:10:53,443
...and head for the arcade.

154
00:10:53,813 --> 00:10:56,168
Grampa's an old man
who trusts us.

155
00:10:56,413 --> 00:11:00,884
-Is it right to take advantage of him?
-In these crazy times...

156
00:11:01,133 --> 00:11:04,921
...who knows what's right
or wrong? My gut's telling me:

157
00:11:05,133 --> 00:11:06,043
Bleed Gramps dry.

158
00:11:06,493 --> 00:11:08,449
Mr. and Mrs. Simpson.
Welcome.

159
00:11:08,653 --> 00:11:11,247
Hello.
We're glad we could come.

160
00:11:11,453 --> 00:11:12,886
-Hi, Helen.
-Hi.

161
00:11:13,133 --> 00:11:16,842
Homer. Here to give your
marriage a little spit shine?

162
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:19,732
None of your business.
Say, Reverend...

163
00:11:19,973 --> 00:11:23,443
-...are we gonna do any fishing?
-Oh, I'm afraid not.

164
00:11:23,653 --> 00:11:28,443
A marriage can't be reconciled
in a few hours. It takes a weekend.

165
00:11:28,693 --> 00:11:32,891
Bait our hooks with honesty.
That way a happy marriage...

166
00:11:33,133 --> 00:11:35,044
-...won't get away.
-I see.

167
00:11:35,293 --> 00:11:37,488
I also understand bowling.

168
00:11:37,693 --> 00:11:43,165
Our best turnout yet. Why doesn't
everyone introduce themselves and...

169
00:11:43,413 --> 00:11:46,450
...tell us why they're here?
John? Gloria?

170
00:11:46,693 --> 00:11:49,844
My name's Gloria.
I'm here because Johnny...

171
00:11:50,053 --> 00:11:53,568
...hasn't been able to
cut it, manwise, for some time.

172
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:58,045
Not that I'd want his odor of
sour defeat pressed against me.

173
00:11:58,293 --> 00:12:00,284
-That's enough!
-Thank you.

174
00:12:00,533 --> 00:12:03,411
Why don't you tell us
about why you're here?

175
00:12:03,613 --> 00:12:06,525
She keeps a filthy house
and talks profanely.

176
00:12:06,773 --> 00:12:10,049
-She's the Queen of the Harpies!
-No, I'm not.

177
00:12:10,253 --> 00:12:14,007
-Here's your crown, Your Majesty!
-Get away from me!

178
00:12:14,213 --> 00:12:19,412
You've come to the right place.
First, look into each others' eyes.

179
00:12:22,053 --> 00:12:25,125
Your eyes! I forgot
how beautiful they are.

180
00:12:25,373 --> 00:12:27,523
-Let's never fight.
-We were fools.

181
00:12:27,733 --> 00:12:30,088
-Let's not talk about that.
-Let's not talk at all!

182
00:12:30,293 --> 00:12:34,844
Remember my saving your lives
when we pass the collection plate.

183
00:12:35,133 --> 00:12:38,091
All right.
Ned, Maude, what brings you here?

184
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:40,164
-Well....
-Go on, Neddie.

185
00:12:40,413 --> 00:12:43,883
Sometimes Maude underlines
passages in my Bible...

186
00:12:44,133 --> 00:12:47,887
-...because she can't find hers.
-Lucky you don't keep guns.

187
00:12:48,093 --> 00:12:50,368
-Homer, why are you here?
-Oh....

188
00:12:50,613 --> 00:12:53,650
-Because I looked down her dress.
-No, no.

189
00:12:53,853 --> 00:12:57,687
Marge will tell us all your faults.
Tell us about hers.

190
00:12:57,893 --> 00:13:00,646
-She's perfect.
-What are her faults?

191
00:13:00,893 --> 00:13:02,849
-It can be annoying.
-Homer....

192
00:13:03,093 --> 00:13:05,323
-You'll get your turn.
-I'm done.

193
00:13:05,573 --> 00:13:06,767
Okay. Marge.

194
00:13:06,973 --> 00:13:08,042
Well....

195
00:13:08,293 --> 00:13:13,003
It's not that I don't love the guy.
I'm always sticking up for him.

196
00:13:13,213 --> 00:13:16,285
-It's just that he's self-centered.
-Wait!

197
00:13:16,493 --> 00:13:17,562
Now, Homer.

198
00:13:17,773 --> 00:13:21,652
He forgets birthdays,
anniversaries, holidays.

199
00:13:21,893 --> 00:13:24,691
He chews with his mouth open,
he gambles.

200
00:13:24,893 --> 00:13:27,965
He hangs out at a seedy bar
with lowlifes.

201
00:13:28,213 --> 00:13:31,091
-It's true. It's all true.
-Don't interrupt.

202
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:34,245
He blows his nose on towels
and puts them back.

203
00:13:34,493 --> 00:13:36,324
Only a couple of times.

204
00:13:37,533 --> 00:13:39,842
Chocolate,
chocolate brownie fudge.

205
00:13:40,093 --> 00:13:42,482
-Chocolate-chocolate chip.
-Check.

206
00:13:42,693 --> 00:13:46,402
-Did she really write that list?
-What a question!

207
00:13:46,613 --> 00:13:47,966
-Next?
-Syrup.

208
00:13:48,213 --> 00:13:51,410
-Aisle six.
-All right. But put out that cigar.

209
00:13:51,613 --> 00:13:56,164
He drinks out of the carton.
He never changes the baby.

210
00:13:56,413 --> 00:13:58,973
When he sleeps he makes
chewing noises.

211
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:02,489
And when he wakes up
he makes honking noises.

212
00:14:02,693 --> 00:14:07,084
Oh, and he scratches himself
with his keys. I guess that's it.

213
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:12,361
Wait. He kicks me in his sleep and
his toenails are long and yellow.

214
00:14:12,613 --> 00:14:15,571
That's all I can think of.
You're all tired.

215
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:19,772
I want to thank you for letting me
get it off my chest.

216
00:14:19,973 --> 00:14:22,692
We missed the luau.
Let's call it a night.

217
00:14:22,893 --> 00:14:27,205
But I can't avenge my partner's
death with this peashooter.

218
00:14:27,413 --> 00:14:30,450
That cannon of yours
is against regulations!

219
00:14:30,693 --> 00:14:33,651
In this department
we go by the book.

220
00:14:35,093 --> 00:14:37,049
-Bye, book.
-All right!

221
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,851
Kids, it's late.

222
00:14:39,093 --> 00:14:42,369
You should go to bed.
We've had a big day.

223
00:14:42,573 --> 00:14:44,768
Wise guy.
Little smart aleck....

224
00:14:45,013 --> 00:14:48,449
I can't kid myself.
I'm having an ethical crisis.

225
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:54,090
Out at 5. Catch Sherman at 5:30.
Clean him at 6.

226
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:59,088
Eat him by 6:30. Back in bed by 7
with no incriminating evidence.

227
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:02,370
-The perfect crime.
-Homer?

228
00:15:02,613 --> 00:15:06,891
You're going fishing?
I can't believe your selfishness.

229
00:15:07,093 --> 00:15:12,247
You can go fishing anytime.
But we're here to save our marriage.

230
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:15,570
You're thinking about fishing
while I'm talking.

231
00:15:15,773 --> 00:15:17,843
-Can I be honest?
-Yes.

232
00:15:18,093 --> 00:15:20,766
You're right, I am!
Help me, Marge.

233
00:15:21,013 --> 00:15:24,483
-What do I do to be a good guy?
-Get back in bed.

234
00:15:24,733 --> 00:15:26,451
All right.

235
00:15:28,493 --> 00:15:32,008
But I can't sleep.
Can I take a walk?

236
00:15:32,213 --> 00:15:33,362
Sure.

237
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:37,689
Gotta be a good husband.
Gotta be a good husband.

238
00:15:37,933 --> 00:15:42,643
Gotta be a good husband. Hey, kid!
You forgot your--

239
00:15:48,853 --> 00:15:50,730
Go ahead, General Sherman!

240
00:15:50,933 --> 00:15:54,482
Waste your strength,
you big, ugly catfish.

241
00:15:54,693 --> 00:15:58,049
I got a skillet and some butter
with your name on it.

242
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,846
Homer?

243
00:16:05,093 --> 00:16:06,651
-Sugar?
-Ten, please.

244
00:16:06,893 --> 00:16:10,442
-Top me off.
-Does your ma let you drink coffee?

245
00:16:10,653 --> 00:16:12,166
For the last time, yes!

246
00:16:12,373 --> 00:16:13,692
Come on, give up!

247
00:16:16,853 --> 00:16:20,926
Big blowout at casa de Simpson.
The only adult is frail.

248
00:16:21,133 --> 00:16:24,250
Bart's joint. Two-ish.
Be there or be square.

249
00:16:24,493 --> 00:16:28,452
Tell my friends? All right.
But I've got some funky friends.

250
00:16:28,693 --> 00:16:32,811
I get out at noon, and I'm
already invited to a party.

251
00:16:33,013 --> 00:16:35,447
Now, this is a trust exercise.

252
00:16:35,653 --> 00:16:39,441
You fall backwards and rely
on your spouse to catch you.

253
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:45,249
-Do I have to do this?
-No.

254
00:16:45,453 --> 00:16:47,444
I wouldn't recommend it.

255
00:16:47,653 --> 00:16:50,406
As a trained marriage counselor...

256
00:16:50,613 --> 00:16:54,970
...this is the first time I've told
a partner they were right.

257
00:16:55,213 --> 00:16:56,692
It's all his fault.

258
00:16:57,133 --> 00:16:59,931
I'm willing to put that
on a certificate.

259
00:17:11,533 --> 00:17:14,889
Okay. You're probably
wondering why I'm still here.

260
00:17:15,133 --> 00:17:18,170
You'll make me
the most famous fisherman ever.

261
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:20,688
Right up there with that...

262
00:17:20,933 --> 00:17:22,685
...the...

263
00:17:22,933 --> 00:17:25,447
...the bald guy in the cable
fishing show.

264
00:17:27,733 --> 00:17:28,722
Holy mackerel!

265
00:17:31,093 --> 00:17:33,004
Good to see you.
What's up?

266
00:17:33,213 --> 00:17:38,048
-Any chicks over 8?
-Not yet, but the afternoon is young.

267
00:17:40,773 --> 00:17:42,525
-What's wrong?
-It's obvious.

268
00:17:42,773 --> 00:17:46,846
We've set back the children's
rights movement for decades.

269
00:17:47,093 --> 00:17:48,492
You're really great.

270
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:52,049
Hey, you! You!
Shut that door! Put that away!

271
00:17:52,293 --> 00:17:54,443
No! Stop! Oh!

272
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:59,847
-You want me to take off my belt?
-Yeah.

273
00:18:00,093 --> 00:18:02,243
All right, I'll show you.

274
00:18:03,053 --> 00:18:04,452
Doggone it!

275
00:18:06,693 --> 00:18:09,571
I love you!
But I must kill you!

276
00:18:14,653 --> 00:18:17,292
Thanks for coming.
Nice tie, Nelson.

277
00:18:17,533 --> 00:18:19,125
It's your dad's.

278
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:23,292
I tried to be a good babysitter,
but I failed.

279
00:18:23,533 --> 00:18:25,091
I'm a feeb.

280
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:28,643
A useless, old, worn out....

281
00:18:31,253 --> 00:18:34,643
I have this unpleasant
feeling I've never had before.

282
00:18:34,853 --> 00:18:38,163
It's remorse, you burlesque
of irrepressible youth.

283
00:18:38,373 --> 00:18:41,445
-How do you make it go away?
-Grab a brush...

284
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:44,645
...and clean faster
than you ever have before.

285
00:19:07,013 --> 00:19:08,446
Hi, honey.

286
00:19:09,493 --> 00:19:12,849
-How's the retreat?
-I thought our marriage...

287
00:19:13,053 --> 00:19:16,648
...was in trouble.
But never this much trouble.

288
00:19:16,853 --> 00:19:19,651
-How can--?
-You don't know what this means.

289
00:19:19,893 --> 00:19:24,250
This fish represents a better life
for us. It makes me a hero.

290
00:19:24,493 --> 00:19:26,927
-To who?
-Those weirdos in the store!

291
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:31,649
-This fish shows how selfish you are!
-Then I'll throw it back!

292
00:19:31,893 --> 00:19:33,531
-Oh, yeah, sure.
-Watch!

293
00:19:36,813 --> 00:19:39,373
Wow! I did it.

294
00:19:39,613 --> 00:19:43,083
I gave up fame and breakfast
for my marriage.

295
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:47,451
I fought it for six hours.
One word and I toss it back.

296
00:19:47,733 --> 00:19:50,725
You're telling me our marriage
is in trouble?

297
00:19:50,973 --> 00:19:54,488
-Come here, baby!
-Oh, Homer.

298
00:20:16,653 --> 00:20:18,564
-We're back!
-How's the marriage?

299
00:20:18,773 --> 00:20:20,764
Same as usual.
Perfectomundo.

300
00:20:20,973 --> 00:20:24,488
The house looks wonderful!
What's your secret?

301
00:20:24,693 --> 00:20:26,649
Pretending to cry.

302
00:20:27,653 --> 00:20:31,771
That's right! You heard me!
Pretending to cry!

303
00:20:31,973 --> 00:20:35,249
I can turn it on
and off like a faucet.

304
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:37,763
"I'm crying. I'm so sad."

305
00:20:37,973 --> 00:20:41,648
-Way to go, Grampa.
-I'll never trust another old person.

306
00:20:41,893 --> 00:20:45,442
I fooled you!
So long, suckers!

00:20:45,853 --> 00:20:50,881
Yep, General Sherman. They say he's
500 pounds of bottom-dwelling fury.

308
00:20:51,133 --> 00:20:55,445
No one knows how old he is,
but if you ask me, he's 100.

309
00:20:55,653 --> 00:20:58,213
-No one's caught him?
-One came close.

310
00:20:58,413 --> 00:21:00,927
His name was Homer.
Seven feet tall.

311
00:21:01,173 --> 00:21:05,246
Arms like tree trunks.
Eyes like steel, cold and hard.

312
00:21:05,453 --> 00:21:08,889
Had a shock of hair, red.
Like the fires of hell.
