1
00:01:23,301 --> 00:01:26,881
-So, what happened in Capital City?
-Oh, Barney.

2
00:01:27,094 --> 00:01:29,251
We're dying of curiosity.

3
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:32,801
The only thing worse
than being a loser...

4
00:01:33,012 --> 00:01:37,338
...is being a guy telling the story
of how he became a loser.

5
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:41,426
-I don't want that to happen to me.
-Please, Homer?

6
00:01:41,639 --> 00:01:42,884
Well, okay.

7
00:01:43,099 --> 00:01:48,635
It was "Nuclear Plant Employee, Spouses
and No-More-Than-Three-Kids Night"...

8
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:51,469
...down at Springfield Stadium.

9
00:01:53,394 --> 00:01:58,099
I think we lost them.
And we're at the ballpark! All right!

10
00:01:58,312 --> 00:02:02,354
Two birds with one stone!
Okay, everybody out!

11
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:10,473
Some of the players you see
may make it to the big leagues.

12
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:15,764
-Will we see washed-up major leaguers?
-Sure, there's a nice mix.

13
00:02:15,984 --> 00:02:20,358
There's no better place to spend
a balmy summers' night.

14
00:02:20,568 --> 00:02:24,610
The grass of the outfield,
the brick of the infield...

15
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:28,861
...and the chalk lines that divide
the man from the boy.

16
00:02:29,071 --> 00:02:33,730
Lisa, you're forgetting the beer.
It comes in 72-ounce tubs.

17
00:02:33,948 --> 00:02:37,362
-Space out the tubs this year.
-What do you mean?

18
00:02:37,573 --> 00:02:41,521
Last year you got rambunctious
and mooned the umpire.

19
00:02:41,742 --> 00:02:45,108
Marge, this ticket
doesn't just give me a seat.

20
00:02:45,326 --> 00:02:51,858
It also gives me the right, no, the duty
to make a complete ass of myself.

21
00:02:52,078 --> 00:02:54,746
The Gammills! Good to see you.

22
00:02:54,954 --> 00:02:58,403
You're an inspiration to us
in Waste Management.

23
00:02:58,622 --> 00:03:03,364
Forget about contaminants
for one night and have a hot dog.

24
00:03:03,582 --> 00:03:07,742
-Put a smile on his card, Smithers.
-Already there, sir.

25
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:12,578
-The Simpsons, sir.
-Well, if it isn't the Simps.

26
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:15,543
Oh, the Simpsons, sir.

27
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:19,079
Oh, yes. Homer and Marge Simpson.

28
00:03:19,295 --> 00:03:23,290
Oh, and these must be Bart,
Lisa and Expecting.

29
00:03:23,504 --> 00:03:26,373
The card needs to be updated, sir.

30
00:03:26,588 --> 00:03:30,500
That's okay. The baby's name
isn't important. Let's go.

31
00:03:30,715 --> 00:03:34,212
Red Hots! Get your Red Hots here!

32
00:03:38,467 --> 00:03:42,592
Flash Bailor! I gotta get
his autograph. He was a star.

33
00:03:42,802 --> 00:03:45,255
-Will you sign my ball?
-No.

34
00:03:45,886 --> 00:03:49,548
Lousy, washed-up,
broken-down tub of guts!

35
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:52,429
-Who does he think he is?
-What's wrong?

36
00:03:52,638 --> 00:03:56,005
-He won't sign my ball.
-He's a fine role model.

37
00:03:56,222 --> 00:03:58,759
Bart, give me that ball.

38
00:03:58,973 --> 00:04:01,806
Check out the mature quail
heading over.

39
00:04:02,016 --> 00:04:05,134
Little lady,
what can Flash do for you?

40
00:04:05,934 --> 00:04:07,392
Here you go, Bart.

41
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:13,220
"Springfield Kozy Kort Motel, Room 26.
How about it? Flash."

42
00:04:13,436 --> 00:04:17,218
Wow, Flash Bailor came on to my wife!

43
00:04:17,437 --> 00:04:20,353
You've still got the magic, Marge.

44
00:04:20,564 --> 00:04:23,764
Hey, Dad, look!
You're on Jumbo-Vision!

45
00:04:23,981 --> 00:04:26,470
Hey, everybody! How you doing?

46
00:04:26,691 --> 00:04:31,313
Look at me! I'm Homer Simpson!

47
00:04:32,442 --> 00:04:35,358
Homer. Homer! X-Y-Z.

48
00:04:35,568 --> 00:04:37,772
Examine my zipper? Why?

49
00:04:39,902 --> 00:04:44,442
-Thanks, everybody.
-Throwing out tonight's first ball...

50
00:04:44,654 --> 00:04:49,229
...the man whose name is synonymous
with the safest energy source:

51
00:04:49,447 --> 00:04:52,778
Mr. Montgomery Burns!

52
00:04:53,949 --> 00:04:56,354
-They love you.
-As they should.

53
00:04:56,574 --> 00:04:58,779
When I was a young buck...

54
00:04:58,991 --> 00:05:04,741
...my fade-away pitch was compared
to the trouble ball of Satchel Paige.

55
00:05:04,952 --> 00:05:09,409
-Spit on this for me, Smithers.
-One hawker coming up, sir.

56
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:15,905
What a lame-o!

57
00:05:16,122 --> 00:05:19,903
-I could hear the air being torn, sir.
-Oh, shut up!

58
00:05:20,123 --> 00:05:21,995
Hey, Burns! Hey, rag arm!

59
00:05:22,207 --> 00:05:26,367
-You throw like my sister!
-Yeah, you throw like me!

60
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:30,531
To honor America, please rise
for our national anthem...

61
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:36,334
...sung by Springfield's R & B
sensation, "Bleeding Gums" Murphy.

62
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:47,973
Dan Horde, mikeside. Our Isotopes take
on the Shelbyville Shelbyvillians.

63
00:06:48,192 --> 00:06:52,317
We look to snap the longest
losing streak in pro baseball.

64
00:06:52,526 --> 00:06:55,395
How about that?
We're in the record book!

65
00:06:55,819 --> 00:06:59,315
Sitting with the employees
proves I'm their friend.

66
00:06:59,528 --> 00:07:03,274
Get me an aisle seat.
I don't want to be surrounded.

67
00:07:03,488 --> 00:07:05,395
Let's go! Swing, batter!

68
00:07:05,614 --> 00:07:11,114
-We want a pitcher, not an itcher!
-We want a catcher, not a scratcher!

69
00:07:11,323 --> 00:07:13,860
-Here we are, sir.
-Oh, no!

70
00:07:16,701 --> 00:07:22,236
Sitting next to the boss. The best
night of the year and it's ruined.

71
00:07:22,452 --> 00:07:24,325
Of all the lousy, rotten....

72
00:07:24,536 --> 00:07:28,447
It just means you can't wave
your fanny in public.

73
00:07:28,662 --> 00:07:30,737
Rub it in.

74
00:07:32,621 --> 00:07:37,245
-Beer here! Duff Beer!
-Beer. Did you hear that, Marge?

75
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:43,076
Delicious, frosty beer. Fat lot of
good it does me sitting next to Burns.

76
00:07:43,292 --> 00:07:44,536
Now, Homer.

77
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,500
-I suppose you want a beer?
-Me, sir?

78
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:50,708
Not a chance. Only idiots drink beer.

79
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:54,167
I wonder if you'd join me. My treat.

80
00:07:54,379 --> 00:08:00,128
If someone of your stature can enjoy a
beer, maybe I'm wrong on the subject.

81
00:08:00,339 --> 00:08:04,913
-Are we having a drug test tomorrow?
-No. Vendor, two, please.

82
00:08:06,341 --> 00:08:07,798
2.50.

83
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:14,753
The hitter's off his rocker,
kissing Betty Crocker!

84
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:16,338
Good one, sir!

85
00:08:16,552 --> 00:08:21,424
I used to rile Connie Mack
with that one at old Shibe Park.

86
00:08:21,637 --> 00:08:25,169
Little baby batter,
can't control his bladder!

87
00:08:25,388 --> 00:08:27,462
Crude, but I like it.

88
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,889
What do you say we freshen up
our little drinkie-poos?

89
00:08:32,098 --> 00:08:34,054
Don't mind if I do.

90
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:42,636
-Well, Simpsie, up for another wave?
-All right, Burnsie.

91
00:08:46,811 --> 00:08:50,225
Bases loaded,
'Topes have 1 out, down by 3.

92
00:08:50,437 --> 00:08:53,436
Swung on and missed.
Strike 3, of course.

93
00:08:53,646 --> 00:08:57,427
These banjos couldn't carry
Pie Traynor's glove.

94
00:08:57,648 --> 00:09:01,772
After Bill McCIoskey pops out,
our post-game show starts.

95
00:09:01,982 --> 00:09:05,978
Come on! All we need is a grand slam!

96
00:09:07,109 --> 00:09:12,444
My one game of the year,
ruined by pathetic incompetence!

97
00:09:13,777 --> 00:09:16,776
What's wrong with you?
Show some spirit!

98
00:09:16,987 --> 00:09:20,318
Your team needs you! Come on!

99
00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:26,066
As I got up, I felt an intoxication
that had nothing to do with alcohol.

100
00:09:26,282 --> 00:09:30,111
It was the intoxication
of being a public spectacle.

101
00:09:30,324 --> 00:09:32,316
Some nut's dancing!

102
00:09:32,533 --> 00:09:38,532
He has the crowd going. Can he shake
up mediocre slugger Bill McCloskey?

103
00:09:42,162 --> 00:09:45,777
Swung on and belted
to deep left field!

104
00:09:46,704 --> 00:09:49,573
Going, going, gone! It's out of here!

105
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:55,704
Oh, my God! The Isotopes win a game!
The Isotopes win a game!

106
00:09:55,915 --> 00:09:58,535
-That was certainly exciting.
-Yes.

107
00:09:58,749 --> 00:10:04,167
But Simpson's shameless display
of exhibitionism tainted the evening.

108
00:10:04,376 --> 00:10:07,790
He's banned for life
from all company outings.

109
00:10:10,669 --> 00:10:11,914
Way to go, Homer.

110
00:10:12,129 --> 00:10:17,285
Thank you. You're too kind,
but I can't take all the credit.

111
00:10:17,505 --> 00:10:19,876
The batter did his part too.

112
00:10:20,089 --> 00:10:22,709
Excuse me. You, the dancing fella.

113
00:10:22,924 --> 00:10:26,290
I'm Antoine "Tex" O'Hara.
I own the Isotopes.

114
00:10:26,508 --> 00:10:32,672
-Would you like to be our mascot?
-Me? A mascot for a bush-league team?

115
00:10:32,885 --> 00:10:36,797
I should've slept on it,
or at least stared blankly.

116
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:42,215
If I hadn't thought of a nickname,
all our lives might've been spared.

117
00:10:42,554 --> 00:10:47,925
-Get on the bus, Dancing Homer!
-Shut up! I'm thinking of a name!

118
00:10:51,098 --> 00:10:53,588
Well, I'm ready to punch in.

119
00:10:54,516 --> 00:10:59,010
-Hey, cool, man!
-Our lives have taken an odd turn.

120
00:10:59,227 --> 00:11:03,683
-Did they ask you to dress like that?
-No, this was my idea.

121
00:11:03,894 --> 00:11:08,352
Don't fill up on those vegetables.
Save room for nachos.

122
00:11:08,562 --> 00:11:10,139
All right!

123
00:11:12,356 --> 00:11:17,974
For the first time, people didn't
laugh at me. They laughed towards me.

124
00:11:18,649 --> 00:11:21,138
'Topes win! Two in a row!

125
00:11:31,778 --> 00:11:35,903
A Simpson on a T-shirt!
I never thought I'd see the day.

126
00:11:40,322 --> 00:11:43,357
I'll stick this
where the sun don't shine.

127
00:11:43,573 --> 00:11:47,236
Oh yeah? And where might that be?

128
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,484
I'm in a Caribbean mood tonight.

129
00:11:57,703 --> 00:12:01,828
Give me "Baby Elephant Walk"
with a little reggae beat.

130
00:12:08,747 --> 00:12:14,828
-Go, Dancing Homer! Get up, man!
-Lively up yourself, Dancing Homer.

131
00:12:20,168 --> 00:12:24,376
Bases loaded, two outs.
The good guys trail by a run.

132
00:12:25,586 --> 00:12:28,620
S-P-R-...

133
00:12:28,837 --> 00:12:31,587
...-l-N-G-...

134
00:12:31,796 --> 00:12:34,581
...-F-E-E-L-D!

135
00:12:34,797 --> 00:12:36,622
Springfield!

136
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:41,048
Here's the pitch.
Swung on and missed. Strike three.

137
00:12:41,257 --> 00:12:42,631
'Topes lose.

138
00:12:42,841 --> 00:12:46,706
'Topes lose. 'Topes lose.

139
00:12:51,594 --> 00:12:53,301
You wanted to see me?

140
00:12:53,512 --> 00:12:59,177
Now we both knew when you began doing
this, you wouldn't be here forever.

141
00:12:59,388 --> 00:13:03,335
You can't fire the players,
so you fire the mascot!

142
00:13:03,556 --> 00:13:06,508
-You make me sick.
-I'm not firing you.

143
00:13:06,723 --> 00:13:09,888
You've been called up to Capital City.

144
00:13:10,099 --> 00:13:12,470
-Me? The majors?
-That's right.

145
00:13:12,683 --> 00:13:17,010
Wait, Capital City has a mascot.
The greatest one there is:

146
00:13:17,226 --> 00:13:19,135
The Capital City Goofball.

147
00:13:19,352 --> 00:13:24,141
He's getting old, needs someone
to fill in a few innings a night.

148
00:13:24,354 --> 00:13:27,021
-Could be a big opportunity.
-I'll say!

149
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:32,054
-Why don't you talk to your family?
-Because they might say no.

150
00:13:32,273 --> 00:13:37,808
This was a big decision. I should've
listened to my kids, not my dumb wife.

151
00:13:38,024 --> 00:13:41,391
I shouldn't call her that.
Bite my tongue.

152
00:13:41,609 --> 00:13:45,307
I can't go! I was born here.
I thought I'd die here.

153
00:13:45,526 --> 00:13:48,810
It's not so bad.
You'll die someplace else.

154
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:54,066
-What do I do about friends?
-You'll make new, better friends.

155
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:57,942
But, Dad, we're simple people
with simple values.

156
00:13:58,155 --> 00:14:03,491
Capital City is too complex. Everyone
here knows us and has forgiven us.

157
00:14:03,699 --> 00:14:07,564
I'd be lying if I didn't say
this scares me a little.

158
00:14:07,784 --> 00:14:12,194
But we all have a calling,
a reason God put us on this earth.

159
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:14,448
Yours is dancing on dugouts.

160
00:14:14,661 --> 00:14:16,652
-You mean--?
-Let's do it!

161
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,944
Let's never look back!

162
00:14:19,162 --> 00:14:23,158
Whatever doesn't kill me
can only make me stronger.

163
00:14:23,372 --> 00:14:27,746
I've gotta convince my supervisor
to give me time off.

164
00:14:27,957 --> 00:14:31,204
Sure. What would you like?
Four, five years?

165
00:14:31,415 --> 00:14:34,581
So you're really moving
to Capital City?

166
00:14:34,792 --> 00:14:37,744
-That's right.
-And all this is for sale?

167
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:40,627
I don't know how to say this, but....

168
00:14:40,835 --> 00:14:44,166
Knock it off.
Don't start blubbering on me.

169
00:14:44,378 --> 00:14:46,784
I'm gonna miss you too. Not.

170
00:14:47,004 --> 00:14:50,335
I don't know.
I'll miss you and all, but--

171
00:14:50,546 --> 00:14:53,878
Milhouse, this way,
we'll be friends forever.

172
00:14:54,089 --> 00:14:56,127
Well, okay.

173
00:14:58,466 --> 00:15:02,674
-I'll miss you, spit brother.
-I'll miss you, spit brother.

174
00:15:03,467 --> 00:15:10,082
If we had known each other better, my
leaving would actually mean something.

175
00:15:12,095 --> 00:15:16,421
We have one quick stop,
and then it's on to Capital City.

176
00:15:16,638 --> 00:15:19,839
I can't believe it. Our baby sister.

177
00:15:20,055 --> 00:15:22,379
-I'll call every day.
-Me too.

178
00:15:23,598 --> 00:15:26,716
Look. He can use a horn.

179
00:15:27,516 --> 00:15:29,057
Oh, shut up!

180
00:15:30,726 --> 00:15:35,964
Some may say that I have been
given a bad break in life.

181
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:40,476
Little education,
bald as a cue ball...

182
00:15:40,729 --> 00:15:45,103
...10 years on the same job
for the same salary.

183
00:15:45,689 --> 00:15:49,730
But today,
as I leave for Capital City...

184
00:15:50,231 --> 00:15:56,479
...I consider myself the luckiest
mascot on the face of the earth.

185
00:16:02,318 --> 00:16:05,318
With the fickle fans
already forgetting me...

186
00:16:05,528 --> 00:16:09,226
...I was ready to take
the biggest step of my life.

187
00:16:16,656 --> 00:16:20,236
Well, kids. There it is! Capital City!

188
00:16:20,449 --> 00:16:24,029
Look! The Crosstown Bridge.

189
00:16:24,242 --> 00:16:26,233
-Wow!
-Wow.

190
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,358
The Pennyloafer!

191
00:16:43,206 --> 00:16:46,288
Kids, look! Street crime.

192
00:16:50,667 --> 00:16:53,500
Wow, that's service.

193
00:16:59,878 --> 00:17:04,204
-Look, it's Tony Bennett!
-Hey, good to see you.

194
00:17:16,216 --> 00:17:19,085
Fourth Street and D!

195
00:17:25,552 --> 00:17:28,041
The Duff Brewery!

196
00:17:44,641 --> 00:17:47,675
Capital City, yeah!

197
00:17:51,518 --> 00:17:57,054
C-A-P-I....

198
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:01,895
-Come to bed, Homie.
-Sorry, honey.

199
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:04,814
I'm just a little nervous.

200
00:18:05,772 --> 00:18:10,266
We would talk about it always:
For the first time ever...

201
00:18:10,483 --> 00:18:13,731
...Marge fell asleep before I did.

202
00:18:15,317 --> 00:18:17,771
Okay, here are your tickets.

203
00:18:17,985 --> 00:18:21,600
You're with the players' wives.
Cheer for me.

204
00:18:21,819 --> 00:18:24,569
See you afterwards when you're a star.

205
00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:26,604
Bart was strangely quiet.

206
00:18:26,821 --> 00:18:30,602
Later, he said he was confused
by his respect for me.

207
00:18:30,823 --> 00:18:32,647
It wouldn't last.

208
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:40,566
Oh, my God, I don't believe it.
It's you!

209
00:18:40,783 --> 00:18:44,944
-The Capital City Goofball.
-Hello, glad to have you.

210
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:48,905
If you need anything,
just squeeze the wheeze.

211
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:56,161
The 5th inning will be yours. Everyone
is settled in, had a couple of beers.

212
00:18:56,372 --> 00:18:58,943
-It's an important inning.
-The 5th.

213
00:18:59,164 --> 00:19:03,373
It's also the inning
I wish I had a zipper in the front.

214
00:19:03,582 --> 00:19:07,707
-Right, Mr. Goofball.
-Call me Goof. What's your plan?

215
00:19:07,917 --> 00:19:12,990
I dance and spell out the name
of the city to "Baby Elephant Walk."

216
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:15,781
Mancini: the mascot's best friend.

217
00:19:16,003 --> 00:19:20,460
See you on that field.
I set them up, you knock them down.

218
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:29,750
Dave Glass talking at you. We got
great weather tonight under the dome.

219
00:19:30,632 --> 00:19:35,256
Let's see.
Upper, upper, upper mezzanine.

220
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:39,962
-Yes, these must be ours.
-These seats stink!

221
00:19:40,177 --> 00:19:45,677
-I thought the wives would be closer.
-This section is for the ex-wives.

222
00:19:45,886 --> 00:19:51,339
-He had some bimbo in Kansas City.
-Throw at his head!

223
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:58,848
A free ticket to a big-league park,
but I was too tense to enjoy the game.

224
00:19:59,057 --> 00:20:02,838
I was too focused on the task at hand.

225
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:06,472
-Red Hots! Get your Red Hots!
-Ooh, Red Hots.

226
00:20:06,684 --> 00:20:12,765
Ladies and gentlemen, Capital City's
newest sensation: Dancin' Homer!

227
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:17,018
These do taste better at the ballpark.

228
00:20:19,104 --> 00:20:20,763
There he is!

229
00:20:20,981 --> 00:20:25,521
I was graceful. I was witty.
Brother, I was something!

230
00:20:25,732 --> 00:20:28,186
But they didn't care.

231
00:20:29,733 --> 00:20:32,567
What is with these people?

232
00:20:32,775 --> 00:20:35,810
-What's he doing wrong?
-I don't know.

233
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:39,891
It was so quiet,
I could hear each smart-ass remark.

234
00:20:40,111 --> 00:20:45,233
-He doesn't make me want to cheer.
-I pity him, making a fool of himself.

235
00:20:45,446 --> 00:20:48,979
These cornball antics
don't play in Capital City!

236
00:20:49,197 --> 00:20:52,445
The only applause I got
was for leaving.

237
00:20:53,782 --> 00:20:58,322
Mr. Showmanship, the owner wants
to see you in his office.

238
00:20:58,533 --> 00:21:03,691
I'm sorry, you're not ready. Pick up
your check. And put some clothes on!

239
00:21:03,911 --> 00:21:06,115
Well, back to Springfield.

240
00:21:06,328 --> 00:21:09,575
I can't!
Not after I've seen Capital City!

241
00:21:09,829 --> 00:21:12,400
I'll wither and die like a flower.

242
00:21:12,622 --> 00:21:17,078
Stop it. Don't look too down.
It's hard enough for your dad.

243
00:21:17,289 --> 00:21:22,114
-All right, Homer! Way to go!
-What a family.

244
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:24,371
My wife and kids stood by me.

245
00:21:24,584 --> 00:21:28,365
On the way home,
I realized how little that helped.

246
00:21:28,584 --> 00:21:31,583
So that's it.
The costume's buried now.

247
00:21:31,794 --> 00:21:35,705
As my son would say,
I'm one sad, ape-like dude.

248
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,496
-Wow.
-What a saga.

249
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:42,833
You guys are hanging on my every word.
I'm the center of attention.

250
00:21:43,047 --> 00:21:45,916
-It's riveting.
-Tell it again, Homer.

251
00:21:46,131 --> 00:21:52,082
I wonder why stories of degradation
and humiliation make you more popular.

252
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:55,833
I don't know. They just do.
