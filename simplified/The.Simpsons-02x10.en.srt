1
00:01:42,213 --> 00:01:43,885
I think the boy's hurt.

2
00:01:44,133 --> 00:01:47,648
Just give him a nickel
and let's get going!

3
00:01:48,133 --> 00:01:51,250
I think we should call
an ambulance, sir.

4
00:01:55,253 --> 00:01:58,768
Hey, cool. I'm dead!

5
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:06,365
Please hold on to the handrail.

6
00:02:06,573 --> 00:02:08,643
Do not spit over the side.

7
00:02:12,293 --> 00:02:16,002
Aunt Hortense. Great-grandpa Simpson.

8
00:02:16,853 --> 00:02:18,206
Snowball!

9
00:02:18,453 --> 00:02:21,968
Do not spit over the side.

10
00:02:26,053 --> 00:02:29,409
We told you to hold on
to the handrail.

11
00:02:29,613 --> 00:02:34,562
We asked you not to spit
over the side.

12
00:02:39,413 --> 00:02:41,210
Howdy, stranger!

13
00:02:41,413 --> 00:02:43,643
I'm Bart Simpson.
Who the hell are you?

14
00:02:43,893 --> 00:02:48,171
Please allow me to introduce myself.
I'm the devil!

15
00:02:48,373 --> 00:02:52,082
You've earned eternal damnation
for your evil deeds.

16
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:57,168
-Spitting just clinched it.
-Hey, I'm innocent, man!

17
00:02:58,693 --> 00:03:02,049
Innocent! Everybody's innocent.

18
00:03:02,293 --> 00:03:05,569
Okay, let's just
pull up your file here.

19
00:03:08,053 --> 00:03:12,763
It's a mistake. You're due to arrive
when the Yankees win the pennant.

20
00:03:12,973 --> 00:03:16,204
Nearly a century from now.
Boy, is my face red!

21
00:03:16,413 --> 00:03:17,607
Bart!

22
00:03:17,813 --> 00:03:21,488
Is there anything I can do
to avoid coming back here?

23
00:03:21,733 --> 00:03:24,167
Sure, but you wouldn't like it.

24
00:03:24,373 --> 00:03:26,284
-Okay. See you later.
-Bye!

25
00:03:26,533 --> 00:03:30,572
Remember, lie, cheat, steal
and listen to heavy metal music!

26
00:03:30,773 --> 00:03:32,365
Yes, sir!

27
00:03:38,293 --> 00:03:41,490
Dr. Warner, wanted in radiology.

28
00:03:41,733 --> 00:03:43,689
-He's awake!
-Oh, Bart!

29
00:03:43,933 --> 00:03:46,447
We thought you'd gone away from us.

30
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:48,365
I did go away, Mom!

31
00:03:48,573 --> 00:03:52,771
I was miles away, writhing in agony
in the pits of hell!

32
00:03:53,013 --> 00:03:56,449
And you were there!
And you. And you. And you.

33
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,609
You I've never seen before.

34
00:03:58,853 --> 00:04:01,651
Yeah, I saw you
chasing Bart's ambulance.

35
00:04:01,893 --> 00:04:05,681
Lionel Hutz is the name.
Attorney at law. My card.

36
00:04:05,893 --> 00:04:08,361
-It turns into a sponge in water.
-Classy.

37
00:04:08,613 --> 00:04:13,289
Would you like to bring legal action
against the fiend who did this?

38
00:04:13,533 --> 00:04:16,764
The fiend who did this
to my boy is my boss.

39
00:04:16,973 --> 00:04:21,888
Besides, the doctor says it's just
a bump on the head and a broken toe.

40
00:04:22,213 --> 00:04:24,443
Doctors are idiots!

41
00:04:24,693 --> 00:04:29,084
He might have permanent injuries.
You may have to wait on him...

42
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:32,689
...for the rest of his life!
That's the downside.

43
00:04:32,933 --> 00:04:37,768
Here's the good part.
You can cash in on this tragedy!

44
00:04:37,973 --> 00:04:42,888
-Excuse me, are you a shyster?
-How does a nice girl know that word?

45
00:04:43,133 --> 00:04:46,842
Mr. Hutz, this is hardly
the time to discuss this.

46
00:04:47,093 --> 00:04:51,769
You're right. When you're up to it,
come to my office and we'll talk.

47
00:04:51,973 --> 00:04:56,091
Lionel Hutz, attorney at law.
Is that a broken neck? Great!

48
00:04:56,293 --> 00:04:58,682
-Hello, Dr. Hibbert.
-Hello, Lisa.

49
00:04:58,893 --> 00:05:02,090
-We've got a nasty bump on our head.
-Quit it!

50
00:05:02,293 --> 00:05:04,443
-And a tiny broken toe.
-Quit it!

51
00:05:04,693 --> 00:05:08,129
Is he well enough for me
to start mothering him?

52
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:10,449
Better let him rest a while.

53
00:05:11,573 --> 00:05:14,963
-I heard Mr. Burns crushed your boy.
-Yeah.

54
00:05:15,213 --> 00:05:20,571
If I wasn't so spineless, I'd march
into Mr. Burns' office now and--

55
00:05:20,813 --> 00:05:24,931
Simpson! Burns wants you
to march into his office now!

56
00:05:27,693 --> 00:05:30,253
Simpson, at last we meet.

57
00:05:30,493 --> 00:05:32,404
Nice to meet you too, sir.

58
00:05:32,653 --> 00:05:36,646
My attorneys advised me to pay
for running over your child.

59
00:05:36,853 --> 00:05:39,925
-So I'm cutting you a check.
-Really? Great.

60
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:49,369
$100. Of course,
you'll have to sign a waiver...

61
00:05:49,573 --> 00:05:52,007
...relinquishing your right to sue.

62
00:05:52,253 --> 00:05:57,885
100 bucks? It's a generous offer, sir,
but his medical bills alone--

63
00:05:58,133 --> 00:06:01,284
So extortion is the name of your game?

64
00:06:01,533 --> 00:06:06,163
Then you get nothing! I have
the finest lawyers in Springfield.

65
00:06:06,373 --> 00:06:10,764
Tangle with me, and I'll crush you
like a paper cup.

66
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:15,765
Throw him out, Smithers!

67
00:06:16,013 --> 00:06:20,928
You don't have to do that.
I can throw myself out.

68
00:06:25,613 --> 00:06:27,171
Lionel Hutz.

69
00:06:30,773 --> 00:06:32,047
In here, Mr. Simpson.

70
00:06:32,293 --> 00:06:34,966
-Any calls, Della?
-Calls? Oh, "calls" !

71
00:06:35,173 --> 00:06:40,088
The Supreme Court called. They
need your help on a freedom thing.

72
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:45,361
Tell them to sit tight. I'll get back
to them. This way, Mr. Simpson.

73
00:06:45,573 --> 00:06:48,770
You sure have got some education.

74
00:06:48,973 --> 00:06:53,569
Yes, Harvard, Yale, MIT, Oxford,
the Sorbonne, the Louvre.

75
00:06:53,973 --> 00:06:55,565
Oh, well.

76
00:06:55,773 --> 00:06:58,367
Mr. Simpson,
the state bar forbids me...

77
00:06:58,573 --> 00:07:01,371
...from promising you
a big cash settlement.

78
00:07:01,613 --> 00:07:04,844
But just between you and me,
I promise you...

79
00:07:05,093 --> 00:07:08,324
...a big cash settlement.
My fee is 50 percent.

80
00:07:08,533 --> 00:07:12,765
-50 percent?
-You'll be getting more than a lawyer!

81
00:07:12,973 --> 00:07:16,852
You'll also get
this faux pearl necklace...

82
00:07:17,093 --> 00:07:19,288
...a $99 value, as our gift.

83
00:07:19,533 --> 00:07:23,242
I don't know. You and I
might have different ideas...

84
00:07:23,493 --> 00:07:26,565
...about how big
a big cash settlement is.

85
00:07:26,773 --> 00:07:29,241
A million dollars?

86
00:07:29,493 --> 00:07:33,452
I stand corrected!
A million bucks is A-Okay!

87
00:07:43,933 --> 00:07:47,687
Now we'll get a real doctor's opinion.

88
00:07:47,893 --> 00:07:49,963
Bad news!

89
00:07:50,893 --> 00:07:55,364
Your son is a very sick boy.
Just look at the X-rays!

90
00:07:55,573 --> 00:07:58,883
You see that dark spot there?
Whiplash.

91
00:07:59,133 --> 00:08:00,486
Oh, no!

92
00:08:00,733 --> 00:08:04,248
And this smudge that
looks like my fingerprint?

93
00:08:04,493 --> 00:08:06,324
No. That's trauma!

94
00:08:07,773 --> 00:08:11,004
-Am I going to die?
-Yes, son!

95
00:08:11,213 --> 00:08:13,010
Homer!

96
00:08:13,253 --> 00:08:17,007
No, of course you won't.
Everything's fine.

97
00:08:17,253 --> 00:08:20,290
-Will I ever play baseball again?
-No!

98
00:08:21,733 --> 00:08:25,169
-But I played this morning.
-That's right, he did.

99
00:08:25,413 --> 00:08:30,407
Dr. Hibbert has been our physician
for years. He thought Bart was fine.

100
00:08:30,613 --> 00:08:34,606
Oh, Dr. Hibbert,
from Johns Hopkins Medical School.

101
00:08:34,813 --> 00:08:40,012
Mrs. Simpson, you're not a doctor.
He's not, I'm not.

102
00:08:40,213 --> 00:08:43,444
The only person here
who comes close is him.

103
00:08:43,693 --> 00:08:45,763
Stop, you're embarrassing me!

104
00:08:46,013 --> 00:08:50,564
Are you sure there isn't
soft tissue trauma in the face?

105
00:08:50,773 --> 00:08:54,971
Oh, yeah. Tons of it.
Just say when.

106
00:08:55,173 --> 00:08:59,803
A million dollars? Smithers!
I want this Homer Simpson fired!

107
00:09:00,053 --> 00:09:04,490
Do you think that's wise?
Think of the headlines.

108
00:09:12,453 --> 00:09:14,045
What about them?

109
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:19,373
They might be critical of you firing
him so soon after the accident.

110
00:09:19,613 --> 00:09:23,208
All right then.
I don't want to seem like an ogre.

111
00:09:23,453 --> 00:09:25,842
I'll bide my time.

112
00:09:26,093 --> 00:09:29,403
Let him twist in the wind.
Slowly, slowly.

113
00:09:29,613 --> 00:09:33,401
When the papers have found
their new flavor of the month...

114
00:09:33,653 --> 00:09:36,406
...he'll find out this cat has claws!

115
00:09:36,653 --> 00:09:37,847
Good thinking.

116
00:09:38,413 --> 00:09:42,122
Now, let's pretend
you're on the witness stand.

117
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,244
-How are you, Bart?
-Fine.

118
00:09:44,493 --> 00:09:46,245
Bart says he's fine.

119
00:09:46,493 --> 00:09:49,485
You are not fine!
You are in constant pain!

120
00:09:49,733 --> 00:09:51,564
I am in constant pain.

121
00:09:51,773 --> 00:09:54,731
-May I make an observation?
-What is it?

122
00:09:54,933 --> 00:09:58,972
This is a charade to make him
look more injured than he is.

123
00:09:59,213 --> 00:10:00,885
Maybe Lisa has a point.

124
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:05,809
I don't mind it here, but in court,
doesn't he have to tell the truth?

125
00:10:06,053 --> 00:10:08,362
But what is truth, if you follow me?

126
00:10:08,613 --> 00:10:12,845
Bart, can you roll your eyes
back in your head like this?

127
00:10:13,093 --> 00:10:15,561
You mean like I'm dead? Sure.

128
00:10:15,813 --> 00:10:17,565
The kid's a pro.

129
00:10:17,773 --> 00:10:22,688
Springfield Municipal Court is now
in session. Judge Moulton presiding.

130
00:10:22,933 --> 00:10:26,767
My client's instructed me
to remind you how rich he is...

131
00:10:26,973 --> 00:10:29,282
...and that he's not like other men.

132
00:10:29,533 --> 00:10:33,367
I should be able to run over
as many kids as I want!

133
00:10:35,973 --> 00:10:39,602
I warn you, if you continue
to disrupt the court...

134
00:10:39,853 --> 00:10:42,162
...I'll cite you for contempt.

135
00:10:42,413 --> 00:10:46,088
-You wouldn't dare!
-Well, no, I guess I wouldn't.

136
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:49,530
Calling Bartholomew J. Simpson
to the stand.

137
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:54,092
Oh, please!

138
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:59,168
Hello, Bart. You know the difference
between telling the truth...

139
00:10:59,413 --> 00:11:01,847
...and telling a lie, don't you?

140
00:11:02,053 --> 00:11:03,281
Maybe.

141
00:11:03,493 --> 00:11:08,772
Well, you wouldn't lie to
the United States, would you, Bart?

142
00:11:10,053 --> 00:11:11,247
-No.
-Good.

143
00:11:11,493 --> 00:11:14,246
-Proceed, Mr. Hutz.
-Thank you.

144
00:11:14,453 --> 00:11:16,842
Tell the jury, in your own words...

145
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:20,165
...what happened on the day
of the accident.

146
00:11:20,373 --> 00:11:24,048
Yes, sir. It was a beautiful
Sunday afternoon.

147
00:11:24,293 --> 00:11:28,969
I played in my childlike way, not
realizing I was about to be struck...

148
00:11:29,213 --> 00:11:32,364
...by the luxury car of death!

149
00:11:35,613 --> 00:11:38,047
Defenseless child at 3:00!

150
00:11:44,133 --> 00:11:45,964
Luckily, I was not killed.

151
00:11:46,213 --> 00:11:50,491
Although sometimes I wish I had been.

152
00:11:52,373 --> 00:11:53,931
He's lying!

153
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:58,563
Now, that's believable testimony.

154
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:04,211
Mr. Burns, relate in your own words...

155
00:12:04,453 --> 00:12:08,446
...what really happened
on the day of the accident.

156
00:12:08,693 --> 00:12:11,048
Certainly. It was a beautiful day.

157
00:12:11,293 --> 00:12:15,923
The sun was shining. I was driving
to the orphanage to pass out toys.

158
00:12:16,133 --> 00:12:21,002
Suddenly, that incorrigible
Simpson boy darted in front of me.

159
00:12:25,653 --> 00:12:28,042
My goodness! Look what's happened!

160
00:12:28,253 --> 00:12:32,849
-It's not important. Let's drive on.
-You cold-blooded monster!

161
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:36,409
Regardless of what you think,
we must summon help...

162
00:12:36,653 --> 00:12:40,009
...and comfort him
until an ambulance arrives.

163
00:12:40,253 --> 00:12:42,448
No!

164
00:12:42,693 --> 00:12:45,969
Take me, I'm old!

165
00:12:46,173 --> 00:12:48,164
And that's what happened.

166
00:12:51,613 --> 00:12:55,367
Why are you looking at me like that?
You believed his story!

167
00:12:55,613 --> 00:12:59,970
It's looking good, Mr. Simpson.
It's looking very good.

168
00:13:00,373 --> 00:13:04,048
They hate me?
What trial were you watching?

169
00:13:04,293 --> 00:13:07,046
-Maybe a settlement--
-Settlement! Fine!

170
00:13:07,293 --> 00:13:09,284
Hang your heads in shame...

171
00:13:09,533 --> 00:13:12,889
...you overpriced,
under-brained notary publics!

172
00:13:13,133 --> 00:13:17,888
Just get that ape to my house
and we'll buy him off with a banana!

173
00:13:18,133 --> 00:13:22,763
And that ugly customer was
the last Indonesian rhino on earth.

174
00:13:22,973 --> 00:13:25,407
I didn't know you liked animals.

175
00:13:25,653 --> 00:13:29,168
I don't like everything about them.
Just their heads.

176
00:13:29,413 --> 00:13:32,564
Care for some wine, old buddy?

177
00:13:32,773 --> 00:13:35,765
-Don't mind if I do.
-Go, go!

178
00:13:36,293 --> 00:13:40,969
Bottoms up. There's plenty more
where that came from.

179
00:13:41,853 --> 00:13:44,128
Are you trying to get me drunk?

180
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:46,005
Yes. Now, old chum...

181
00:13:46,253 --> 00:13:51,168
...I'm sure you agree this trial is
an affront to our collective dignity.

182
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:54,285
What say we settle this, man to man?

183
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:56,842
You mean duke it out?

184
00:13:57,093 --> 00:14:01,644
No, I mean I'm prepared to offer
you a generous cash settlement.

185
00:14:01,893 --> 00:14:04,646
A princely sum--

186
00:14:04,893 --> 00:14:10,047
Well, a handsome sum that can end
this imbroglio once and for all.

187
00:14:11,813 --> 00:14:15,886
Five hundred thousand dollars.

188
00:14:16,133 --> 00:14:17,691
Goodness!

189
00:14:18,133 --> 00:14:21,205
Don't answer me now.
Relax, talk it over.

190
00:14:21,453 --> 00:14:26,083
Soak in the opulence of your
surroundings and dream of what can be.

191
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:29,006
Smithers, let's go powder my nose.

192
00:14:29,293 --> 00:14:31,966
-What do you think?
-I don't know.

193
00:14:32,213 --> 00:14:35,922
Maybe we should take it
and put this ugliness behind us.

194
00:14:36,493 --> 00:14:39,087
The fish is in the pan.

195
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,767
-What do you think?
-I'll tell you.

196
00:14:41,973 --> 00:14:44,646
I think he thinks I'm an idiot!

197
00:14:44,893 --> 00:14:48,772
He's offering us this
because he knows he'll lose...

198
00:14:48,973 --> 00:14:51,282
...and have to pay us a million.

199
00:14:51,533 --> 00:14:53,012
I feel faint.

200
00:14:53,253 --> 00:14:58,885
$500,000!
I spit on his $500,000!

201
00:15:00,613 --> 00:15:04,367
What's happened to you?
All this greediness and lying...

202
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:07,207
...and shifty lawyers
and phony doctors!

203
00:15:07,653 --> 00:15:09,166
Phony doctors? Hello.

204
00:15:09,413 --> 00:15:13,725
Know what I'd settle for?
The medical bills and an apology.

205
00:15:13,933 --> 00:15:16,572
You won't even get that.
Offer's expired.

206
00:15:16,773 --> 00:15:21,688
We'll let the jury decide. Good day.
Smithers, release the hounds.

207
00:15:26,293 --> 00:15:29,683
Your Honor, I'd like
to call to the stand...

208
00:15:30,253 --> 00:15:32,642
...Mrs. Homer J. Simpson!

209
00:15:39,613 --> 00:15:44,403
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth, so help you God?

210
00:15:44,613 --> 00:15:45,807
Yes, I do.

211
00:15:46,053 --> 00:15:49,682
-She was taking that very seriously.
-Oh, the truth!

212
00:15:51,173 --> 00:15:55,610
Mrs. Simpson, does the name
Julius Hibbert mean anything to you?

213
00:15:55,853 --> 00:15:59,163
Yes, he's been our family physician
and friend...

214
00:15:59,373 --> 00:16:01,648
...ever since I became a mother.

215
00:16:01,893 --> 00:16:06,569
He's seen us through everything
with competence and loving care.

216
00:16:06,773 --> 00:16:09,606
But wait a minute! I'm confused.

217
00:16:09,853 --> 00:16:15,007
This court heard expert testimony
from one Dr. Nick Riviera.

218
00:16:15,213 --> 00:16:17,443
What's your opinion of him?

219
00:16:18,893 --> 00:16:23,489
My mother said, "If you can't say
anything nice, don't say anything."

220
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:26,486
-Will that hold up?
-No, I've tried.

221
00:16:26,733 --> 00:16:29,691
What is your opinion of Dr. Riviera?

222
00:16:29,933 --> 00:16:32,811
And let me remind you,
you're under oath!

223
00:16:33,053 --> 00:16:34,850
To be honest...

224
00:16:35,093 --> 00:16:39,052
...he seemed more concerned
about wrapping Bart in bandages...

225
00:16:39,293 --> 00:16:41,568
...than making him feel better.

226
00:16:41,813 --> 00:16:44,850
And he mispronounced words
like "abdomen."

227
00:16:45,093 --> 00:16:46,970
And his office was dirty!

228
00:16:47,213 --> 00:16:51,126
Now that I think about it,
I'm not sure he's a doctor.

229
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:55,008
And could you describe for us
in your own words...

230
00:16:55,253 --> 00:16:58,882
...Bart's "intense mental anguish
and suffering"?

231
00:16:59,133 --> 00:17:02,284
Well, I don't know
how intense it was...

232
00:17:02,773 --> 00:17:06,163
...but he did miss
three days of school.

233
00:17:06,373 --> 00:17:09,490
Although he doesn't like school...

234
00:17:09,733 --> 00:17:12,566
...so that may not count as anguish.

235
00:17:12,773 --> 00:17:16,402
It was hard on me,
having him around the house.

236
00:17:16,653 --> 00:17:20,362
Could you put a dollar amount
on all these hardships?

237
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:24,088
We pay Bart $5 a week
to take out the trash.

238
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:29,361
I suppose if he'd been able to do it,
we might've given him the $5.

239
00:17:29,573 --> 00:17:30,972
$5?

240
00:17:31,173 --> 00:17:35,564
But your lawyer, assuming he is one,
is asking for a million!

241
00:17:35,773 --> 00:17:38,845
Well, we can't blame them
for trying, can we?

242
00:17:39,173 --> 00:17:42,370
Thank you, Mrs. Simpson.

243
00:17:45,973 --> 00:17:48,407
I'm going to write a figure down.

244
00:17:48,653 --> 00:17:51,804
It's not quite as large
as the last one...

245
00:17:52,053 --> 00:17:54,692
...but I think you'll find it fair.

246
00:17:54,893 --> 00:17:56,451
We should take it.

247
00:17:56,693 --> 00:18:01,562
A million dollars.
My wife cost me a million dollars.

248
00:18:01,813 --> 00:18:04,566
Would you like
more macaroni and cheese?

249
00:18:04,773 --> 00:18:07,492
A million dollars' worth,
you snake-woman!

250
00:18:07,733 --> 00:18:09,371
-No.
-String beans?

251
00:18:09,613 --> 00:18:13,003
No, you two-timing, backstabbing--
Better answer.

252
00:18:13,253 --> 00:18:15,687
-No.
-Celery with cream cheese?

253
00:18:15,933 --> 00:18:18,845
Just mouth polite nothings.

254
00:18:19,093 --> 00:18:22,005
It would've been cool
to get that million.

255
00:18:22,253 --> 00:18:23,288
Bart, please.

256
00:18:23,533 --> 00:18:26,093
We could've bought tons
of great stuff.

257
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:29,769
Maids, a pool, fancy sweaters.
Stop me if I'm wrong.

258
00:18:29,973 --> 00:18:33,807
-Marge, may I go to Moe's for a drink?
-Sure.

259
00:18:34,013 --> 00:18:36,004
I may never come back.

260
00:18:36,253 --> 00:18:37,766
Good night.

261
00:18:37,973 --> 00:18:41,363
My woman's intuition
is telling me something.

262
00:18:41,573 --> 00:18:43,404
I wonder-- Oh, my God.

263
00:18:45,973 --> 00:18:49,602
Well, I guess this is
the class I'll die in.

264
00:18:49,853 --> 00:18:53,448
You're better off.
Rich people aren't happy.

265
00:18:53,693 --> 00:18:58,164
They think they're happy
but trust me, they ain't.

266
00:18:58,413 --> 00:19:00,529
Moe, I wish he'd shut up.

267
00:19:04,093 --> 00:19:07,051
-A chick!
-And it's not even ladies' night.

268
00:19:07,293 --> 00:19:10,763
Hey, guys. Knock it off!
It's just my wife.

269
00:19:11,013 --> 00:19:14,528
-Well, hello.
-My name's Marge.

270
00:19:15,893 --> 00:19:20,409
Homer, I'd like you to forgive me
for doing the right thing.

271
00:19:21,653 --> 00:19:25,362
We've squabbled over money before.
Never this much.

272
00:19:25,573 --> 00:19:30,488
It's different than when I washed
your pants with the 20 in the pocket--

273
00:19:30,733 --> 00:19:35,568
You think this is about money?
It's not. It's worse.

274
00:19:36,013 --> 00:19:38,686
I'm afraid that when I look at you...

275
00:19:38,933 --> 00:19:43,245
...I won't see the wife by my side
or the mother of my children.

276
00:19:43,493 --> 00:19:47,088
I'll see the dame
who blew my one big chance.

277
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:49,972
-What are you saying?
-I'm saying--

278
00:19:50,173 --> 00:19:53,882
She's your wife of 10 years,
you've had 3 children.

279
00:19:54,133 --> 00:19:55,771
It's time to be honest.

280
00:19:56,013 --> 00:19:58,811
I'm not sure I love you anymore.

281
00:19:59,053 --> 00:20:02,807
Don't worry, I won't let on.
I'll still do the bed stuff.

282
00:20:03,053 --> 00:20:06,170
-Maybe it won't be so bad.
-Oh, my Lord!

283
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:10,491
I don't want to wait to find out
if you love me anymore.

284
00:20:10,733 --> 00:20:16,171
I think that you should look me
in the eyes and find out.

285
00:20:16,373 --> 00:20:18,933
Homer, look at me!

286
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:23,770
Do it if it'll shut her up.
Start with the feet. Still angry.

287
00:20:24,013 --> 00:20:25,241
Good, Homer!

288
00:20:25,493 --> 00:20:29,008
This is tough, need refreshment.
Trustworthy beer.

289
00:20:29,213 --> 00:20:31,488
My love for you will never die.

290
00:20:31,733 --> 00:20:35,965
All right, look the wife
straight in the eyes and tell her--

291
00:20:40,493 --> 00:20:44,202
Who am I kidding?
I love you more than ever!

292
00:20:44,413 --> 00:20:49,567
-I love you too!
-Sorry to scare you like that, babe.

293
00:20:50,413 --> 00:20:52,085
Okay, everybody!

294
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:57,361
For the next 15 minutes,
one-third off on every pitcher.

295
00:20:58,973 --> 00:21:03,967
One per customer, domestic beer only.
Hey, no sharing!
