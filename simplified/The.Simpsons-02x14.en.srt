00:00:05,573 --> 00:00:07,404
Bart's Dog Gets An F

2
00:01:29,573 --> 00:01:31,723
No! No!

3
00:01:31,973 --> 00:01:34,806
Bad dog! Let go!

4
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:37,362
Bad Santa's Little Helper! Stop!

5
00:01:37,613 --> 00:01:40,081
Not the sports section!

6
00:01:44,933 --> 00:01:46,366
Stupid dog!

7
00:01:50,973 --> 00:01:55,285
No! Stay away! This is not for you!
This is Homer food!

8
00:02:00,653 --> 00:02:04,248
Time to get up, Lisa.
It's a school day.

9
00:02:05,773 --> 00:02:08,082
Lisa, you don't look well.

10
00:02:08,293 --> 00:02:12,286
I'll make it, Mom.
Just tape my lunch box to my hand.

11
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:16,765
My, you're burning up.
And your cheeks are so swollen.

12
00:02:16,973 --> 00:02:20,443
I think you have the mumps.
I'll call Dr. Hibbert.

13
00:02:20,653 --> 00:02:24,612
-The dog is hungry.
-Well, then, feed him.

14
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:27,731
Yes, master.

15
00:02:33,573 --> 00:02:39,011
You're my best friend.
You're my best friend.

16
00:02:52,133 --> 00:02:55,170
Hello, Dr. Hibbert?

17
00:02:55,413 --> 00:02:59,611
Not that I'm angry,
but how did you get my home number?

18
00:03:00,773 --> 00:03:02,650
I see. Quite ingenious.

19
00:03:02,893 --> 00:03:04,770
I think Lisa has the mumps.

20
00:03:05,133 --> 00:03:06,725
Well, Mrs. Simpson...

21
00:03:06,973 --> 00:03:12,093
...I'd like to rely on your diagnosis,
but it'd be derelict of me to do so.

22
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:14,164
Let me check my schedule.

23
00:03:14,773 --> 00:03:17,526
2:00 is fine. Thank you, Dr. Hibbert.

24
00:03:17,773 --> 00:03:21,732
No way, she's faking.
If Lisa stays home, I stay home.

25
00:03:21,973 --> 00:03:25,682
-lf Bart stays home, I go to school.
-Fine, then--

26
00:03:25,933 --> 00:03:31,132
Wait. If Lisa goes to school, I go.
But if she stays, I stay, so...

27
00:03:31,373 --> 00:03:34,410
-...Lisa goes to school....
-Don't confuse him.

28
00:03:34,613 --> 00:03:37,844
-Have a nice day at school.
-Get my homework.

29
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:39,128
Homework?

30
00:03:39,373 --> 00:03:44,242
Lisa, you wasted chicken pox.
Don't waste the mumps.

31
00:03:56,533 --> 00:03:58,524
-Bart-dude!
-Hey, Otto-man!

32
00:03:58,773 --> 00:04:02,209
-Yo, hairy bro.
-Go home, boy. Go home.

33
00:04:21,093 --> 00:04:25,052
Wandering mongrel. Get out of
my mom-and-pop operation.

34
00:04:30,773 --> 00:04:33,287
-Hello?
-This is Sylvia Winfield.

35
00:04:33,493 --> 00:04:38,089
Your canine is in my pool again.
I'm calling the dog warden.

36
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:44,283
Are you? You go ahead and call your
precious dog warden, you old axe...

37
00:04:44,533 --> 00:04:46,967
...because my dog is tied up!

38
00:04:47,213 --> 00:04:49,329
There's only one family...

39
00:04:49,573 --> 00:04:53,964
...on Earth inconsiderate enough
to let that monster roam free!

40
00:04:55,373 --> 00:04:58,285
Are you going deaf,
or are you just stupid?

41
00:04:58,533 --> 00:05:03,323
I'll explain one more time,
and then I'm going to hang up on you.

42
00:05:03,573 --> 00:05:06,292
It is not my dog!

43
00:05:06,533 --> 00:05:11,482
I tied my dog outside myself!

44
00:05:11,693 --> 00:05:13,684
I am looking at him right--

45
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:19,766
Well, how-doodlie-do.

46
00:05:19,973 --> 00:05:22,567
Getting some exercise?
Good for you.

47
00:05:23,133 --> 00:05:28,412
Look at this rascal. He's a wet boy,
isn't he? You're a water monster.

48
00:05:28,653 --> 00:05:32,692
Well, well, "Mr. Universe"
takes a walk.

49
00:05:32,893 --> 00:05:34,292
"Mr. Universe, " I wish.

50
00:05:34,533 --> 00:05:40,881
Look at that get-up. Heavy hands,
ankle weights, that's cute, and--

51
00:05:41,093 --> 00:05:42,685
-Assassins!
-You bet.

52
00:05:42,893 --> 00:05:49,287
They've got Velcro, a water pump,
built-in odometer, and vanity plates.

53
00:05:49,773 --> 00:05:53,527
-How much?
-Well, they're not giving them away.

54
00:05:53,773 --> 00:05:57,732
-But you've got to spoil yourself.
-Yeah.

55
00:05:57,973 --> 00:06:01,488
My heart rate's dropping.
Better skedaddle-y-do.

56
00:06:05,093 --> 00:06:08,130
-Discoloration of the glands.
-Oh, dear.

57
00:06:08,373 --> 00:06:10,933
-Swelling of the parotids.
-I knew it.

58
00:06:11,773 --> 00:06:15,652
Lisa has the mumps.
You'll be missing a week of school.

59
00:06:15,893 --> 00:06:19,886
Oh, no. I don't want to fall behind
my class.

60
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:25,326
Such responsibility.
What's your favorite subject?

61
00:06:25,573 --> 00:06:26,801
Arithmetic.

62
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:32,685
Arithmetic. Before you know it, you'll
be back among your polygons...

63
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:37,883
...and your Euclidian algorithms.
You get rest and have a lollipop.

64
00:06:40,493 --> 00:06:43,326
Hello? Hi, Lisa, what's wrong?

65
00:06:43,573 --> 00:06:46,929
The mumps? Oh, the kissing disease.

66
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:49,289
My little girl is growing up.

67
00:06:50,373 --> 00:06:52,284
Yuck. Quit it, Dad.

68
00:06:52,533 --> 00:06:55,525
So, what does my little girl want?
What?

69
00:06:55,773 --> 00:06:58,492
Let me write this down. Copies of...

70
00:06:58,693 --> 00:07:02,527
... Teen Dream, Teen Scream...

71
00:07:02,773 --> 00:07:05,685
...and Teen Steam magazine?

72
00:07:05,933 --> 00:07:09,323
Well, okay, you're the sickie.
Goodbye, Lisa.

73
00:07:09,573 --> 00:07:12,406
Lenny, I need to leave. Cover for me.

74
00:07:12,653 --> 00:07:14,883
Hey, sure thing, Homer.

75
00:07:21,573 --> 00:07:23,086
Well, Lisa, here it is.

76
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:25,722
The Bouvier family quilt.

77
00:07:25,973 --> 00:07:29,852
Wow, neat. It smells historic.

78
00:07:33,293 --> 00:07:37,332
For five generations, women
in our family have added to it.

79
00:07:37,573 --> 00:07:39,131
Now it's your turn.

80
00:07:39,373 --> 00:07:42,683
-I don't know how.
-You do, you just don't know it.

81
00:07:42,893 --> 00:07:47,887
The memory of a million drop stitches
flows in your veins.

82
00:07:50,733 --> 00:07:54,282
-Very impressive.
-You try it.

83
00:07:54,973 --> 00:07:57,885
You just need to develop a callous.

84
00:08:00,173 --> 00:08:04,724
You see? Now that's
a sewing finger, honey.

85
00:08:09,213 --> 00:08:11,044
Oh, man, $2.00?

86
00:08:12,373 --> 00:08:14,489
I'll take these three.

87
00:08:14,733 --> 00:08:17,088
-They're for my daughter.
-Sure.

88
00:08:17,973 --> 00:08:19,167
Wise guy.

89
00:08:24,013 --> 00:08:25,207
Assassins!

90
00:08:25,453 --> 00:08:27,808
Oh, 125 bucks!

91
00:08:28,293 --> 00:08:32,127
Sometimes you've gotta
spoil yourself.

92
00:08:32,373 --> 00:08:33,931
-But I can't--
-Simpson!

93
00:08:34,173 --> 00:08:37,563
-I order you to buy those shoes!
-You're the boss!

94
00:08:37,813 --> 00:08:40,646
-This one's mine.
-"Keep On Truckin' "?

95
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:44,732
-What does that mean?
-I didn't know then. I don't know now.

96
00:08:44,973 --> 00:08:47,089
Here's your stupid homework.

97
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:52,453
Phonics, functions, vocabulary,
remedial reading?

98
00:08:52,773 --> 00:08:55,162
Do your own homework, Bart!

99
00:08:55,413 --> 00:08:58,689
Your magazines. How many
of these guys are Corey?

100
00:08:58,893 --> 00:09:00,212
Eight. Thanks, Dad.

101
00:09:01,253 --> 00:09:03,972
-Assassins!
-Yep. Read 'em and weep.

102
00:09:04,213 --> 00:09:08,331
-Those are very elaborate.
-They better be, for $125.

103
00:09:08,573 --> 00:09:10,291
-$125!
-Bart!

104
00:09:11,933 --> 00:09:14,925
We agreed to consult before
major purchases.

105
00:09:15,173 --> 00:09:19,883
You bought those smoke alarms,
and we haven't had a single fire.

106
00:09:20,253 --> 00:09:23,325
A manhunt, or "woman-hunt", is on--

107
00:09:23,773 --> 00:09:27,004
You know, yours is the only show
I'll do.

108
00:09:28,933 --> 00:09:32,448
As an actor, my eyes
need to look their whitest--

109
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:35,931
It's a penalty kick--

110
00:09:52,573 --> 00:09:54,689
Shoelace....

111
00:09:55,573 --> 00:09:57,291
No!

112
00:10:09,573 --> 00:10:13,532
There seems to be a lot
of good obedience schools here.

113
00:10:13,773 --> 00:10:16,241
School's your answer to everything....

114
00:10:22,773 --> 00:10:25,526
This one looks very reputable.

115
00:10:30,373 --> 00:10:32,125
Lovely. Have a toffee.

116
00:10:32,373 --> 00:10:36,685
Such a neat dog. Have at them.
Well done.

117
00:10:37,173 --> 00:10:38,686
If I could borrow...

118
00:10:38,933 --> 00:10:42,403
-..."Satan's Little Helper."
-Santa's Little Helper.

119
00:10:42,653 --> 00:10:47,602
Ladies and gentlemen. You already
know that with a little love...

120
00:10:47,853 --> 00:10:51,528
...any puppy will grow up to be
a bundle of joy.

121
00:10:51,933 --> 00:10:56,484
Nonsense taught by charlatans
and learned by bloody twits!

122
00:10:56,693 --> 00:11:00,686
I'll tell you the most important
words you'll ever hear...

123
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:02,246
...choke chain.

124
00:11:02,493 --> 00:11:07,328
Raise a dog the same as a child,
with simple, authoritative commands.

125
00:11:07,573 --> 00:11:09,131
Lay down!

126
00:11:09,373 --> 00:11:12,763
Followed by immediate correction.

127
00:11:13,013 --> 00:11:15,573
How can we tell we're doing it right?

128
00:11:15,813 --> 00:11:20,568
The dog's eyes will cross,
and his tongue will protrude slightly.

129
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:22,485
Is my dog dead, ma'am?

130
00:11:22,693 --> 00:11:26,083
You don't know how often
I'm asked that.

131
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:28,483
They are always breathing.

132
00:11:28,733 --> 00:11:31,691
Jack, I think the baby might be yours.

133
00:11:31,893 --> 00:11:33,485
I'm sure it is.

134
00:11:33,733 --> 00:11:36,884
-But prove it.
-You treat me like garbage.

135
00:11:37,133 --> 00:11:40,284
Because that's the way
you love it, baby.

136
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:44,722
Gee, is it always this good?

137
00:11:44,973 --> 00:11:47,533
I don't know. I just dip in and out.

138
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:53,769
I'm only watching because Brandy knows
the body is hidden in the boathouse.

139
00:11:54,373 --> 00:11:55,522
That dog!

140
00:11:55,773 --> 00:11:58,162
Bad dog! Don't worry, Snowball.

141
00:12:02,893 --> 00:12:06,727
Mom, what will we do if the dog
doesn't learn anything?

142
00:12:06,973 --> 00:12:08,531
I don't know.

143
00:12:10,453 --> 00:12:13,570
-Father! I thought you were dead.
-I was!

144
00:12:26,773 --> 00:12:31,164
There are two ways for a dog to
relieve himself. One, like a friend.

145
00:12:31,373 --> 00:12:34,046
The other, like a hose
without a fireman.

146
00:12:34,293 --> 00:12:36,807
Which way do you think that was?

147
00:12:37,053 --> 00:12:39,408
Like a hose, you wrinkled queen.

148
00:12:43,373 --> 00:12:45,728
I decided I don't want the shoes.

149
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,326
What happened here?

150
00:12:47,573 --> 00:12:52,488
My dog was bringing me my shoes,
and they fell apart in his mouth.

151
00:12:52,693 --> 00:12:56,242
Our warranty doesn't cover fire,
theft or acts of dog.

152
00:12:59,573 --> 00:13:00,926
Big cookie.

153
00:13:01,173 --> 00:13:02,572
-Aloha.
-Aloha.

154
00:13:02,813 --> 00:13:05,611
-Want a free sample?
-The price is right.

155
00:13:07,133 --> 00:13:09,408
Macamademia nuts.

156
00:13:09,653 --> 00:13:12,042
If you'd like to buy,
they're $1.

157
00:13:12,933 --> 00:13:18,132
So that's your little plan! Get us
addicted, then jack up the price!

158
00:13:18,373 --> 00:13:20,887
Well, you win.

159
00:13:21,173 --> 00:13:22,686
Property...

160
00:13:22,893 --> 00:13:28,445
...of Homer J. Simpson.

161
00:13:28,693 --> 00:13:29,887
Hands off!

162
00:13:41,533 --> 00:13:43,683
Mom, I've finished my patch.

163
00:13:43,893 --> 00:13:48,091
It depicts the two greatest
musical influences in my life.

164
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:51,530
On the left is Mr. Largo,
my music teacher.

165
00:13:51,773 --> 00:13:56,130
He taught that the noblest concerto
can be drained of its beauty.

166
00:13:56,373 --> 00:13:58,887
On the right is Bleeding Gums Murphy.

167
00:13:59,093 --> 00:14:03,006
He taught me that music is a fire
that comes out your mouth.

168
00:14:03,253 --> 00:14:07,883
So you better stick an instrument
in front of it. And look.

169
00:14:26,373 --> 00:14:29,968
I want you to see
what your sick little girl did.

170
00:14:34,533 --> 00:14:37,889
My quilt! Six generations, ruined!

171
00:14:38,133 --> 00:14:40,328
Now, Marge, honey...

172
00:14:41,173 --> 00:14:44,324
...come on, don't get upset.

173
00:14:44,573 --> 00:14:48,327
It's not the end of the world.
We all loved that quilt.

174
00:14:48,573 --> 00:14:51,133
But you can't get too attached to--

175
00:14:51,373 --> 00:14:54,490
My cookie!

176
00:14:55,573 --> 00:14:59,282
This is not happening!

177
00:15:01,573 --> 00:15:03,928
We're having a family meeting!

178
00:15:04,173 --> 00:15:05,765
We never did this before.

179
00:15:05,973 --> 00:15:08,965
We never had a family member
we can give away.

180
00:15:09,573 --> 00:15:12,041
-What are you saying?
-I'm saying--

181
00:15:17,973 --> 00:15:20,282
No! You can't give my dog away!

182
00:15:20,533 --> 00:15:23,172
I'll set fire to my hair,
rip my clothes!

183
00:15:23,813 --> 00:15:26,611
I've suffered at the paws
of this dog...

184
00:15:26,853 --> 00:15:32,211
...but when I look into his vacant
eyes, I can't bear to let him go.

185
00:15:32,413 --> 00:15:34,290
I'm sure Mom agrees with me.

186
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:37,411
No, I'm afraid I agree
with your father.

187
00:15:37,653 --> 00:15:39,723
You do?

188
00:15:39,973 --> 00:15:44,842
Please. It's not just the quilt.
He's nice, but he chews everything.

189
00:15:45,093 --> 00:15:47,243
He's not even housebroken.

190
00:15:47,493 --> 00:15:51,168
We've spent money on training,
with no improvement.

191
00:15:51,413 --> 00:15:56,612
All right. If he studies hard, passes
finals, and becomes a perfect dog...

192
00:15:56,853 --> 00:15:58,650
-...can we keep him?
-No!

193
00:15:58,893 --> 00:16:01,453
-Dad!
-Dad! This is our pet.

194
00:16:01,693 --> 00:16:06,892
We can question his disposition,
but we can't question his heart.

195
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:13,527
Is the way to solve a problem with
something you love to throw it away?

196
00:16:16,093 --> 00:16:21,725
If they're ever going to pull the plug
on me, I want you in my corner.

197
00:16:21,973 --> 00:16:24,965
All right. If he passes,
we can keep him.

198
00:16:25,213 --> 00:16:26,328
All right!

199
00:16:29,173 --> 00:16:32,324
See, boy? It's not so hard.
Roll over.

200
00:16:32,573 --> 00:16:33,642
Roll over.

201
00:16:34,573 --> 00:16:35,608
Like this.

202
00:16:35,853 --> 00:16:38,651
Congratulations, you've earned
a toffee.

203
00:16:38,893 --> 00:16:41,282
Thank you. You moldy old maid.

204
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:45,128
Can't we place this ad after the dog
fails his test?

205
00:16:45,373 --> 00:16:47,329
No, we have to commit to it.

206
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:52,522
Now take this down: Free to loving
home, world's smartest dog.

207
00:16:52,773 --> 00:16:55,162
Says "I love you" on command.

208
00:16:55,413 --> 00:16:57,404
Type.

209
00:16:58,373 --> 00:17:00,762
Now, sit!

210
00:17:01,773 --> 00:17:03,843
I said, sit!

211
00:17:04,373 --> 00:17:07,524
Take a walk.
Sniff that other dog's butt.

212
00:17:07,773 --> 00:17:10,241
See? He does exactly what I say.

213
00:17:10,493 --> 00:17:15,089
We'd never give him away, but
we're moving, and dogs are forbidden.

214
00:17:15,733 --> 00:17:18,122
Hear what? Oh, sure.

215
00:17:18,373 --> 00:17:23,083
Come here, boy! Put that prowler down
and come here! Come on!

216
00:17:23,693 --> 00:17:26,332
Say "I love you" for the nice man.

217
00:17:27,893 --> 00:17:32,569
Good dog! Isn't that amazing?
See you soon.

218
00:17:33,893 --> 00:17:36,805
You think your dogs
know the "stay" command.

219
00:17:37,053 --> 00:17:41,126
Let's see if they can stay away
from this beef Wellington.

220
00:17:41,373 --> 00:17:44,683
Now, stay.

221
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:47,527
Stay, boy! Stay!

222
00:17:47,773 --> 00:17:51,482
Stay!

223
00:17:53,093 --> 00:17:57,530
He'd be happy at my farm. People think
only mules can pull carts.

224
00:17:57,773 --> 00:18:01,561
Impatient people think that,
patient people know better.

225
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:04,091
You can take him tomorrow.

226
00:18:08,373 --> 00:18:11,410
Miss Winthrop, I was thinking.

227
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:17,211
-Oh, dear.
-Since you get paid either way...

228
00:18:17,413 --> 00:18:21,008
...would it be a big deal
to just let my dog pass?

229
00:18:21,253 --> 00:18:25,246
I see. Rubber stamp, thank you,
next in line. Is that it?

230
00:18:25,493 --> 00:18:28,087
-Yeah.
-Heavens to murgatroid.

231
00:18:28,933 --> 00:18:32,721
Perhaps I cling to the old ways
like a well-chewed shoe...

232
00:18:32,973 --> 00:18:38,889
...as the traditions I was weaned on
are put to sleep, one by one.

233
00:18:39,133 --> 00:18:42,125
But my time has not passed yet!

234
00:18:42,373 --> 00:18:47,447
We do not need another college
graduate who doesn't know how to sit!

235
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:49,285
He'll sit!

236
00:18:49,533 --> 00:18:52,047
Come on, boy. Sit!

237
00:18:54,453 --> 00:18:55,772
Pull the chain!

238
00:18:56,013 --> 00:18:57,446
Correct the dog!

239
00:18:57,693 --> 00:19:02,642
-I don't want to strangle my dog.
-Pull the bloody chain, boy!

240
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:08,847
I'm sorry. You can't help being dumb.

241
00:19:09,973 --> 00:19:12,726
-What are you doing?
-Sewing a new quilt.

242
00:19:12,973 --> 00:19:17,808
It's one thing to be a link
in a chain. It's another to start one.

243
00:19:18,053 --> 00:19:22,092
This patch commemorates
the destruction of the old quilt.

244
00:19:22,293 --> 00:19:27,083
Well, you certainly captured
the moment.

245
00:19:27,573 --> 00:19:30,690
Come on, boy. Sit!

246
00:19:31,493 --> 00:19:32,482
Sit!

247
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:38,052
-Sit! Oh, man.
-Bart, he's not gonna learn it now.

248
00:19:38,293 --> 00:19:41,649
Don't spend your last hours together
tormenting him.

249
00:19:41,893 --> 00:19:44,123
Have some fun. Frolic with him.

250
00:19:45,973 --> 00:19:47,804
Go get it, boy!

251
00:20:08,573 --> 00:20:10,484
I'm gonna miss you, boy.

252
00:20:10,693 --> 00:20:13,253
I thought we'd be pals forever.

253
00:20:13,773 --> 00:20:19,962
But we have to say goodbye because
you don't understand a word I say.

254
00:20:20,493 --> 00:20:22,723
If you knew how to learn--

255
00:20:23,293 --> 00:20:25,488
Sit.

256
00:20:25,733 --> 00:20:28,691
Wait a minute, you did it!

257
00:20:31,093 --> 00:20:33,288
Lay down.

258
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:36,047
Shake hands.

259
00:20:36,293 --> 00:20:38,045
Stay!

260
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:40,289
Speak!

261
00:20:40,533 --> 00:20:42,285
All right! Good boy!

262
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:45,093
Roll over.

263
00:20:45,973 --> 00:20:51,093
You son of a bitch! Good show!

264
00:20:55,573 --> 00:20:57,564
All right!

265
00:22:15,053 --> 00:22:16,008
