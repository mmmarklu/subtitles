1
00:00:05,573 --> 00:00:07,370
Oh Brother, Where Art Thou

2
00:00:51,493 --> 00:00:55,771
Let's move on to new business.
Have you taken care of McBain?

3
00:00:55,973 --> 00:01:01,366
Don't worry, Senator Mendoza. By now
our dear friend has met with a...

4
00:01:01,573 --> 00:01:05,088
...shall we say,
unfortunate accident?

5
00:01:06,293 --> 00:01:10,332
Great. With McBain out of the way,
nothing can stop us!

6
00:01:10,573 --> 00:01:13,007
Any more new business?

7
00:01:13,213 --> 00:01:16,011
-Only your death!
-McBain!

8
00:01:26,733 --> 00:01:28,212
McBain!

9
00:01:32,413 --> 00:01:33,687
Meeting adjourned.

10
00:01:33,933 --> 00:01:36,288
-$2.50 for this?
-What a gyp!

11
00:01:36,533 --> 00:01:38,569
You broke up that meeting.

12
00:01:38,773 --> 00:01:42,732
Now I'm thinking about holding
another meeting in bed.

13
00:01:42,973 --> 00:01:45,487
Oh, McBain!

14
00:01:56,213 --> 00:02:00,365
I want to see the manager!

15
00:02:00,573 --> 00:02:03,041
-The screen's small!
-The floor's sticky!

16
00:02:03,253 --> 00:02:06,689
-The subplot felt tacked on.
-We demand a refund!

17
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:09,612
-It's not our policy.
-I'll policy you!

18
00:02:09,813 --> 00:02:13,931
-Don't have a heart attack, old dude.
-Don't you tell me...

19
00:02:14,173 --> 00:02:16,607
...what to do, you...

20
00:02:16,853 --> 00:02:18,730
...young whipper...

21
00:02:19,453 --> 00:02:21,125
...snapper!

22
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:27,283
Thanks for nuclear power, which is yet
to cause a single proven fatality...

23
00:02:27,533 --> 00:02:31,242
-...at least in this country. Amen.
-Very nicely said.

24
00:02:31,453 --> 00:02:35,685
-Bart ate during the blessing!
-You opened your eyes.

25
00:02:35,893 --> 00:02:37,565
-Eating is worse.
-Is not!

26
00:02:37,773 --> 00:02:39,172
-Is too!
-Is not!

27
00:02:39,373 --> 00:02:42,331
One more word and
Bart gets no cartoons...

28
00:02:42,573 --> 00:02:44,643
...and Lisa can't go to college!

29
00:02:44,853 --> 00:02:47,048
-Dad!
-Not one word!

30
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:03,043
-Knock it off.
-We didn't talk.

31
00:03:03,253 --> 00:03:05,847
-Not a word.
-No panto-ma-mine, either.

32
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:10,922
-Telephone, Homer. It's the hospital.
-The hospital? Hello?

33
00:03:11,173 --> 00:03:12,606
Oh, my God!

34
00:03:12,813 --> 00:03:16,601
I'm happy to say that he
only had a mild arrhythmia.

35
00:03:16,813 --> 00:03:21,091
Mild! There wasn't anything
mild about it!

36
00:03:21,293 --> 00:03:24,205
Now get back
to the pharmacy, you quack!

37
00:03:25,373 --> 00:03:31,084
With that feisty attitude,
you'll bury us all, Grampa Simpson.

38
00:03:31,573 --> 00:03:35,532
-Pull your chair closer, my son.
-What is it, Dad?

39
00:03:35,773 --> 00:03:38,412
Not that close!

40
00:03:38,613 --> 00:03:44,643
Homer, that heart attack made me
realize that I'm going to die someday.

41
00:03:44,853 --> 00:03:47,242
Oh, Dad! You and your imagination.

42
00:03:47,453 --> 00:03:52,049
There's something I think you
should know. You have a half-brother.

43
00:03:52,253 --> 00:03:54,130
A half-brother?

44
00:03:54,373 --> 00:03:58,491
It all happened while
I was courting your mother.

45
00:03:58,693 --> 00:04:03,130
I was checking out the skirts at
the carnival when I first saw her.

46
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:06,643
Hey, handsome, wanna dunk the clown?

47
00:04:06,853 --> 00:04:11,881
She did things your mother would
never do. Like have sex for money.

48
00:04:12,093 --> 00:04:14,926
A year later,
the carnival came back...

49
00:04:15,173 --> 00:04:18,722
...and she had
a little surprise for me.

50
00:04:18,973 --> 00:04:24,127
We left the baby at the Shelbyville
orphanage, and I never saw him again.

51
00:04:24,373 --> 00:04:27,922
A year later, I married your mother
and we had you.

52
00:04:28,133 --> 00:04:31,364
I want Homer to grow up
respecting his father.

53
00:04:31,573 --> 00:04:35,361
He must never know about
that carnival incident.

54
00:04:35,573 --> 00:04:38,007
-Promise you won't tell.
-I promise.

55
00:04:38,693 --> 00:04:41,082
Forget what I just told you.

56
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:44,882
-Why are you blubbering?
-This makes me feel special.

57
00:04:45,133 --> 00:04:49,012
Since I'm the one you kept,
it means you really love me.

58
00:04:49,213 --> 00:04:52,523
-Interesting theory.
-I'm going to find my brother.

59
00:04:52,773 --> 00:04:57,085
If I have to move heaven and earth,
I'm going to find him!

60
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:59,688
Yeah, right. Good luck.

61
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,931
A long-Iost half-brother.
How Dickensian!

62
00:05:03,173 --> 00:05:07,086
Know where this bastard lives?
His parents aren't married.

63
00:05:07,293 --> 00:05:11,206
-It's the correct word, isn't it?
-He's got us there.

64
00:05:11,413 --> 00:05:14,166
-Bastard! Bastard! Bastard!
-Bart!

65
00:05:14,373 --> 00:05:16,011
-Bart!
-Bastard!

66
00:05:17,373 --> 00:05:18,726
2-1 -4-8, this is it.

67
00:05:18,933 --> 00:05:22,562
-Excuse me, is this an orphanage?
-You're a little late.

68
00:05:22,773 --> 00:05:27,688
-They tore that down 30 years ago.
-Thirty years! I'll never find him!

69
00:05:27,893 --> 00:05:31,363
I'm doomed to walk through
this life alone.

70
00:05:32,973 --> 00:05:36,488
Oh, brother, where art thou?

71
00:05:36,693 --> 00:05:40,368
-Easy. They moved across the street.
-Sorry.

72
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:42,643
I know how you feel.

73
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:47,211
I've spent years searching
for my long-Iost twin brother--

74
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:50,883
Yeah, but we're looking
for my brother today.

75
00:05:51,093 --> 00:05:53,129
Can you tell me his name?

76
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:58,009
Our records state the Powells
adopted him and named him Herbert.

77
00:05:58,213 --> 00:06:01,364
Herbert Powell, great!
Where can I find him?

78
00:06:01,573 --> 00:06:03,882
Sorry, I'm not allowed to say.

79
00:06:04,093 --> 00:06:07,722
Please! This is my life
we're talking about here!

80
00:06:07,973 --> 00:06:11,329
I do sympathize
with your situation, Mr. Simpson.

81
00:06:11,573 --> 00:06:14,929
Your brother could be anywhere,
even Detroit.

82
00:06:15,173 --> 00:06:19,291
I know he could be anywhere!
Narrow it down, please!

83
00:06:19,493 --> 00:06:20,926
If you ask me...

84
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:25,451
...the city of brotherly love
isn't Philadelphia, it's Detroit.

85
00:06:25,653 --> 00:06:31,330
Changing the subject makes you a
worthless excuse for a human being--

86
00:06:31,573 --> 00:06:33,882
Read between the lines, you fool!

87
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:39,725
I get it! Here's 20 bucks. Now, will
you tell me where my brother lives?

88
00:06:39,973 --> 00:06:42,123
-I don't--
-Take it and tell me!

89
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:45,131
-He lives in Detroit.
-Fine. Thank you.

90
00:06:45,653 --> 00:06:48,167
Let's see, Powell....

91
00:06:48,893 --> 00:06:52,488
"Pomerantz." "Poole."
"Popkin." "Potter."

92
00:06:52,693 --> 00:06:55,127
"Quigley." "Quimby." "Randolph."

93
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:59,002
Oops, too far.
Here it is, "Powell" !

94
00:07:10,693 --> 00:07:11,921
-Any luck?
-No.

95
00:07:12,133 --> 00:07:15,205
I called all three
Herbert Powells, nothing.

96
00:07:15,573 --> 00:07:18,531
Well, you want to try
that H. Powell?

97
00:07:18,773 --> 00:07:22,686
"H" ! Of course!
That could stand for Herbert!

98
00:07:22,893 --> 00:07:25,282
It's a long shot, but--

99
00:07:27,773 --> 00:07:30,970
Is this H. Powell
of Detroit, Michigan?

100
00:07:31,173 --> 00:07:34,165
By any chance does the "H" stand
for Herbert?

101
00:07:35,493 --> 00:07:39,486
The "H" stands for Herbert!
Herb, were you adopted?

102
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:42,969
-From the Shelbyville Orphanage?
-How did you know?

103
00:07:43,173 --> 00:07:47,086
Because I'm your baby brother, Homer!

104
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:52,723
-Hello? Hello? Stupid phone!
-Knock it off! I'm here!

105
00:07:52,933 --> 00:07:55,766
-I was silent due to emotion.
-Sorry.

106
00:07:55,973 --> 00:07:57,406
We need to meet.

107
00:07:57,613 --> 00:08:01,845
Grab a plane to Springfield.
We got a couch that folds out--

108
00:08:02,053 --> 00:08:05,887
I'll tell you what,
why don't you come here?

109
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:11,370
-Are we there yet?
-Just a little further.

110
00:08:11,573 --> 00:08:14,007
-We there yet?
-Just a little further!

111
00:08:14,253 --> 00:08:17,689
If you don't behave
we'll turn around and go home.

112
00:08:17,893 --> 00:08:23,843
-But, Marge, I want to see my brother!
-Homer, it's an empty threat.

113
00:08:28,613 --> 00:08:30,888
Did you know you were going--?

114
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:33,766
Sorry, sir, I didn't know it was you.

115
00:08:34,173 --> 00:08:39,327
That's okay. Carry on.
See the way I handled that, Marge?

116
00:08:43,733 --> 00:08:47,248
-What are you doing here?
-What does it look like?

117
00:08:54,173 --> 00:08:56,733
We're losing to the Japanese. Why?

118
00:08:56,933 --> 00:09:00,926
-Unfair trade practices?
-Mushy one-worlders in Washington?

119
00:09:01,133 --> 00:09:03,886
-Some gypsy curse?
-I'm tired of excuses!

120
00:09:04,093 --> 00:09:07,085
-Why did I hire Harvard idiots?
-You went there.

121
00:09:07,293 --> 00:09:10,126
But Mommy and Daddy didn't pay my way!

122
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:13,848
I had to work,
washing your dishes and toilets!

123
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,372
I remember you.

124
00:09:15,573 --> 00:09:20,408
-What's the name for our new car?
-You'll love this. The Persephone!

125
00:09:20,613 --> 00:09:24,242
Persephone?
What the hell kind of name is that?

126
00:09:24,453 --> 00:09:28,162
She was the Greek goddess
of spring and rebirth.

127
00:09:28,373 --> 00:09:33,163
She was carried off to Hades
where she ate six pomegranate s--

128
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:37,525
People don't want cars named
after hungry, old, Greek broads!

129
00:09:37,733 --> 00:09:43,126
They want names like Mustang
and Cheetah, vicious animal names.

130
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:47,929
The problem is, you've forgotten
your roots! What are your roots?

131
00:09:48,133 --> 00:09:52,490
I guess they extend to
when the Angles met the Saxons.

132
00:09:52,733 --> 00:09:54,485
When white met bread.

133
00:09:54,693 --> 00:09:57,890
What are your roots?
What can they teach us?

134
00:09:58,453 --> 00:10:02,287
I have no roots.
All I know is that...

135
00:10:02,493 --> 00:10:05,803
...I'm just a Ionely guy.

136
00:10:07,213 --> 00:10:10,330
-What was he so upset about?
-Good Lord.

137
00:10:10,533 --> 00:10:14,685
Marge, this can't
be the right address.

138
00:10:16,733 --> 00:10:19,122
-Hello, in there.
-Homer?

139
00:10:20,493 --> 00:10:23,405
-Herb?
-You look just like--

140
00:10:23,613 --> 00:10:25,683
Except you got a little more--

141
00:10:25,893 --> 00:10:27,531
And a little less--

142
00:10:27,773 --> 00:10:29,889
God, I feel so--

143
00:10:30,093 --> 00:10:32,288
-Herbert!
-Homer!

144
00:10:34,293 --> 00:10:38,923
-Welcome to my home, brother.
-Holy moly! The bastard's rich!

145
00:10:39,133 --> 00:10:44,287
Herb, allow me to introduce my family.
This is my wife, Marge.

146
00:10:44,693 --> 00:10:48,083
-You old dog, she's gorgeous!
-Thank you.

147
00:10:48,293 --> 00:10:51,285
Our three children,
Bart, Lisa and Maggie.

148
00:10:51,533 --> 00:10:53,091
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.

149
00:10:53,293 --> 00:10:56,763
-All born in wedlock?
-Yes, but Bart was a close call.

150
00:10:56,973 --> 00:11:01,091
Lisa, are you the hell-raiser
your father told me about?

151
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:04,763
-No, I can assure you I'm not.
-I'm the hell-raiser.

152
00:11:04,973 --> 00:11:08,124
-Do you want to hold the baby?
-I don't know how.

153
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:12,690
Oh, what's to know?
Just dive in. Catch!

154
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:18,885
God, that new-baby smell.
Homer, you're the richest man I know.

155
00:11:19,293 --> 00:11:21,249
I feel the same about you.

156
00:11:21,453 --> 00:11:24,286
I want you to make yourselves at home.

157
00:11:24,493 --> 00:11:29,442
Any time you're hungry, day or night,
Cook will make you anything you want.

158
00:11:29,653 --> 00:11:33,532
-Even pork chops?
-Absolutely. We've a tennis court--

159
00:11:33,773 --> 00:11:38,722
If I want pork chops in the middle
of the night, he'll fry them up?

160
00:11:38,973 --> 00:11:42,488
Sure. That's what he's paid for.
If you need towels--

161
00:11:42,733 --> 00:11:48,524
Wait! Let me see if I got this right.
It's Christmas day, 4:00 a.m...

162
00:11:48,733 --> 00:11:51,805
-...there's a rumble in my belly--
-Homer!

163
00:11:52,013 --> 00:11:55,767
-You sure love pork chops!
-He sure does, Uncle Herb.

164
00:11:56,493 --> 00:12:01,613
"Uncle Herb" sounds so formal. Do you
think you could call me "Unky Herb"?

165
00:12:01,813 --> 00:12:06,648
-No problemo, Unky Herb.
-He's adorable. My nephew's adorable.

166
00:12:06,853 --> 00:12:09,572
-Marco!
-Polo.

167
00:12:09,773 --> 00:12:11,525
Will you kids shut up?

168
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:14,287
So, Marge, a little about yourself.

169
00:12:14,493 --> 00:12:19,886
I met Homer in high school. We married
and had three beautiful children.

170
00:12:20,093 --> 00:12:23,324
Wow, we have so much
catching up to do.

171
00:12:23,573 --> 00:12:26,406
I just told you
pretty much everything.

172
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:30,049
-Watch me dive!
-Okay, we're watching!

173
00:12:30,253 --> 00:12:32,687
I hope we're not spoiling them.

174
00:12:32,893 --> 00:12:35,612
-You weren't watching!
-You didn't see!

175
00:12:43,773 --> 00:12:46,685
A millionaire!
I kept the wrong one.

176
00:12:46,893 --> 00:12:49,532
I'll come as soon
as I can leave here.

177
00:12:49,773 --> 00:12:54,005
In the meantime,
please don't do anything stupid.

178
00:12:59,013 --> 00:13:01,208
Can I spit over the side?

179
00:13:01,893 --> 00:13:05,681
I love this kid.
Hawk your brains out.

180
00:13:07,373 --> 00:13:09,045
Got him!

181
00:13:10,093 --> 00:13:13,608
Cook? Sorry to bother you,
but I got a hankering for--

182
00:13:13,853 --> 00:13:16,208
That's right! With applesauce.

183
00:13:18,453 --> 00:13:22,924
-Pick out any one you want.
-You sure you want to give me a car?

184
00:13:23,173 --> 00:13:28,293
You know what they cost me? There's
maybe $40 worth of steel in them.

185
00:13:28,533 --> 00:13:32,685
-Okay, I'd like a big one then.
-We don't have a big one.

186
00:13:32,893 --> 00:13:35,566
-Why not?
-Americans don't want big cars.

187
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:39,322
-Give me one with lots of pep.
-Our cars don't have pep.

188
00:13:39,533 --> 00:13:42,445
-Why not?
-Americans want good mileage.

189
00:13:42,653 --> 00:13:45,884
Tell the nice man
what country you come from.

190
00:13:46,093 --> 00:13:48,288
-America.
-You hear that, morons?

191
00:13:48,493 --> 00:13:50,723
This is why we're getting killed!

192
00:13:50,973 --> 00:13:55,888
Instead of listening,
you're telling people what they want.

193
00:13:56,093 --> 00:13:57,924
-I need your help.
-You do?

194
00:13:58,173 --> 00:14:04,043
Yeah. I want you
to help me design a car.

195
00:14:04,373 --> 00:14:07,251
A car for all
the Homer Simpsons out there.

196
00:14:07,453 --> 00:14:12,811
-I want to pay you $200,000 a year!
-And I want to let you!

197
00:14:13,973 --> 00:14:18,125
Homer, meet my team of engineers.
They're gonna build your car.

198
00:14:18,373 --> 00:14:22,127
-Hi, team.
-This project is our top priority.

199
00:14:22,373 --> 00:14:25,729
I don't want to see anything
till it's finished.

200
00:14:25,973 --> 00:14:27,486
But, sir--

201
00:14:28,173 --> 00:14:31,324
Direct all your questions
to Mr. Simpson...

202
00:14:31,573 --> 00:14:36,124
...the man with the vision. He'll bust
this company out of its rut.

203
00:14:36,373 --> 00:14:39,843
He'll change American
transportation forever!

204
00:14:40,253 --> 00:14:44,212
-So, what kind of car would you like?
-I don't know.

205
00:14:44,413 --> 00:14:47,325
Whatever you kids want
to do today, tell me.

206
00:14:47,573 --> 00:14:49,928
-Oh, dear.
-I want a pony ride.

207
00:14:50,173 --> 00:14:52,368
-I want a boat ride.
-Pony ride!

208
00:14:52,573 --> 00:14:55,087
-Boat ride!
-Pony ride!

209
00:14:56,693 --> 00:14:58,809
Ahoy, mateys!

210
00:15:00,053 --> 00:15:04,843
-Kids are so easy to please.
-I hope we're not spoiling them.

211
00:15:05,893 --> 00:15:08,282
-What's that?
-The onboard computer.

212
00:15:08,493 --> 00:15:10,290
All right.
What's that?

213
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:15,521
-Your brother told you to help us.
-Yeah, he did.

214
00:15:15,773 --> 00:15:19,607
-Why don't you get us some coffee?
-Okay.

215
00:15:19,853 --> 00:15:23,687
Batting ninth, Unky Herb!

216
00:15:24,813 --> 00:15:26,883
-Oh, boy.
-How's your car coming?

217
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:31,644
We're putting in an onboard something
and rack-and-peanut steering....

218
00:15:31,853 --> 00:15:36,131
Homer, you didn't ask for
rack-and-pinion steering, did you?

219
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:37,766
I think I did.

220
00:15:37,973 --> 00:15:41,727
How could you ask for it?
You don't know what it is.

221
00:15:41,933 --> 00:15:45,767
-May I be excused?
-No. You know why I gave you this job?

222
00:15:46,013 --> 00:15:48,732
-You think I'm a genius?
-No, not that.

223
00:15:48,973 --> 00:15:51,726
-You think I'm dynamic?
-I don't think so.

224
00:15:51,933 --> 00:15:54,493
-You think I work well with others?
-No.

225
00:15:54,693 --> 00:15:57,366
It's because you're an average schmo.

226
00:15:57,573 --> 00:16:01,486
-All you need is self-confidence.
-Unky Herb, I don't know--

227
00:16:01,693 --> 00:16:07,131
Listen to me. From now on, before you
say anything, say to yourself:

228
00:16:07,373 --> 00:16:10,285
"If nothing else, I'm sure of this!"

229
00:16:10,493 --> 00:16:12,051
-Understand?
-Sort of.

230
00:16:12,253 --> 00:16:13,322
-Homer!
-What?

231
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:16,133
-Answer with self-confidence.
-Sort of!

232
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:18,893
Now go get them!

233
00:16:19,093 --> 00:16:22,324
I want a place in this car
to put my drink!

234
00:16:22,533 --> 00:16:26,128
-Sir, the car has a beverage holder.
-Hello, Einstein!

235
00:16:26,373 --> 00:16:28,523
I said a place to put my drink.

236
00:16:28,773 --> 00:16:32,686
The Super Slakers they sell
at K wik-E-Marts are this big!

237
00:16:32,933 --> 00:16:35,493
-Very big beverage holder.
-I'm not done!

238
00:16:35,693 --> 00:16:40,130
The little ball you put on the aerial
so you can find your car.

239
00:16:40,373 --> 00:16:41,692
Little ball.

240
00:16:41,893 --> 00:16:46,125
Some things are so snazzy they never
go out of style. Tail fins...

241
00:16:46,373 --> 00:16:49,604
-...and bubble domes....
-I gotta call the boss.

242
00:16:49,893 --> 00:16:53,932
Hello. Well, you know what?
I'm glad you're nervous...

243
00:16:54,173 --> 00:16:57,483
...because that means we're
on the right track.

244
00:17:00,173 --> 00:17:04,803
All right! This is what you're
gonna do. Hang up and call me back.

245
00:17:05,053 --> 00:17:09,843
Say the exact opposite of everything
you just said. Kids, come here.

246
00:17:10,053 --> 00:17:13,887
-What is it?
-Hear what the guys think of your dad.

247
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:18,126
-Hello.
-Homer Simpson is a brilliant man...

248
00:17:18,373 --> 00:17:22,082
... with lots of well-thought-out,
practical ideas.

249
00:17:22,293 --> 00:17:25,888
He's ensuring the financial security
of this company.

250
00:17:26,133 --> 00:17:29,921
Oh, yes, and his personal hygiene
is above reproach.

251
00:17:30,173 --> 00:17:33,290
-Our dad's the greatest!
-Homer, I'm impressed!

252
00:17:33,533 --> 00:17:35,205
Pretty good, huh?

253
00:17:35,773 --> 00:17:39,925
Put a horn here, here and here.
I can't find it when I'm mad.

254
00:17:40,173 --> 00:17:43,882
-And they should play "La Cucaracha."
-Can do.

255
00:17:44,133 --> 00:17:47,125
Sometimes the kids
are in the back hollering.

256
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:50,405
There must be
something we can do about that.

257
00:17:50,613 --> 00:17:52,524
A built-in video game?

258
00:17:52,733 --> 00:17:55,531
You're fired!
What are we paying you for?

259
00:17:55,733 --> 00:18:00,727
A separate soundproof dome for
the kids? With restraints and muzzles.

260
00:18:00,933 --> 00:18:03,401
Bull's-eye! And when I
gun the motor...

261
00:18:03,613 --> 00:18:07,891
...I want people to think the world
is coming to an end!

262
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:12,722
The mouse is named Itchy
and the cat is Scratchy.

263
00:18:12,933 --> 00:18:15,493
-They hate each other.
-They express it.

264
00:18:15,733 --> 00:18:16,722
Good.

265
00:18:32,173 --> 00:18:36,325
To think I wasted my life
in boardrooms and meetings.

266
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:39,133
I could have been watching cartoons!

267
00:18:39,373 --> 00:18:42,888
This old fool's wasted his life.

268
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:59,211
-Do you miss the Antarctic?
-Now this is spoiling them.

269
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:03,286
No.

270
00:19:12,773 --> 00:19:16,083
Ladies and gentlemen,
esteemed stockholders...

271
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:19,723
...members of the press,
Your Holiness.

272
00:19:19,973 --> 00:19:24,888
Tonight we are going
to witness automotive history.

273
00:19:25,093 --> 00:19:27,482
Whatever Homer wants...

274
00:19:27,693 --> 00:19:31,129
All my life, I've looked
for a car that feels right.

275
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,210
...Homer gets

276
00:19:33,413 --> 00:19:37,088
Powerful like a gorilla,
yet soft like a Nerf ball.

277
00:19:37,293 --> 00:19:38,772
Now I've found it.

278
00:19:41,053 --> 00:19:45,331
Presenting the car designed
for the average man...

279
00:19:45,573 --> 00:19:47,291
...the Homer!

280
00:19:53,253 --> 00:19:56,290
-Questions?
-What does this monstrosity cost?

281
00:19:56,533 --> 00:20:00,082
Jerry, what's the sticker price?

282
00:20:00,293 --> 00:20:02,932
$82,000!

283
00:20:03,173 --> 00:20:07,928
This monstrosity costs $82,000?

284
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:11,529
What have I done?
I mean, the zoo was fun...

285
00:20:11,773 --> 00:20:14,162
...but I'm ruined!

286
00:20:20,293 --> 00:20:22,727
-Bye, Unky Herb.
-Goodbye, Herb.

287
00:20:22,933 --> 00:20:28,132
Because of me, you lost your business,
your home and all your possessions.

288
00:20:28,373 --> 00:20:33,083
Maybe you'd have been better off
if I'd never come into your life.

289
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:36,131
Maybe I'd have been better off?
Maybe?

290
00:20:36,373 --> 00:20:40,048
You sponge-head,
of course I'd have been better off!

291
00:20:40,253 --> 00:20:44,371
As far as I'm concerned,
I have no brother!

292
00:20:44,773 --> 00:20:47,606
Maybe he said that
to make conversation.

293
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:52,682
His life was an unbridled success
until he found out he was a Simpson.

294
00:20:54,373 --> 00:20:59,401
I'm here! Where's that millionaire
chip off the old block I call sonny?

295
00:20:59,613 --> 00:21:02,810
Get in, Dad.
I'll explain on the way home.

296
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:06,090
I knew you'd blow it!

297
00:21:07,973 --> 00:21:09,929
-Dad?
-What is it, boy?

298
00:21:10,133 --> 00:21:12,203
I thought your car was cool.

299
00:21:12,413 --> 00:21:16,201
Thanks, boy. I was
waiting for someone to say that.
