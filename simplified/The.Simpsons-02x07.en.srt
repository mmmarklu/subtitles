1
00:00:05,573 --> 00:00:07,370
Bart vs. Thanksgiving

2
00:01:40,613 --> 00:01:42,922
Stop fighting with your sister!

3
00:01:43,173 --> 00:01:47,769
-She took my glue!
-It's not yours! This is family glue!

4
00:01:48,013 --> 00:01:49,924
Stop it! This is Thanksgiving!

5
00:01:50,173 --> 00:01:53,722
So glue friendly,
or I'll take your glue away!

6
00:01:53,973 --> 00:01:56,009
This isn't about glue.

7
00:01:56,213 --> 00:01:59,569
He only wants the glue
because I'm using it.

8
00:01:59,813 --> 00:02:01,644
-Oh, yeah? Prove it!
-Here.

9
00:02:01,893 --> 00:02:04,726
Hey, man, I don't want
your stupid glue.

10
00:02:07,893 --> 00:02:11,090
Here comes our friend,
Bullwinkle J. Moose.

11
00:02:11,293 --> 00:02:13,807
Bullwinkle's antler's sprung a leak.

12
00:02:14,013 --> 00:02:16,652
Bullwinkle got a taste
of his own medicine.

13
00:02:16,893 --> 00:02:20,010
-He certainly did, Bill.
-Wait, what did--?

14
00:02:20,253 --> 00:02:22,926
-Did that make sense?
-Not really, Bill.

15
00:02:23,133 --> 00:02:26,409
-Now I know how the Pilgrims felt.
-What?

16
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:28,729
-Who the hell is that?
-Bullwinkle.

17
00:02:28,933 --> 00:02:32,846
-Who's that?
-Underdog. Don't you know anything?

18
00:02:33,053 --> 00:02:36,329
They should use cartoons
made in the last 50 years.

19
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:37,847
This is a tradition.

20
00:02:38,093 --> 00:02:41,927
If you build a balloon
for every cartoon character...

21
00:02:42,173 --> 00:02:44,641
...you'll turn the parade
into a farce.

22
00:02:55,053 --> 00:02:58,329
Maggie! I'm about to unveil
my centerpiece.

23
00:02:58,533 --> 00:03:02,048
It's a tribute to the women
who made our country great.

24
00:03:02,293 --> 00:03:05,842
See, there's Georgia O'Keeffe,
Susan B. Anthony...

25
00:03:06,093 --> 00:03:08,653
...and this
is Marjory Stoneman Douglas.

26
00:03:08,893 --> 00:03:13,364
She worked her whole life
to preserve the Florida Everglades.

27
00:03:13,613 --> 00:03:17,162
Would you like to contribute
something to it?

28
00:03:20,213 --> 00:03:22,124
Oh, thank you.

29
00:03:23,173 --> 00:03:25,767
-Honey, you're in the way.
-Can't I help?

30
00:03:26,013 --> 00:03:29,244
Well, okay.
Can you do the cranberry sauce?

31
00:03:29,453 --> 00:03:30,932
Yeah! Where is it?

32
00:03:31,133 --> 00:03:33,727
-The can is in the cupboard.
-Here?

33
00:03:33,973 --> 00:03:37,568
-No, the other shelf.
-Got it. Now what?

34
00:03:37,813 --> 00:03:40,850
-Open the can.
-Where's the can opener?

35
00:03:41,053 --> 00:03:45,763
It's in the second drawer from
the right. No, no, the other one.

36
00:03:46,213 --> 00:03:47,407
Oh, I got you.

37
00:03:49,373 --> 00:03:51,728
It's broken, Mom. Mom, it's broken.

38
00:03:51,973 --> 00:03:55,568
Mom, it's broken
Mom, it's broken

39
00:03:55,813 --> 00:03:59,931
I don't think that it's broken.
Here, let me try.

40
00:04:00,133 --> 00:04:02,124
Here you go.

41
00:04:05,093 --> 00:04:07,732
Cranberry sauce ?la Bart.

42
00:04:07,933 --> 00:04:12,927
Just stick it in the refrigerator
when you're done, Bart. Bart?

43
00:04:15,813 --> 00:04:19,931
Those silver-and-blue guys
are the Dallas Cowboys.

44
00:04:20,133 --> 00:04:22,328
They're Daddy's favorite team.

45
00:04:22,533 --> 00:04:25,843
He wants them to lose
by less than five points.

46
00:04:26,093 --> 00:04:30,405
Kogen's got Wolodarsky open way
down field. Oh, what a hit!

47
00:04:30,613 --> 00:04:32,763
-Yeah, he's out cold, Gil.
-Yes.

48
00:04:33,013 --> 00:04:35,527
They'll feed him dinner
through a tube.

49
00:04:35,773 --> 00:04:38,162
Hope they can fit a turkey in there.

50
00:04:38,413 --> 00:04:42,167
-Homer, you should pick up Grandpa.
-Halftime, Marge.

51
00:04:42,373 --> 00:04:44,170
Here comes the cavalry.

52
00:04:44,893 --> 00:04:48,886
-You promised to be nice to my sisters.
-I know, I will.

53
00:04:53,133 --> 00:04:57,172
-You brought food?
-Just a few things. Swedish meatballs.

54
00:04:57,413 --> 00:05:01,770
-And my trout almondine.
-You knew I was cooking a turkey.

55
00:05:02,013 --> 00:05:04,129
-Which is fine.
-More power to you.

56
00:05:04,373 --> 00:05:07,649
Some people find your turkey
a little dry.

57
00:05:07,853 --> 00:05:09,730
Now they'll have an option.

58
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:15,409
Hi, Patty. Hi, Selma.

59
00:05:16,053 --> 00:05:20,012
It's good to see you.
Gotta pick up my old man! Bye!

60
00:05:20,213 --> 00:05:23,046
-So insincere.
-How does she put up with him?

61
00:05:30,013 --> 00:05:33,528
And now, get set for
our fabulous halftime show...

62
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:37,965
...featuring the young go-getters
of Hurray for Everything!

63
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:41,523
I love those kids!
They got such a great attitude!

64
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:44,645
Ladies and gentlemen,
Hurray for Everything...

65
00:05:44,853 --> 00:05:50,325
...invites you to join them in
a salute to the greatest hemisphere...

66
00:05:50,573 --> 00:05:54,532
...the Western hemisphere!
The dancing-est hemisphere!

67
00:06:06,973 --> 00:06:10,568
Before we sit down to our
delicious turkey pur...

68
00:06:10,773 --> 00:06:12,365
...I have happy news.

69
00:06:12,613 --> 00:06:16,128
These people have relatives
who wish they could be here:

70
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:22,329
Antonowski, Conroy, Falcone,
Martin, Thorsen, and Walsh.

71
00:06:23,733 --> 00:06:27,362
Oh, and Mrs. Spencer, you too.

72
00:06:27,613 --> 00:06:30,286
Oh, I knew they wouldn't forget me.

73
00:06:30,493 --> 00:06:33,963
-Dad, let's get out of here.
-What's your hurry?

74
00:06:34,173 --> 00:06:37,006
-This place is depressing.
-Hey, I live here!

75
00:06:37,213 --> 00:06:41,650
Well, I'm sure it's a blast
once you get used to it.

76
00:06:52,493 --> 00:06:55,565
Mom, you made it! How are you?!

77
00:06:55,813 --> 00:07:01,683
I have laryngitis and it hurts
to talk, so I'll just say one thing:

78
00:07:01,893 --> 00:07:03,929
You never do anything right.

79
00:07:14,013 --> 00:07:16,766
-Thank you!
-You're super!

80
00:07:17,013 --> 00:07:20,164
In the Silverdome,
now ablaze with flashbulbs...

81
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:22,933
...as Hurray for Everything leaves!

82
00:07:23,133 --> 00:07:28,127
A stadium's too big for flash pictures
to work, but nobody cares!

83
00:07:30,613 --> 00:07:33,571
That's no way to lay a fire!

84
00:07:33,773 --> 00:07:38,051
-This will roar any time now.
-A caveman could start it.

85
00:07:38,453 --> 00:07:42,571
-Dinner! Dinnertime, everybody!
-The hell with this.

86
00:07:44,293 --> 00:07:49,128
Okay, Lisa, we're ready
for your centerpiece.

87
00:07:49,373 --> 00:07:54,891
Lisa, my goodness.
That's very impressive.

88
00:07:55,093 --> 00:08:00,292
Holy moly! That's the biggest
one of those I ever saw!

89
00:08:00,493 --> 00:08:04,930
-I always said she was gifted.
-Definitely from our side. Right, Mom?

90
00:08:05,173 --> 00:08:07,971
-Leave me be.
-How long did that take you?

91
00:08:08,173 --> 00:08:11,483
I couldn't tell you.
It was a labor of love.

92
00:08:11,693 --> 00:08:13,729
It's my homage to some heroes...

93
00:08:13,973 --> 00:08:16,851
...who may not have fought any wars,
but who--

94
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:23,849
Speaking of heroes, here's mine:
Tom Turkey!

95
00:08:24,053 --> 00:08:27,125
-Yikes! What is that?
-It's the centerpiece.

96
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:29,893
-It's taking up real estate.
-Stop it!

97
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:31,685
-Move it, toots!
-Mom!

98
00:08:31,893 --> 00:08:33,884
I'm sure there's room for both.

99
00:08:34,093 --> 00:08:35,924
Let me....

100
00:08:36,813 --> 00:08:41,329
Bart, you're wrecking it!
Let go! I worked forever on this!

101
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:51,847
-Hey, that got her going!
-Bitchen!

102
00:08:53,493 --> 00:08:57,611
Bart! You don't even care!
You don't even care!

103
00:09:05,173 --> 00:09:07,767
All right, that's it!
Go to your room now!

104
00:09:07,973 --> 00:09:12,410
I'll take some white meat to go,
and send up the pie.

105
00:09:12,613 --> 00:09:14,922
-I said now!
-Mom, do I have to?

106
00:09:15,133 --> 00:09:18,330
Yes, you do!
I hope you're happy, Bart!

107
00:09:18,573 --> 00:09:21,929
You've ruined Thanksgiving!

108
00:09:25,453 --> 00:09:29,685
I didn't ruin Thanksgiving, she did.
I always get blamed.

109
00:09:29,893 --> 00:09:33,169
And Lord, we're thankful
for nuclear power...

110
00:09:33,413 --> 00:09:36,132
...the cleanest,
safest energy source...

111
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:39,564
...except for solar,
which is a pipe dream.

112
00:09:39,813 --> 00:09:44,523
Thank you for the occasional moments
of love our family's experienced.

113
00:09:44,773 --> 00:09:47,571
Not today. You saw what happened!

114
00:09:47,813 --> 00:09:52,523
Lord, be honest! Are we the most
pathetic family in the universe?

115
00:09:52,773 --> 00:09:57,130
-Amen.
-Worst prayer yet.

116
00:09:59,653 --> 00:10:02,247
Why don't I go talk to the children?

117
00:10:02,493 --> 00:10:06,168
Don't worry, Marge will
fix everything.

118
00:10:12,013 --> 00:10:15,722
Honey, your food is getting cold.

119
00:10:16,933 --> 00:10:20,448
-That's all right.
-I'm sorry about what happened.

120
00:10:20,693 --> 00:10:23,253
I poured my heart
into that centerpiece!

121
00:10:23,493 --> 00:10:27,247
-Things like that always happen!
-I've noticed that.

122
00:10:27,453 --> 00:10:31,128
When you feel like coming down,
we'll be there.

123
00:10:37,693 --> 00:10:41,971
You can come down to dinner
when you're ready to apologize.

124
00:10:42,213 --> 00:10:46,172
And it's going to be a real apology
in front of everybody.

125
00:10:46,413 --> 00:10:51,328
Apologize? For what? Clearing the
table? Having a sense of humor?

126
00:10:51,573 --> 00:10:55,327
They think they can starve
an apology out of me?

127
00:10:58,813 --> 00:11:01,168
Uh-oh. I mean, good!

128
00:11:03,293 --> 00:11:06,603
Hey, what are you doing?! No!
Drop that drumstick!

129
00:11:06,813 --> 00:11:08,724
Bad dog! Bad Santa's Helper.

130
00:11:08,933 --> 00:11:14,530
Come on, give me that. Give me that!
Don't! Okay, out you go!

131
00:11:15,213 --> 00:11:17,443
Boy, come here. You're a good dog.

132
00:11:18,173 --> 00:11:21,927
We don't need them
to get a Thanksgiving dinner.

133
00:11:29,533 --> 00:11:31,046
Wow! Swanky!

134
00:11:37,173 --> 00:11:41,564
Smithers, every year you
outstrip yourself in succulence.

135
00:11:41,813 --> 00:11:44,930
Thank you, sir.
Would you like some yams?

136
00:11:45,133 --> 00:11:48,762
No, I couldn't eat another bite.
Dispose of all this.

137
00:11:49,013 --> 00:11:52,369
I did save room
for your special pumpkin pie.

138
00:11:52,613 --> 00:11:55,047
It's cooling on the windowsill.

139
00:11:56,933 --> 00:11:59,128
Stay here, boy.

140
00:12:17,533 --> 00:12:19,251
Mr. Burns? Base command.

141
00:12:19,453 --> 00:12:22,126
The intruder is a young male,
age 9 to 11.

142
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:25,131
Release the hounds.

143
00:12:37,373 --> 00:12:42,049
I saw the best meals
Of my generation destroyed

144
00:12:42,293 --> 00:12:45,126
By the madness of my brother

145
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:51,329
My soul carved in slices
By spiky-haired demons

146
00:12:54,213 --> 00:12:58,923
Don't worry. We'll get some grub.
Even if we have to pay for it.

147
00:13:09,813 --> 00:13:13,931
Cool! The wrong side of the tracks.

148
00:13:20,093 --> 00:13:23,927
Twelve bucks! Hey, I can bleed.

149
00:13:26,813 --> 00:13:30,328
You've gotta be 18.
Let's see some I.D.

150
00:13:30,533 --> 00:13:34,162
-Here you go, doll face.
-Okay, Homer. Just relax.

151
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:38,241
At the risk of losing my voice...

152
00:13:38,493 --> 00:13:42,964
...let me just say one more thing:
I'm sorry I came.

153
00:13:43,173 --> 00:13:46,165
-When's he going to apologize?
-He's stubborn.

154
00:13:46,413 --> 00:13:51,168
Homer was never stubborn.
He always folded instantly.

155
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:53,847
As if he had no will of his own.

156
00:13:54,093 --> 00:13:56,687
-Isn't that true, Homer?
-Yes, Dad.

157
00:13:59,013 --> 00:14:02,926
Twelve bucks and a free cookie.
What a country.

158
00:14:14,093 --> 00:14:16,926
-Cute little guy.
-He's coming around.

159
00:14:17,133 --> 00:14:20,842
-You look a little pale, son.
-We better get you some food.

160
00:14:21,613 --> 00:14:23,922
Here we are.

161
00:14:30,213 --> 00:14:33,046
All right! Twelve big ones
and free grub!

162
00:14:33,293 --> 00:14:37,525
Viva skid row! Hey, it's that
anchor dude from Channel 6.

163
00:14:37,733 --> 00:14:41,248
He's doing one of those
be-thankful stories.

164
00:14:41,493 --> 00:14:44,053
We have lots of names
for these people:

165
00:14:44,293 --> 00:14:48,047
Bums, deadbeats, losers,
scums of the earth.

166
00:14:48,293 --> 00:14:53,447
We'd like to sweep them into the gutter
or to some other out-of-the-way place.

167
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:57,972
Oh, we have our reasons:
They're depressing.

168
00:14:58,213 --> 00:15:01,888
-They're crazy. They smell bad.
-Hey, listen, man.

169
00:15:02,093 --> 00:15:03,572
I'm going somewhere.

170
00:15:03,813 --> 00:15:07,249
So every year on one lone,
conscience-salving day...

171
00:15:07,493 --> 00:15:11,372
...we toss these people a bone.
A turkey bone.

172
00:15:11,613 --> 00:15:14,047
That's supposed to make
it all better.

173
00:15:14,293 --> 00:15:20,050
You won't find the freeloader or
Charlie Chaplin's little tramp here.

174
00:15:20,293 --> 00:15:22,966
Pompous, blow-dried, college boy!

175
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:26,569
-His girlfriend does the weather.
-You don't say.

176
00:15:26,813 --> 00:15:29,885
Lisa wants to read us a poem
she's written.

177
00:15:30,093 --> 00:15:32,527
Sounds interesting.

178
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:37,923
"Howl of the Unappreciated"
by Lisa Simpson.

179
00:15:38,133 --> 00:15:39,771
"I saw the best meals--"

180
00:15:40,013 --> 00:15:42,049
-It's Bart!
-What show is this?

181
00:15:42,253 --> 00:15:44,721
How long have you been
on the streets?

182
00:15:44,973 --> 00:15:47,726
-Five years.
-Your family may be watching.

183
00:15:47,973 --> 00:15:52,251
-Anything you'd like to say?
-Ha-ha! I didn't apologize!

184
00:15:52,453 --> 00:15:55,092
Oh, no! My sweet, little Bart.

185
00:15:57,733 --> 00:15:59,963
Give me the number for 911!

186
00:16:03,053 --> 00:16:07,569
Thanks for your help.
This reporter smells another Emmy.

187
00:16:07,813 --> 00:16:11,965
We're rooting for you.
Got someplace to sleep tonight, Bart?

188
00:16:12,173 --> 00:16:15,006
Yeah, there's this family
I hang out with.

189
00:16:15,213 --> 00:16:18,603
-Sounds pretty sweet.
-Yeah, I guess it is.

190
00:16:19,413 --> 00:16:21,643
See you at Christmas.

191
00:16:26,253 --> 00:16:30,451
Guys, unless you feel weird
about taking money...

192
00:16:30,693 --> 00:16:32,570
...from a kid, I thought....

193
00:16:32,813 --> 00:16:36,408
-I wouldn't feel weird.
-I'm comfortable with it.

194
00:16:39,493 --> 00:16:43,122
Forget the report?
He's down at the Rescue Mission!

195
00:16:43,373 --> 00:16:44,522
He's long gone.

196
00:16:44,773 --> 00:16:47,367
Can you think of a reason
why he ran away?

197
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:51,964
Well, we did kind of yell at him
and sent him to his room...

198
00:16:52,173 --> 00:16:55,324
...and forced him to apologize
to his sister.

199
00:16:57,173 --> 00:17:02,372
-I said he ruined Thanksgiving.
-Oh, I see.

200
00:17:04,973 --> 00:17:07,646
Best Thanksgiving ever, eh, boy?

201
00:17:07,853 --> 00:17:10,526
Goodbye. I'm sure Bart will be back.

202
00:17:10,733 --> 00:17:14,726
I'd say something comforting,
but you know, my voice.

203
00:17:14,973 --> 00:17:17,806
Let's go! If I'm not back
at the home by 9...

204
00:17:18,053 --> 00:17:21,045
...they declare me dead
and collect my insurance.

205
00:17:21,693 --> 00:17:24,366
This is a terrible thing
that's happened.

206
00:17:24,613 --> 00:17:27,366
-But we can't blame ourselves.
-We can!

207
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:31,367
Children need discipline.
Ask any advice columnist.

208
00:17:31,613 --> 00:17:35,003
Marge, are we ever gonna
see him again?

209
00:17:37,733 --> 00:17:40,372
Should I or shouldn't I?

210
00:17:41,253 --> 00:17:45,565
-Hey, everybody, I'm home.
-Bart? You're home!

211
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:49,652
Oh, my special little guy!
We were so worried!

212
00:17:49,893 --> 00:17:52,851
Boy, we were afraid we'd lost you!

213
00:17:53,093 --> 00:17:57,769
Welcome back, Bart. I'm sorry we had
such a terrible fight.

214
00:17:58,013 --> 00:18:01,528
Isn't there something
you'd like to say to her?

215
00:18:01,733 --> 00:18:06,045
-Okay, I'm sorry too.
-No, no, no! That won't do at all!

216
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:09,968
Get down on your knees
and beg for forgiveness.

217
00:18:10,213 --> 00:18:12,488
Yeah, beg me, Bart. Beg me!

218
00:18:12,693 --> 00:18:15,571
Lisa, I beg of you, please forgive me.

219
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:23,486
Now we can blame him for everything!

220
00:18:23,693 --> 00:18:25,729
-It's your fault I'm bald!
-Sorry.

221
00:18:25,973 --> 00:18:28,123
-It's your fault I'm old!
-Sorry.

222
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:31,126
-It's your fault I can't talk!
-Sorry.

223
00:18:31,373 --> 00:18:35,252
It's your fault America
has lost its way.

224
00:18:35,453 --> 00:18:40,766
-It's all your fault.
-I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

225
00:18:41,013 --> 00:18:44,722
I'm sorry all right.
Sorry I came back here!

226
00:18:55,373 --> 00:18:58,649
Whoa! My whiffle balls,
my water rockets!

227
00:18:58,853 --> 00:19:02,368
Jackpot! A sellout crowd
at the Super Bowl...

228
00:19:02,613 --> 00:19:05,525
...Simpson down by six
with two seconds left.

229
00:19:05,773 --> 00:19:08,128
He's got Simpson in the open.

230
00:19:09,173 --> 00:19:11,641
Touchdown, Simpson!

231
00:19:11,893 --> 00:19:16,125
The boy nobody wanted
just won the Super Bowl!

232
00:19:19,773 --> 00:19:23,561
Dear Log, my brother
is still missing...

233
00:19:23,813 --> 00:19:29,331
...and maybe it's my fault.
I failed to take his abuse with humor.

234
00:19:29,573 --> 00:19:34,044
I miss him so much already
that I don't know....

235
00:19:37,813 --> 00:19:41,806
Hey, Lisa! It's me, Bart!

236
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:45,803
-Bart? Where are you?
-I'm on the roof.

237
00:19:53,813 --> 00:19:56,327
What are you doing?
Everybody's worried.

238
00:19:56,573 --> 00:19:58,052
-Did they cry?
-Yes.

239
00:19:58,293 --> 00:19:59,328
Bull's-eye!

240
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:03,725
-Why did you burn my centerpiece?
-Come on.

241
00:20:03,973 --> 00:20:06,692
Because you hate me
or because you're bad?

242
00:20:06,893 --> 00:20:10,329
I don't know.
I don't know why I enjoyed it...

243
00:20:10,573 --> 00:20:12,370
...or why I'll do it again!

244
00:20:12,613 --> 00:20:14,604
-Just tell me you're sorry.
-Why?

245
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:18,328
The only reason to apologize
is if you look...

246
00:20:18,733 --> 00:20:23,363
...inside yourself and find a spot
you wish wasn't there...

247
00:20:23,573 --> 00:20:27,088
...because you feel bad you hurt
my feelings.

248
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:29,488
-Leave me alone.
-Just look!

249
00:20:29,693 --> 00:20:35,211
Okay, okay. Looking for the spot.

250
00:20:35,413 --> 00:20:39,167
Still checking. This is stupid.
I won't find anything.

251
00:20:39,413 --> 00:20:44,806
Just because I wrecked something
she worked hard at and made her--

252
00:20:47,573 --> 00:20:52,363
-I'm sorry, Lisa.
-Apology accepted.

253
00:20:55,413 --> 00:20:58,246
You know, Marge, we're great parents.

254
00:20:58,453 --> 00:21:00,523
O Lord, we thank thee...

255
00:21:00,773 --> 00:21:04,527
...for giving us one more crack
at togetherness.

256
00:21:04,773 --> 00:21:06,923
Amen.
