1
00:00:05,813 --> 00:00:07,371
One Fish, Two Fish
Blow Fish, Blue Fish

2
00:00:56,693 --> 00:01:00,129
-Is it done yet?
-It will be ready in 8 seconds.

3
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:04,565
Isn't there anything faster than
a microwave? Four. Three.

4
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:07,446
Two. One. Bing!

5
00:01:07,613 --> 00:01:08,841
We have meat loaf!

6
00:01:09,053 --> 00:01:11,123
Get it while it's hot, kids.

7
00:01:13,413 --> 00:01:16,962
I've got a dried-out end piece with
your name on it.

8
00:01:17,493 --> 00:01:22,408
Thursday. Meat loaf night. As it was,
is now, and ever shall be.

9
00:01:22,613 --> 00:01:26,208
-Get to the point.
-You want me to be open-minded...

10
00:01:26,413 --> 00:01:31,248
-...try new things, live life--
-Who said that? Nobody wants that.

11
00:01:31,453 --> 00:01:34,763
-Shut up!
-Tomorrow night it would be nice...

12
00:01:34,973 --> 00:01:38,852
-...to go out for dinner.
-Friday? Pork chop night?

13
00:01:39,053 --> 00:01:43,012
We haven't missed pork chop night
since the pig scare in '87!

14
00:01:43,213 --> 00:01:48,924
Pork chops. From cradle to grave,
etched in stone--

15
00:01:49,133 --> 00:01:52,682
-Where do you wanna go?
-Anywhere but hamburgers or pizza.

16
00:01:52,893 --> 00:01:54,451
Fine! We'll go to Mars!

17
00:01:54,653 --> 00:01:57,770
-There's a new sushi place on Elm St.
-Sushi?

18
00:01:57,973 --> 00:02:02,012
Maybe this is a playground thing,
but isn't that raw fish?

19
00:02:02,213 --> 00:02:06,206
The playground has the facts right
but missed the point.

20
00:02:06,413 --> 00:02:09,610
-Sushi is considered a delicacy.
-Can we try it?

21
00:02:09,813 --> 00:02:12,373
-No.
-This argument humiliates us both.

22
00:02:12,573 --> 00:02:16,452
If I said no the first time,
would I say yes the second time?

23
00:02:16,653 --> 00:02:19,372
-Maybe on the ninety-ninth time.
-Try me.

24
00:02:19,613 --> 00:02:21,251
-Please, Dad?
-No!

25
00:02:21,453 --> 00:02:23,842
-Please, Dad?
-No!

26
00:02:24,053 --> 00:02:25,611
-Please, Dad?
-Okay!

27
00:02:30,933 --> 00:02:36,053
Don't be alarmed.
They were saying hello.

28
00:02:36,213 --> 00:02:37,771
Okay. Hello!

29
00:02:38,413 --> 00:02:41,610
This is our karaoke bar.
Now it is empty...

30
00:02:41,813 --> 00:02:45,442
...but soon it will be full
of drunken Japanese businessmen.

31
00:02:45,653 --> 00:02:48,372
I am Akira. May I take your order?

32
00:02:48,573 --> 00:02:52,691
What do you suggest for a family
unsure about being here?

33
00:02:52,893 --> 00:02:56,806
Sushi Surprise, a bit of everything.
Very non-threatening.

34
00:02:57,013 --> 00:02:58,810
-I'll have one.
-Make it two.

35
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:03,012
Akira, I'd like two sharks,
an octopus and an eel.

36
00:03:03,213 --> 00:03:07,331
-Do you have killer giant squid?
-Not today. Sir?

37
00:03:07,533 --> 00:03:11,048
It's hard to choose. It all looks
so terrible.

38
00:03:11,253 --> 00:03:14,962
Bring me one of these,
one of these and one of those.

39
00:03:23,053 --> 00:03:24,930
-What do you think?
-No!

40
00:03:25,133 --> 00:03:28,967
The squid looks like it's been
hacked by a blind woodsman.

41
00:03:29,173 --> 00:03:32,609
Hang your head in shame.

42
00:03:37,653 --> 00:03:40,451
Good thing I'm open-minded.

43
00:03:41,773 --> 00:03:43,729
Not bad. Interesting!

44
00:03:43,933 --> 00:03:47,005
I'll try this little pink one here.

45
00:03:47,213 --> 00:03:48,931
Very good! And another one.

46
00:03:49,133 --> 00:03:51,966
Oh, boy! This fish is delish!

47
00:03:55,253 --> 00:03:58,290
Hi, my name is Richie Sakai.

48
00:03:58,573 --> 00:04:01,087
I am an anesthesiologist.

49
00:04:01,293 --> 00:04:05,684
I'd like to dedicate this song
to my wife, Patty.

50
00:04:17,693 --> 00:04:20,571
-And two of these things.
-Two uni.

51
00:04:20,773 --> 00:04:24,243
I don't believe I've tried
the flying fish roll.

52
00:04:24,453 --> 00:04:27,286
-I recommend the raw quail egg.
-You're the doctor!

53
00:04:46,493 --> 00:04:51,442
There's gotta be something
I haven't tried. What's this? Fugu!

54
00:04:51,653 --> 00:04:55,612
It's blowfish, sir.
But I should warn you that one--

55
00:04:55,813 --> 00:04:58,930
Come on, pal. Fugu me!

56
00:05:15,253 --> 00:05:18,768
-She's here! Cover for me.
-One fugu.

57
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:24,851
-Not fugu. If it's cut improperly--
-Yes, it's poisonous, maybe fatal.

58
00:05:25,053 --> 00:05:29,888
-But cut properly, it's quite tasty.
-I must get the master.

59
00:05:32,853 --> 00:05:36,243
Oh, Miss Krabappel,
your hair smells so...

60
00:05:37,093 --> 00:05:40,290
-...clean.
-You're needed in the kitchen.

61
00:05:40,493 --> 00:05:44,884
-I said cover for me, damn it!
-Master, we need your skilled hands.

62
00:05:45,093 --> 00:05:49,086
My skilled hands are busy! You do it!

63
00:05:53,173 --> 00:05:56,290
Poison. Poison. Tasty fish!

64
00:05:58,973 --> 00:06:03,967
-Concentrate. Concentrate.
-I want fugu!

65
00:06:06,613 --> 00:06:10,242
Fan-fugu-tastic!

66
00:06:21,453 --> 00:06:23,762
Beautiful language, isn't it?

67
00:06:24,213 --> 00:06:27,364
-Don't eat another bite.
-I couldn't possibly.

68
00:06:27,573 --> 00:06:32,806
I shall be blunt. We have reason
to believe you've eaten poison.

69
00:06:33,013 --> 00:06:36,289
Poison! What should I do?
Tell me quick!

70
00:06:36,493 --> 00:06:40,406
Don't panic. There's a map
to the hospital on the menu.

71
00:06:42,493 --> 00:06:45,849
"Try something new.
How can it hurt you, Homer?"

72
00:06:46,053 --> 00:06:48,089
Never heard of a poisoned
pork chop!

73
00:06:48,293 --> 00:06:50,761
Your wife agreed I should tell you.

74
00:06:50,973 --> 00:06:54,648
No need, doc.
I can read Marge like a book.

75
00:06:55,253 --> 00:06:58,882
-It's good news, isn't it?
-No, Mr. Simpson.

76
00:06:59,133 --> 00:07:04,207
If you have consumed blowfish venom,
and the chef said it's probable...

77
00:07:04,413 --> 00:07:08,611
-...you have 24 hours to live.
-24 hours?

78
00:07:08,813 --> 00:07:11,771
Well, 22. I'm sorry
I kept you waiting.

79
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:15,682
-I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die!
-I know.

80
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:20,603
One consolation is that you'll feel
no pain until tomorrow evening...

81
00:07:20,853 --> 00:07:22,969
...when your heart explodes.

82
00:07:23,173 --> 00:07:27,405
Death anxiety is normal.
Expect to go through five stages.

83
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:30,047
-First, denial.
-No way! I'm not dying!

84
00:07:30,253 --> 00:07:32,972
-The second is anger.
-Why, you little--!

85
00:07:33,173 --> 00:07:36,245
-After that comes fear.
-What's after fear?

86
00:07:36,453 --> 00:07:39,365
-Bargaining.
-You gotta get me out of this.

87
00:07:39,573 --> 00:07:43,043
-Finally, acceptance.
-We all gotta go sometime.

88
00:07:43,253 --> 00:07:46,643
Your progress astounds me.
I'll leave you two alone.

89
00:07:46,853 --> 00:07:49,686
Perhaps this pamphlet
will be helpful.

90
00:07:49,893 --> 00:07:52,885
"So You're Going to Die."

91
00:08:00,133 --> 00:08:04,809
Hello, Marge. Hello!
I'm the one dying, not you.

92
00:08:05,533 --> 00:08:07,364
I'm sorry, Homer.

93
00:08:08,253 --> 00:08:12,963
-Have you thought of what to tell them?
-Nothing, it'll just upset them.

94
00:08:13,173 --> 00:08:16,961
I want my last hours of family life
to be happy ones.

95
00:08:17,173 --> 00:08:20,563
-You know what you wanna do tomorrow?
-Almost.

96
00:08:23,373 --> 00:08:24,931
Oh, good!

97
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:27,528
I'm not done yet, Marge.

98
00:08:27,853 --> 00:08:32,563
What's that word you use
for when you and I...?

99
00:08:32,773 --> 00:08:34,286
When we're intimate?

100
00:08:34,493 --> 00:08:36,370
"Be intimate with Marge."

101
00:08:37,013 --> 00:08:39,049
Can I make one suggestion?

102
00:08:39,253 --> 00:08:42,563
Can we get up early and watch
the sunrise together?

103
00:08:42,773 --> 00:08:46,322
"Watch the sunrise."

104
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:51,887
Till 6 a.m., my dearest darling,
on my last day on Earth.

105
00:09:02,453 --> 00:09:05,251
11:30! That's just great!

106
00:09:05,453 --> 00:09:09,526
-Why did you let me sleep late?
-You looked so peaceful.

107
00:09:09,733 --> 00:09:14,409
There will be plenty of time for that!
I got tons of stuff to do!

108
00:09:14,773 --> 00:09:17,890
"Have man-to-man with Bart."

109
00:09:19,293 --> 00:09:21,887
-Come here, boy.
-Oh, man.

110
00:09:23,613 --> 00:09:27,288
I wanna have a heart-to-heart talk!

111
00:09:27,493 --> 00:09:30,326
After me, you're the man
around the house.

112
00:09:30,533 --> 00:09:32,171
So you have to help out--

113
00:09:32,413 --> 00:09:35,485
Lisa never lifts a finger.
Go yell at her!

114
00:09:35,693 --> 00:09:40,642
Shut up! This is good stuff.
I wanna share something with you.

115
00:09:40,853 --> 00:09:43,970
The three sentences to
get you through life.

116
00:09:44,173 --> 00:09:48,769
Number one: Cover for me.
Number two: Oh, good idea, boss!

117
00:09:48,973 --> 00:09:51,806
Three: It was like that
when I got here.

118
00:09:52,013 --> 00:09:55,005
-This is good stuff.
-Let's learn how to shave.

119
00:09:55,213 --> 00:09:59,889
Finally, the little spot
under your nose.

120
00:10:00,093 --> 00:10:03,085
Next, we take some toilet paper...

121
00:10:03,293 --> 00:10:07,252
...tear off some little squares
and stick one there...

122
00:10:07,453 --> 00:10:11,810
...and there, and any place
you're bleeding. There.

123
00:10:12,013 --> 00:10:14,527
The blood will hold it
on your face.

124
00:10:14,733 --> 00:10:17,167
And now, some aftershave.

125
00:10:21,453 --> 00:10:23,125
You son of a--!

126
00:10:23,813 --> 00:10:25,371
And that's how we shave.

127
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:30,282
-You little--
-It was like that when I got here!

128
00:10:30,493 --> 00:10:32,723
That's my boy!

129
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:36,608
"Listen to Lisa play her sax."

130
00:10:38,173 --> 00:10:40,812
Want me to cut out
this infernal racket?

131
00:10:41,053 --> 00:10:42,930
-Let me hear you play.
-Why?

132
00:10:43,133 --> 00:10:48,082
Does a father have to explain?
Let's just share your gift, okay?

133
00:10:59,773 --> 00:11:02,162
That's more like it!

134
00:11:05,013 --> 00:11:08,972
Oh, I want to be in that rumba

135
00:11:09,173 --> 00:11:13,291
When the saints go over there

136
00:11:13,653 --> 00:11:15,052
Oh, over there!

137
00:11:21,853 --> 00:11:24,765
"Make videotape for Maggie."

138
00:11:25,813 --> 00:11:28,805
What a surprise!
We were just pulling taffy.

139
00:11:29,013 --> 00:11:32,767
-The fun never stops here, does it?
-No, sirree bob!

140
00:11:32,973 --> 00:11:37,364
-Flanders, can I borrow the camcorder?
-Okey-dokel!

141
00:11:37,693 --> 00:11:41,686
Why don't you guys come over for
a barbecue tomorrow?

142
00:11:41,893 --> 00:11:44,407
-No, thanks.
-We have a propane beauty...

143
00:11:44,613 --> 00:11:46,285
-...in the backyard.
-No.

144
00:11:46,493 --> 00:11:50,532
-It's crying out to cook up good food!
-Flanders, I said--

145
00:11:50,733 --> 00:11:57,411
Tomorrow? Sure! What the hey?
I'd love to come to your barbecue.

146
00:11:57,653 --> 00:12:02,807
I'll even bring the thickest, juiciest
T-bones you've ever seen.

147
00:12:03,413 --> 00:12:04,607
Sounds terrif!

148
00:12:04,813 --> 00:12:07,930
The joke's on him!
I'll be dead by then.

149
00:12:08,173 --> 00:12:10,687
I am trying to....
Is that it?

150
00:12:12,053 --> 00:12:17,525
This is a videotape
for my daughter, Maggie. Hey, Maggie!

151
00:12:17,733 --> 00:12:22,329
I'm speaking to you
from beyond the grave.

152
00:12:23,053 --> 00:12:27,092
Hope that didn't scare you.
Maggie, you're grown-up now.

153
00:12:27,293 --> 00:12:31,491
Unless you taped over this,
you probably wonder about your dad.

154
00:12:31,693 --> 00:12:36,050
He was a simple, kind and gentle man
who loved his children and-- D'oh!

155
00:12:37,973 --> 00:12:41,443
Hello? Yeah, he's here.
Who is this? Milhouse?

156
00:12:41,653 --> 00:12:43,609
Bart! Get your butt down here!

157
00:12:49,613 --> 00:12:52,685
-Dad!
-It's you. What do you want?

158
00:12:52,893 --> 00:12:56,249
-We've never been close, have we?
-Not to my knowledge.

159
00:12:56,453 --> 00:12:59,570
Never went fishing,
played catch or hugged.

160
00:12:59,773 --> 00:13:02,333
We never danced
the hootchy-koo either.

161
00:13:02,533 --> 00:13:06,367
I just want you to know
that I love you, Dad!

162
00:13:06,573 --> 00:13:08,404
-You do?
-Uh-huh.

163
00:13:08,613 --> 00:13:11,446
Oh, son, I love you too!

164
00:13:11,653 --> 00:13:13,086
How about a hug?

165
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,521
-Dad!
-Sonny boy!

166
00:13:14,733 --> 00:13:15,961
-Papa!
-Junior!

167
00:13:16,173 --> 00:13:17,447
My old man.

168
00:13:17,733 --> 00:13:19,451
I gotta go.

169
00:13:19,653 --> 00:13:22,804
No! We've got a lot
of catching up to do.

170
00:13:23,013 --> 00:13:24,844
How about we go fishing?

171
00:13:25,053 --> 00:13:28,284
Gee. If I wasn't
on such a tight schedule....

172
00:13:30,413 --> 00:13:32,563
Let's get some worms.

173
00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:39,806
Well, no time for that.

174
00:13:42,813 --> 00:13:45,486
I really wanted to do that one.

175
00:13:48,773 --> 00:13:50,843
Gee, Dad, hog my last moments.

176
00:13:51,053 --> 00:13:53,886
Just a quick game of hacky sack.

177
00:13:55,853 --> 00:14:01,405
-I love you, son!
-The old guy's a little love-starved.

178
00:14:01,693 --> 00:14:05,083
Move, you hunk of junk!
Gotta make up for lost time!

179
00:14:05,373 --> 00:14:06,567
D'oh!

180
00:14:09,733 --> 00:14:13,931
I'm sorry. I know I was going
too fast. Just give me a ticket.

181
00:14:14,133 --> 00:14:16,283
-Beg your pardon?
-The ticket!

182
00:14:16,493 --> 00:14:21,328
-That sounded like an order.
-I pay my taxes. They pay your salary.

183
00:14:21,533 --> 00:14:26,129
When I say give me a ticket,
just give me a ticket!

184
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:31,361
-Maybe we don't wanna give it to you.
-Maybe we wanna haul your butt in.

185
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:35,769
Look what else
your tax dollars pay for.

186
00:14:44,893 --> 00:14:47,361
That's sort of nice.
What are you in for?

187
00:14:47,573 --> 00:14:48,892
Atmosphere.

188
00:14:49,453 --> 00:14:52,047
Okay, Flash. You get one phone call.

189
00:14:53,373 --> 00:14:57,048
I can't call Marge.
It's our last day together.

190
00:14:57,253 --> 00:15:01,166
I can't drag her into this mess.
I'll call Barney.

191
00:15:03,173 --> 00:15:06,324
Nobody's here! Nobody's here!

192
00:15:06,533 --> 00:15:09,525
Damn those answering machine tapes!

193
00:15:10,413 --> 00:15:13,928
Thanks! I just wasted my only
call on your stupid--

194
00:15:14,133 --> 00:15:16,442
I'm home! I'm home!

195
00:15:16,653 --> 00:15:18,644
-Hi!
-Help me. I'm in jail.

196
00:15:18,853 --> 00:15:24,769
You are? Hey, Homer, go to the window.
Hey, neighbor! I can see you!

197
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:29,126
-Get over here. Bring 50 bucks for bail!
-50 bucks?

198
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,722
What did you do? Kill a judge?

199
00:15:31,933 --> 00:15:34,686
Where am I gonna get 50 bucks?

200
00:15:36,773 --> 00:15:39,162
Pizza!

201
00:15:42,573 --> 00:15:46,486
-Why are we all dressed up?
-Sometimes it's fun to dress up.

202
00:15:46,693 --> 00:15:50,891
-Why are we using the good china?
-Sometimes it's fun to use it.

203
00:15:51,093 --> 00:15:53,926
-Why candles?
-Sometimes candles are fun.

204
00:15:54,133 --> 00:15:57,330
-Why wait for Dad?
-Because we love him...

205
00:15:57,533 --> 00:16:02,402
-...and we enjoy his company.
-Why are we really waiting for Dad?

206
00:16:03,653 --> 00:16:06,611
Forty-eight dollars
and 70 cents.

207
00:16:06,853 --> 00:16:09,128
We don't usually take rusty money.

208
00:16:10,133 --> 00:16:16,481
You're dying and you wouldn't even
stop to have a beer with your buddies?

209
00:16:17,133 --> 00:16:22,890
It was on my list with a lot of other
things I didn't get to do today.

210
00:16:23,093 --> 00:16:24,492
Hey, my boss!

211
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:28,242
Check out the luscious pair
on that redhead.

212
00:16:28,453 --> 00:16:32,207
-That's it, baby. Work those ankles!
-Ring-a-ding-ding, sir.

213
00:16:32,453 --> 00:16:36,412
-Burns! Eat my shorts!
-Who the sam hill was that?

214
00:16:36,613 --> 00:16:40,447
It's Homer Simpson. One of the schmoes
from sector 7-G.

215
00:16:40,653 --> 00:16:44,692
I want him in my office at 9:00,
Monday morning.

216
00:16:44,893 --> 00:16:47,361
We'll see who eats whose shorts.

217
00:16:48,213 --> 00:16:53,048
Of all the luck. I almost died without
telling the boss to eat my shorts.

218
00:16:53,253 --> 00:16:58,930
Oh, Homer. Come on! You've got
time for one last beer. Please!

219
00:17:00,733 --> 00:17:03,372
I gotta call Marge.

220
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:07,327
Moe's Tavern.
Birthplace of the Rob Roy.

221
00:17:07,533 --> 00:17:11,572
-Is Seymour there? Last name Butts.
-Just a sec.

222
00:17:11,773 --> 00:17:15,607
Hey, is there a Butts here?
A Seymour Butts?

223
00:17:15,813 --> 00:17:20,489
Hey, everybody. I wanna Seymour Butts!

224
00:17:20,693 --> 00:17:22,172
Wait a minute.

225
00:17:22,373 --> 00:17:24,682
You scum-sucking pus bucket!

226
00:17:24,893 --> 00:17:30,251
When I get you, I'm gonna pull out
your eyeballs with a corkscrew!

227
00:17:31,293 --> 00:17:35,730
It was busy.
Moe, another last beer, please.

228
00:17:37,613 --> 00:17:40,923
Guys, keep it down.
I've got some last words.

229
00:17:41,133 --> 00:17:46,571
I never told you, but sometimes when
I'm at work, I think of you and smile.

230
00:17:46,773 --> 00:17:51,324
So often I think that-- Oh, words
won't do it. I love you, Moe!

231
00:17:51,533 --> 00:17:52,807
Not in public!

232
00:17:53,133 --> 00:17:55,772
-You'd better be dying!
-I love you!

233
00:17:55,973 --> 00:18:00,603
-How European!
-Come on! I gotta get home!

234
00:18:02,413 --> 00:18:06,531
-Faster! Faster!
-I'm twirling as fast as I can!

235
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:12,884
I can't wait any longer.
Hold on, Marge. I'm coming home!

236
00:18:18,493 --> 00:18:20,484
Where can he be?

237
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:24,043
Marge! Marge!

238
00:18:26,053 --> 00:18:29,443
I don't have an explan--
Love you, love you, love you!

239
00:18:29,853 --> 00:18:32,731
I wrote a poem for you
this afternoon.

240
00:18:32,933 --> 00:18:35,686
-It's called, "To a Husband."
-Okay.

241
00:18:37,013 --> 00:18:38,605
The clouds are forming

242
00:18:38,773 --> 00:18:40,126
Give me a break.

243
00:18:40,293 --> 00:18:43,603
Soon the rain will fall
My dear one is departing

244
00:18:43,813 --> 00:18:49,649
But first, please heed this call
That always will I love you

245
00:18:49,853 --> 00:18:52,970
My one, my love, my all

246
00:18:53,213 --> 00:18:54,931
That was beautiful!

247
00:19:09,373 --> 00:19:13,332
Goodbye, Maggie.
Stay as sweet as you are.

248
00:19:15,413 --> 00:19:19,725
Goodbye, Lisa.
I know you'll make me proud.

249
00:19:22,133 --> 00:19:26,649
Goodbye, Bart.
I like your sheets.

250
00:19:30,573 --> 00:19:32,609
The Good Book.

251
00:19:32,933 --> 00:19:34,286
On tape?

252
00:19:34,493 --> 00:19:37,212
Oh, it's read by Larry King.

253
00:19:40,573 --> 00:19:45,442
I'm Larry King. In the beginning,
God created the heaven and the earth.

254
00:19:45,653 --> 00:19:47,689
The earth was without....

255
00:19:47,893 --> 00:19:51,363
--begat Phinehas.
Phinehas begat Abishua.

256
00:19:51,853 --> 00:19:54,162
--begat Ahimaaz. Ahimaaz begat--

257
00:19:54,533 --> 00:19:58,208
Amariah begets Ahitub.
Ahitub begets--

258
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:05,412
And he shall turn the heart
of the fathers to the children.

259
00:20:05,613 --> 00:20:08,730
Lest I come and smite the earth
with a curse.

260
00:20:08,933 --> 00:20:13,484
That's it. Duke Zeibert's standing by.
We'll get some matzo ball soup.

261
00:20:13,693 --> 00:20:17,845
I love the Spurs. If you're betting,
they're gonna win it all.

262
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:20,971
I guess there's nothing more
to say but--

263
00:20:29,973 --> 00:20:33,283
Homer? Homer?

264
00:20:38,173 --> 00:20:40,971
Oh, Homer.

265
00:20:41,133 --> 00:20:43,283
Homer.

266
00:20:44,853 --> 00:20:48,368
His drool, it's warm!

267
00:20:49,893 --> 00:20:53,044
He's alive! Homer! Homer, wake up!

268
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:55,244
-You're alive!
-Stop it!

269
00:20:55,453 --> 00:20:58,650
-Wake up! You're alive!
-What are you talking about?

270
00:20:58,853 --> 00:21:00,923
-You're alive!
-I'm alive!

271
00:21:01,133 --> 00:21:03,966
I'm alive!
And I couldn't be happier!

272
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:08,608
From now on, I vow
to live life to its fullest!

273
00:21:11,773 --> 00:21:15,049
-Three in a row!
-Let's see that again.

274
00:21:15,293 --> 00:21:18,968
-Here we go.
-Excellent wrist action.

275
00:21:19,173 --> 00:21:24,201
It was just about to go into
the gutter and made a nice spin.

276
00:21:32,733 --> 00:21:36,567
Well, if he makes this,
he'll be down by 40 pins.

277
00:21:36,773 --> 00:21:38,604
The match is far from over.

278
00:21:38,853 --> 00:21:43,165
Yes, it is, but his approach
has been wrong from the beginning.

279
00:21:43,413 --> 00:21:47,770
He's erratic. He tends to explode.

280
00:21:53,973 --> 00:21:58,410
-In Illinois.
-Actually, that was Michigan.

281
00:21:58,653 --> 00:22:04,410
Well, he's stepping up now.
He needs to get at least a spare.
