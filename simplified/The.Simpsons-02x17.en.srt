1
00:00:07,773 --> 00:00:09,923
Old Money

2
00:01:22,413 --> 00:01:25,086
Next time we'll do
something more fun.

3
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:30,612
Oh, what could be more fun than
today's trip to the liquor store?

4
00:01:30,853 --> 00:01:32,445
Thanks for the jerky!

5
00:01:32,653 --> 00:01:34,291
-Say goodbye.
-Bye.

6
00:01:34,493 --> 00:01:35,687
Good--

7
00:01:37,253 --> 00:01:40,723
Grampa smells like that
trunk with the wet bottom.

8
00:01:40,933 --> 00:01:43,686
-He smells like a photo lab.
-Stop it!

9
00:01:43,893 --> 00:01:48,523
Grampa smells like an old man,
which is like a hospital hallway.

10
00:01:48,773 --> 00:01:52,812
That's terrible. We should
teach them to value the elderly.

11
00:01:53,053 --> 00:01:56,489
-We'll be old someday.
-My God, you're right!

12
00:01:56,733 --> 00:01:59,088
You kids won't put me in a home?

13
00:01:59,293 --> 00:02:00,328
Well....

14
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:02,686
What'll we do?

15
00:02:02,933 --> 00:02:06,528
-I think we better set an example.
-Absolutely!

16
00:02:06,773 --> 00:02:09,924
Our Sundays should be a pleasure.

17
00:02:10,173 --> 00:02:12,892
Where's a fun place we can
take Grampa?

18
00:02:13,093 --> 00:02:14,492
-To the pony ride!
-No.

19
00:02:14,693 --> 00:02:16,365
-Boring.
-He can't sit.

20
00:02:16,573 --> 00:02:19,610
I enjoy the glass blower
at Old Springfield.

21
00:02:19,853 --> 00:02:20,842
He saw that.

22
00:02:21,053 --> 00:02:24,250
Big yawner.
The Museum of Barnyard Oddities!

23
00:02:24,453 --> 00:02:26,409
-No, Bart! No!
-That's gross.

24
00:02:26,653 --> 00:02:28,723
I got it! The Mystery Spot!

25
00:02:28,973 --> 00:02:31,248
It's just a dumb mud puddle.

26
00:02:33,493 --> 00:02:36,166
Discount Lion Safari!

27
00:02:37,573 --> 00:02:40,133
Like I'm gonna ruin $600 teeth...

28
00:02:40,373 --> 00:02:43,046
...on 40 cents' worth of beef.

29
00:02:47,213 --> 00:02:48,692
These aren't my pills!

30
00:02:48,893 --> 00:02:52,932
Now, Mr. Simmons. Don't make me
call Nurse Bronski.

31
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:56,085
It's Simpson, and these aren't
my pills.

32
00:02:56,293 --> 00:03:00,081
Excuse me. My name is Simmons.
I have the wrong pills.

33
00:03:00,373 --> 00:03:04,844
I get two red for my back,
a yellow one for my arrhythmia...

34
00:03:05,053 --> 00:03:09,649
...and two of the bluest eyes
I've ever seen in my life.

35
00:03:10,133 --> 00:03:12,693
-These must be....
-I have your....

36
00:03:12,973 --> 00:03:15,282
They must have....

37
00:03:26,053 --> 00:03:31,002
Look at us. We're staring like a
couple of stupid punk teenagers.

38
00:03:31,213 --> 00:03:34,683
Oh, I wasn't staring, it's,
uh, my lazy eye.

39
00:03:34,893 --> 00:03:37,851
I'm Beatrice Simmons.
My friends call me Bea.

40
00:03:38,053 --> 00:03:40,521
Well, I'm Abraham J. Simpson.

41
00:03:40,773 --> 00:03:43,492
Care to tip the wrist with me?

42
00:03:43,733 --> 00:03:45,246
I would be delighted.

43
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:50,281
So, tell me about yourself.

44
00:03:50,573 --> 00:03:53,849
Widower, one son, one working kidney.
And you?

45
00:03:54,053 --> 00:03:56,328
Widowed, bad hip, liver disorder.

46
00:03:56,533 --> 00:04:00,082
You left something out: Ravishing!

47
00:04:20,373 --> 00:04:24,002
-What are you doing tonight?
-Sitting alone in my room.

48
00:04:24,253 --> 00:04:26,244
If you've got plans already--

49
00:04:26,453 --> 00:04:28,683
-No! What were you saying?
-Nothing.

50
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:31,612
Abe. You were going to say something.

51
00:04:31,973 --> 00:04:34,931
I was wondering
if you and l, you know...

52
00:04:35,173 --> 00:04:37,926
...might go to the same place.

53
00:04:38,173 --> 00:04:42,007
-You'd think this would get easier!
-I'd love to.

54
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,289
Okay, now where's that pomade?

55
00:04:51,933 --> 00:04:54,367
Ah! "Never fly solo again."

56
00:04:56,173 --> 00:05:00,291
Aw, damn! Out of pomade.
Oh, well.

57
00:05:05,133 --> 00:05:09,490
Oh, hello, young lady.
Is your grandmother home?

58
00:05:09,693 --> 00:05:10,887
Oh, Abe.

59
00:05:11,093 --> 00:05:13,891
I'd better keep my good eye on you.

60
00:05:14,093 --> 00:05:15,492
Damn straight.

61
00:05:52,093 --> 00:05:55,847
Herman, a special lady is having
her birthday tomorrow.

62
00:05:56,053 --> 00:05:57,850
The battleship New Jersey.

63
00:05:58,053 --> 00:06:02,683
You idiot! My girlfriend, Bea.
Since this is the only store I know--

64
00:06:02,933 --> 00:06:07,051
Nothing says "I love you"
better than a military antique.

65
00:06:07,253 --> 00:06:09,448
Take a look at the bayonet case.

66
00:06:09,653 --> 00:06:13,487
-Hey, what's that?
-That was Napoleon's hat.

67
00:06:13,733 --> 00:06:16,486
-It doesn't look it.
-Not the famous one.

68
00:06:16,693 --> 00:06:21,323
He wore it for a week in 1796.
Before he beat the Sardinians.

69
00:06:21,533 --> 00:06:22,682
How much?

70
00:06:22,933 --> 00:06:24,685
-$400.
-I'll give you $5.

71
00:06:24,893 --> 00:06:28,886
Not an offer you should
make to a man with a gun.

72
00:06:29,133 --> 00:06:30,851
Try Grandma's World.

73
00:06:31,173 --> 00:06:34,529
Activewear, I need a price
check on a wool shawl.

74
00:06:37,173 --> 00:06:40,245
Dad! It's Sunday.
You know what that means.

75
00:06:40,453 --> 00:06:42,330
-Go away!
-Oh, come on, Dad.

76
00:06:42,573 --> 00:06:45,849
I promise we'll have fun.
We're gonna see lions.

77
00:06:46,053 --> 00:06:48,931
I can't. It's my girlfriend
Bea's birthday.

78
00:06:49,173 --> 00:06:53,086
Oh, you have a girlfriend.

79
00:06:53,293 --> 00:06:57,047
Well, happy birthday, Bea.

80
00:06:57,773 --> 00:07:01,891
She can come with us.
There's room for all your friends.

81
00:07:02,093 --> 00:07:04,129
She's not invisible, you idiot!

82
00:07:04,373 --> 00:07:06,603
-It's her birthday tonight.
-Right.

83
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,732
-Stop kicking the seat!
-I'm kicking it!

84
00:07:09,973 --> 00:07:12,646
-You want to know where we're going?
-No.

85
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:15,401
Discount Lion Safari!

86
00:07:15,613 --> 00:07:17,649
Damn these childproof doors!

87
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:24,531
-Hello.
-That'll be 18.50, Bwana.

88
00:07:24,733 --> 00:07:27,645
"Do not feed or
allow animals in car.

89
00:07:27,853 --> 00:07:30,083
Do not make eye contact."

90
00:07:30,293 --> 00:07:32,249
Are we in Africa yet?

91
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:37,202
-This place sucks.
-The animals are sleeping.

92
00:07:37,453 --> 00:07:40,365
Let 'em sleep on their own time!

93
00:07:45,213 --> 00:07:47,329
Are you sure this is the way?

94
00:07:47,573 --> 00:07:50,485
The road seems to have gotten
awfully bumpy.

95
00:07:53,853 --> 00:07:58,563
What a wingding. This is much better
than my girlfriend's party.

96
00:07:58,773 --> 00:08:00,331
Bart, get out and push.

97
00:08:00,533 --> 00:08:03,093
-Yeah, Bart, get out and push.
-No way!

98
00:08:03,293 --> 00:08:04,931
Okay, we've seen a lion.

99
00:08:05,173 --> 00:08:06,288
Can we go now?

100
00:08:20,653 --> 00:08:23,213
Oh, Bea!

101
00:08:31,173 --> 00:08:32,925
Mr. Simpson, I presume.

102
00:08:36,853 --> 00:08:41,290
-I got a date with an angel.
-You don't know how right you are.

103
00:08:41,493 --> 00:08:45,771
-What?
-I'm sorry to tell you this, but...

104
00:08:45,973 --> 00:08:49,283
-...Bea passed away last night.
-Oh, no.

105
00:08:49,493 --> 00:08:53,168
The doc said her left ventricle burst.

106
00:08:53,373 --> 00:08:58,003
No, Jasper. They may say
she died of a burst ventricle...

107
00:08:58,253 --> 00:09:02,690
...but I know she died
of a broken heart.

108
00:09:09,053 --> 00:09:11,283
I can tell she really cared.

109
00:09:11,493 --> 00:09:14,291
She didn't make me a pallbearer.

110
00:09:16,613 --> 00:09:18,968
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

111
00:09:19,173 --> 00:09:21,926
Is someone talking?
I didn't hear anything.

112
00:09:22,133 --> 00:09:24,886
Oh, no! Dad's lost his hearing!

113
00:09:25,093 --> 00:09:27,766
No, you idiot! I'm ignoring you!

114
00:09:27,973 --> 00:09:31,283
You made me miss the last
moments of Bea's life.

115
00:09:31,493 --> 00:09:37,329
I'll never speak to you again!
I have no son!

116
00:09:42,933 --> 00:09:44,889
Oh, Bea.

117
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:53,688
It was a beautiful service.

118
00:09:54,533 --> 00:09:57,172
-Who are you?
-Lionel Hutz, attorney.

119
00:09:57,413 --> 00:09:59,529
I'm the executor of the estate.

120
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:02,691
Bea was wealthy and--
Surprise, surprise!

121
00:10:02,933 --> 00:10:04,764
She left it all to you.

122
00:10:05,013 --> 00:10:07,322
-Really?
-There is one catch.

123
00:10:07,533 --> 00:10:11,412
You must spend one night
in a haunted house.

124
00:10:11,613 --> 00:10:13,365
Just kidding.

125
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,889
Here's a check for $106,000...

126
00:10:17,133 --> 00:10:20,125
..."To enjoy as you see fit."
Oh, I'm touched.

127
00:10:20,373 --> 00:10:24,412
-$106,000!
-Ta-ta, Mr. Simpson.

128
00:10:24,653 --> 00:10:26,325
By the way, I do wills.

129
00:10:26,573 --> 00:10:29,371
Here's a pen with my
phone number on it.

130
00:10:29,573 --> 00:10:32,212
It looks like a cigar.
Isn't that neat?

131
00:10:33,653 --> 00:10:35,052
Hello, Homer?

132
00:10:35,253 --> 00:10:37,369
Dad's on the phone!

133
00:10:37,973 --> 00:10:42,285
-Oh, Dad, I knew you'd forgive me.
-I haven't forgiven you!

134
00:10:42,493 --> 00:10:46,327
I just inherited $106,000...

135
00:10:46,573 --> 00:10:52,284
...and I just had to tell you that
you're not getting one thin dime!

136
00:10:53,173 --> 00:10:54,811
-Mr. Simpson?
-What is it?

137
00:10:55,373 --> 00:10:58,092
I couldn't help hearing
about your money.

138
00:10:58,293 --> 00:11:03,731
Let me assure you that here,
money does make a difference.

139
00:11:03,933 --> 00:11:07,243
There are rubdowns,
and then there are rubdowns.

140
00:11:07,453 --> 00:11:10,047
Listen, you bloodsucker!

141
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:14,644
Does it ever occur to you that old
folks should be treated like humans...

142
00:11:14,853 --> 00:11:18,846
-...whether they have money or not?
-Yes, but it passes.

143
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,009
Oh, you lousy son of a....

144
00:11:21,773 --> 00:11:23,126
I'll take it!

145
00:11:23,453 --> 00:11:25,364
Big spender, why the change?

146
00:11:25,613 --> 00:11:30,209
Bea told me to enjoy my moola
and I'm going to, dagnab it!

147
00:11:37,053 --> 00:11:39,521
-Where to?
-Take me someplace fun!

148
00:11:39,773 --> 00:11:42,890
You're the boss.
Next stop, Funsville.

149
00:11:58,573 --> 00:12:01,246
-I miss Bea.
-I miss you too.

150
00:12:04,133 --> 00:12:06,852
Oh, calm down.
I'm not here to scare you.

151
00:12:07,053 --> 00:12:09,123
I'm haunting a family in Texas.

152
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:12,211
Oh, well, I'm glad
you're keeping busy.

153
00:12:12,413 --> 00:12:16,645
I want to know why my money
isn't bringing you happiness.

154
00:12:16,853 --> 00:12:19,970
Oh, Bea, I'm not cut out
for the highlife.

155
00:12:20,293 --> 00:12:24,286
If you're not happy,
why don't you spread it around?

156
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:27,212
Make other people as
happy as you made me.

157
00:12:27,453 --> 00:12:29,967
Oh, thanks, Bea. I will!

158
00:12:30,173 --> 00:12:32,050
And your son misses you.

159
00:12:32,253 --> 00:12:36,087
Oh, I miss him too,
the big fat dickens.

160
00:12:36,293 --> 00:12:41,242
Hey, Bea, I've got to ask you,
what was death like?

161
00:12:41,493 --> 00:12:43,529
Not as scary as this!

162
00:12:47,173 --> 00:12:49,289
I miss my daddy.

163
00:12:49,573 --> 00:12:53,361
This thing has had you
moping around for days.

164
00:12:53,573 --> 00:12:57,168
I think it's time for you
to talk to someone.

165
00:12:57,373 --> 00:13:00,729
You've reached Dr. Monroe's
Anxiety Line.

166
00:13:00,933 --> 00:13:03,572
If you have a sullen teenager,
press 1.

167
00:13:03,813 --> 00:13:08,329
For spousal problems, press 2 now.
If you have trouble--

168
00:13:08,533 --> 00:13:09,761
Grampa!

169
00:13:10,253 --> 00:13:12,130
-Dad!
-Sonny-boy!

170
00:13:14,253 --> 00:13:17,086
Is there room at your table
for an old man?

171
00:13:17,373 --> 00:13:20,012
Well, sure!

172
00:13:20,253 --> 00:13:23,404
We'll have to move a chair in,
but it's no problem. Bart!

173
00:13:23,693 --> 00:13:27,242
-Choose your corncob. En garde!
-Challenge accepted!

174
00:13:27,853 --> 00:13:30,811
All my precious sacks of gold...

175
00:13:31,013 --> 00:13:34,085
...couldn't buy me the joys
of a family meal.

176
00:13:34,373 --> 00:13:36,887
-Pass the bug juice.
-Wait your turn!

177
00:13:37,373 --> 00:13:42,242
I have an announcement. I've
decided to give Bea's money away...

178
00:13:42,453 --> 00:13:44,091
...to people who need it.

179
00:13:44,293 --> 00:13:49,492
I'm gonna let them come to me and
plead their case and then I'll decide.

180
00:13:49,693 --> 00:13:53,049
That's the noblest thought
ever expressed at this table.

181
00:13:53,253 --> 00:13:54,572
-Give it to us.
-Bart!

182
00:13:54,773 --> 00:13:57,890
Forgive him. He's just a
stupid little kid...

183
00:13:58,093 --> 00:14:00,561
...who says the first thing
in his head.

184
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:03,810
-You know, he is wise.
-You don't want it.

185
00:14:04,053 --> 00:14:06,044
-I do.
-You ain't getting it!

186
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:10,530
Not since my marriage to
the weather lady...

187
00:14:10,773 --> 00:14:16,086
...has this town been so consumed
with rumor and innuendo. Here's why:

188
00:14:16,293 --> 00:14:19,524
Today, one Abraham "Grampa"
Simpson announced...

189
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:24,887
...that he'll give away over $100,000
to the person he finds most deserving.

190
00:14:25,133 --> 00:14:28,967
Is Grampa Simpson a saint,
a rich nut, or both?

191
00:14:29,173 --> 00:14:34,691
Time will tell. Kent Brockman,
on line for an old man's money.

192
00:14:35,173 --> 00:14:38,131
You see, Gramps, I wanna
customize the bus.

193
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:40,927
Chop the top, jack it up,
put on wheels...

194
00:14:41,133 --> 00:14:47,083
...psychedelic paint job from hell.
Jam the kids to school!

195
00:14:47,413 --> 00:14:51,884
Here's a rendering. Note the cobra
wrapped around the naked chick.

196
00:14:52,093 --> 00:14:53,287
Next!

197
00:14:53,933 --> 00:14:54,922
Grampa?

198
00:14:55,253 --> 00:14:58,290
-I can call you Grampa, can't I?
-Go ahead.

199
00:14:58,493 --> 00:15:00,609
I need that money. Please--!

200
00:15:00,813 --> 00:15:05,011
Wait! You're the guy who owns
the nuclear power plant.

201
00:15:05,213 --> 00:15:07,966
-Ownership is divided--
-What are you doing?

202
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:12,371
I dread the day when $100,000
isn't worth groveling for.

203
00:15:12,573 --> 00:15:13,892
Get out of here!

204
00:15:14,133 --> 00:15:18,251
You just made yourself a very
powerful enemy, old man.

205
00:15:18,573 --> 00:15:20,211
Here's the deal, Grampa.

206
00:15:20,413 --> 00:15:23,928
A guy I think was an explorer
left this in the bar.

207
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:28,325
It may be a map to ancient treasure,
or directions to a house.

208
00:15:28,533 --> 00:15:33,004
To find out, we'll need money,
provisions and a diving bell.

209
00:15:33,213 --> 00:15:37,331
It's pretty stupid, but so far
you're the front-runner.

210
00:15:37,773 --> 00:15:39,729
It's an isolation chamber.

211
00:15:39,933 --> 00:15:42,811
A subject pulls levers to get
heat and food.

212
00:15:43,013 --> 00:15:47,689
The floor can become electrified
and water falls on the subject.

213
00:15:47,933 --> 00:15:49,810
I call it the Monroe box.

214
00:15:50,053 --> 00:15:52,726
Well, it sounds interesting.

215
00:15:52,973 --> 00:15:54,611
How much will it cost?

216
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:56,889
It's already built!

217
00:15:57,133 --> 00:16:00,523
I need the money to buy a baby
to raise in the box.

218
00:16:00,733 --> 00:16:01,768
To prove what?

219
00:16:01,973 --> 00:16:07,491
The subject should be maladjusted
and harbor resentment towards me.

220
00:16:07,773 --> 00:16:09,286
Interesting....

221
00:16:09,493 --> 00:16:13,281
I want a tear gas pen,
a blowgun with paralyzer darts--

222
00:16:13,493 --> 00:16:14,812
-Oh, no!
-Nunchucks.

223
00:16:15,053 --> 00:16:16,850
Nunchucks? What are those?

224
00:16:17,053 --> 00:16:18,771
Radioactive Man number 27.

225
00:16:18,973 --> 00:16:24,127
And I want that baseball card
where the guy's flipping the bird.

226
00:16:24,373 --> 00:16:26,648
-I've seen that one.
-And a monkey.

227
00:16:27,573 --> 00:16:29,165
What the hell is that?

228
00:16:29,373 --> 00:16:32,285
Why, it's a death ray, my good man.
Behold.

229
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:37,687
-Hey, feels warm. Kind of nice.
-Well, it's just the prototype.

230
00:16:37,893 --> 00:16:42,250
With funding, this baby could destroy
an area the size of New York.

231
00:16:42,453 --> 00:16:45,684
-I wanna help people, not kill them!
-Oh.

232
00:16:45,933 --> 00:16:49,130
The ray only has evil applications.

233
00:16:49,373 --> 00:16:53,730
My wife'll be happy. She's hated
this death ray from day one.

234
00:16:54,293 --> 00:16:58,889
Oh, Lisa, what makes you think you
deserve all that money?

235
00:16:59,093 --> 00:17:02,085
I don't deserve it, Grampa.
No one here does.

236
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:05,882
The people who deserve
it are in the slums.

237
00:17:06,133 --> 00:17:11,730
They're children who need books and
families who can't make ends meet.

238
00:17:11,973 --> 00:17:15,090
-But you can buy me a pony.
-You're right!

239
00:17:15,293 --> 00:17:16,851
I'll name her Princess.

240
00:17:17,053 --> 00:17:21,410
No, you're right about the poor
souls who need a helping hand.

241
00:17:21,613 --> 00:17:23,808
I need to take a walk.

242
00:17:27,173 --> 00:17:28,367
Oh, dear.

243
00:17:35,173 --> 00:17:40,201
-Oh! I'm exhausted.
-Poor baby, been lifting your wallet?

244
00:17:40,413 --> 00:17:44,167
No! I've decided to give
my money away...

245
00:17:44,413 --> 00:17:46,369
...to truly needy causes!

246
00:17:46,573 --> 00:17:50,612
But $100,000 just
isn't enough. I need more.

247
00:17:50,933 --> 00:17:53,891
Why don't you go on the
gambling junket?

248
00:17:54,093 --> 00:17:56,129
You could double your money.

249
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:59,325
-Tempting.
-They got a 99-cent shrimp cocktail.

250
00:17:59,533 --> 00:18:00,727
You've sold me!

251
00:18:03,053 --> 00:18:04,771
Trying to get us killed?

252
00:18:04,973 --> 00:18:08,010
It's too hot, maniac!
Turn on the air already!

253
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:14,044
Hey, mellow out, old dudes,
or I'll jam this baby into a river!

254
00:18:17,173 --> 00:18:20,051
I'm looking for Abe Simpson.
It's important.

255
00:18:20,253 --> 00:18:23,723
I don't care about his
money, I love him!

256
00:18:23,933 --> 00:18:27,369
We get that a lot. He left with
the casino junket.

257
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,047
Casino!

258
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,325
Come on, everybody!

259
00:18:43,213 --> 00:18:44,771
Hello, I'm Plato.

260
00:18:44,973 --> 00:18:49,091
Please partake of keno, craps
and the town's loosest slots.

261
00:18:49,373 --> 00:18:52,365
My philosophy is: Enjoy!

262
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,766
Change, please.

263
00:19:01,053 --> 00:19:02,964
Burger, onion rings, shake!

264
00:19:03,213 --> 00:19:05,204
And for God's sake, hurry!

265
00:19:05,413 --> 00:19:08,723
$5000 on-- What century is this?

266
00:19:08,933 --> 00:19:10,810
-The 20th.
-Put it on 20.

267
00:19:11,053 --> 00:19:12,088
Excuse me.

268
00:19:12,293 --> 00:19:15,968
Have you seen an old man?
He looks like me only wrinkled.

269
00:19:16,213 --> 00:19:17,612
Have you seen--? Dad!

270
00:19:18,093 --> 00:19:19,492
No!

271
00:19:21,053 --> 00:19:25,365
-20 black.
-Holy moly, you're winning!

272
00:19:25,573 --> 00:19:27,131
You're cramping me.

273
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,769
Quit while you're ahead, understand?
You gotta leave!

274
00:19:30,973 --> 00:19:35,330
-I have to get enough for everybody.
-But you could lose everything!

275
00:19:35,533 --> 00:19:39,685
Homer, I think Rudyard Kipling
said it best.

276
00:19:39,893 --> 00:19:45,889
"If you can make one heap of all your
winnings and risk it on one turn...

277
00:19:46,093 --> 00:19:49,722
...and lose, and start
again at your beginnings...

278
00:19:49,933 --> 00:19:53,323
...and never breathe a word
about your loss...

279
00:19:53,533 --> 00:19:59,005
...yours is the earth and
everything that's in it...

280
00:19:59,213 --> 00:20:02,683
...and, which is more,
you'll be a man, my son."

281
00:20:02,893 --> 00:20:06,090
-You'll be a bonehead!
-Put it all on 41 .

282
00:20:06,293 --> 00:20:09,251
-I've got a feeling.
-The wheel only goes to 36.

283
00:20:09,453 --> 00:20:12,490
Put it all on 36. I've got a feeling.

284
00:20:12,733 --> 00:20:15,293
Dad, no! Give me that money!

285
00:20:15,573 --> 00:20:18,610
Come on! Stop it! Ow! Ow!
You're hurting me!

286
00:20:19,173 --> 00:20:21,209
-36!
-No more bets.

287
00:20:21,733 --> 00:20:24,566
Son, if this lands on 36, I'll....

288
00:20:25,093 --> 00:20:26,412
Double zero.

289
00:20:26,653 --> 00:20:29,804
Son! You saved me from losing
all my money.

290
00:20:30,053 --> 00:20:32,886
For the first time,
I'm glad I had children.

291
00:20:33,133 --> 00:20:37,285
So have you figured out
who gets the money?

292
00:20:44,173 --> 00:20:47,085
Yes, Homer, I have.

293
00:20:59,213 --> 00:21:04,492
Come on in. Dignity's on me, friends.
