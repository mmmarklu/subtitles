1
00:01:21,004 --> 00:01:24,836
Bart, no more interruptions
during Martin's book report.

2
00:01:25,091 --> 00:01:29,552
Never have I seen a more
noble thing than you, brother.

3
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:35,760
I do not care who kills who.

4
00:01:36,019 --> 00:01:41,975
To catch a fish, to kill a bull,
to make love to a woman.

5
00:01:42,234 --> 00:01:45,852
To live. I thank you.

6
00:01:46,071 --> 00:01:48,527
Oh, absolutely brilliant!

7
00:01:48,866 --> 00:01:53,113
I truly believed you were Hemingway.
Bravo, Martin.

8
00:01:53,329 --> 00:01:57,576
-Call me Papa.
-Some ketchup for your buns, Papa?

9
00:01:57,791 --> 00:02:01,837
We have time for one more report.
Bart Simpson?

10
00:02:02,045 --> 00:02:04,502
Is your book report ready?

11
00:02:04,716 --> 00:02:10,220
Is it ready? What a question!
Students, prepare to be dazzled.

12
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:16,100
The name of the book that
I read was Treasure Island.

13
00:02:16,352 --> 00:02:18,594
It's about these pirates...

14
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:23,606
...with patches over their eyes
and shiny gold teeth.

15
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:27,893
And green birds on their shoulders.

16
00:02:28,364 --> 00:02:32,777
Did I mention it was written
by Robert Louis Stevenson?

17
00:02:33,036 --> 00:02:35,491
And published by McGraw-Hill.

18
00:02:35,747 --> 00:02:39,412
So in conclusion,
on a scale of 1 to 10...

19
00:02:39,667 --> 00:02:44,164
...10 being the highest, 1 the lowest,
and 5 average, I give it...

20
00:02:44,381 --> 00:02:46,457
...a 9.

21
00:02:46,716 --> 00:02:49,586
Questions? No?
Then I'll sit down.

22
00:02:49,844 --> 00:02:51,387
Did you read the book?

23
00:02:51,597 --> 00:02:55,760
I'm insulted.
Is this a book report or a witch hunt?

24
00:02:55,975 --> 00:03:00,056
Then perhaps you'll tell us
the name of the pirate.

25
00:03:00,271 --> 00:03:03,890
Blackbeard, Captain Nemo,
Captain Hook, Bluebeard.

26
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:08,019
-Bluebeard?
-Sit down. I'll see you after class.

27
00:03:09,198 --> 00:03:11,735
Your grades have gotten worse.

28
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:14,026
-Did you know that?
-Yes, ma'am.

29
00:03:14,245 --> 00:03:18,076
-Did you know there's a test tomorrow?
-Yes, ma'am.

30
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:21,327
-Blah, blah, blah, blah.
-Yes, ma'am.

31
00:03:21,544 --> 00:03:24,497
-Blah, blah, blah.
-Yes, ma'am.

32
00:03:24,713 --> 00:03:27,963
-You haven't been paying attention!
-Yes, ma'am.

33
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:30,381
Then what did I say?

34
00:03:30,636 --> 00:03:33,886
-Straighten up and fly right?
-Lucky guess.

35
00:03:36,892 --> 00:03:38,849
Take that, granny!

36
00:03:39,103 --> 00:03:42,935
Hide! Deadly mothballs.
Granny's kissing me!

37
00:03:43,149 --> 00:03:49,317
You reached the level of ungrateful
grandchild. Try again, if you dare!

38
00:03:51,991 --> 00:03:55,277
A couple more games
and I'll hit the books.

39
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:14,510
Soup's on!
Hurry up, or it'll get that skin.

40
00:04:14,723 --> 00:04:16,514
I hate that icky soup skin.

41
00:04:16,725 --> 00:04:19,595
After dinner,
it's down to business.

42
00:04:20,562 --> 00:04:24,690
-Marge, get me another beer.
-Wait, Lisa has some news.

43
00:04:24,941 --> 00:04:30,232
-He doesn't care, Mom.
-I do. I want a beer while I'm caring.

44
00:04:30,447 --> 00:04:32,523
Homer! Go ahead, Lisa.

45
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,861
I got an A on my vocabulary test.

46
00:04:36,328 --> 00:04:42,366
You did! Well, that's just....
Oh, what a glorious day!

47
00:04:42,585 --> 00:04:46,748
Hand me your paper.
I'll put it on the refrigerator.

48
00:04:47,089 --> 00:04:51,087
I might as well kill
two birds with one stone.

49
00:04:51,301 --> 00:04:52,962
You covered up my paper!

50
00:04:53,179 --> 00:04:56,797
Look at those funny little whiskers.
That reminds me.

51
00:04:57,057 --> 00:04:59,679
It's Gorilla Week
on Million Dollar Movie.

52
00:04:59,893 --> 00:05:02,219
No, Dad, I should really--

53
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:08,685
Gorilla the Conqueror.
The granddaddy of them all.

54
00:05:10,071 --> 00:05:13,155
Well, maybe just one more hour.

55
00:05:16,035 --> 00:05:19,653
It's so unfair.
Just because he's different.

56
00:05:19,914 --> 00:05:22,286
Time to hit the books.

57
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:25,211
Burning the candle
at both ends, boy?

58
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:29,578
All right, let's take care
of some business.

59
00:05:29,841 --> 00:05:32,249
"Chapter One: A Dream of Freedom.

60
00:05:32,468 --> 00:05:38,138
On September 15, 1620, separatists
from the Church of England...

61
00:05:38,349 --> 00:05:43,307
...some living in Holland,
left Plymouth, England.

62
00:05:44,772 --> 00:05:48,438
Their destination was...."

63
00:05:49,986 --> 00:05:53,984
Marge, come take a look at this.

64
00:05:54,241 --> 00:05:58,369
The little tiger tries so hard.
Why does he keep failing?

65
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,870
Just a little dim, I guess.

66
00:06:03,417 --> 00:06:07,082
Bart, you're gonna miss your bus.

67
00:06:07,337 --> 00:06:10,089
Hey, Bart-dude.
You look freaked.

68
00:06:10,298 --> 00:06:14,426
I got a test I'm not ready for.
Can you crash the bus?

69
00:06:14,636 --> 00:06:19,512
Sorry, I can't do it on purpose.
But maybe you'll get lucky.

70
00:06:19,725 --> 00:06:24,802
Okay, don't panic. Find an egghead
and pump him for some answers.

71
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:31,106
I bet he didn't study again.

72
00:06:31,362 --> 00:06:36,024
-Now he'll try to get answers from us.
-He's pathetic.

73
00:06:36,242 --> 00:06:38,863
-Morning, girls.
-Good morning, Bart.

74
00:06:39,078 --> 00:06:43,158
Who's up for a cram session?
I'll go first.

75
00:06:43,374 --> 00:06:47,586
-Name the pilgrim's boat.
-The Spirit of St. Louis.

76
00:06:47,795 --> 00:06:50,251
-Where'd they land?
-Sunny Acapulco.

77
00:06:50,465 --> 00:06:53,667
-Why'd they leave England?
-Giant rats.

78
00:06:53,885 --> 00:06:56,921
Cool, history's coming alive.

79
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:02,808
I don't know why I should care...

80
00:07:03,061 --> 00:07:07,769
...but the information that
you just received is erroneous.

81
00:07:07,982 --> 00:07:09,227
You're saying--

82
00:07:09,442 --> 00:07:15,112
A blindfolded chimp with a pencil in
his teeth has more chances than you.

83
00:07:15,323 --> 00:07:18,194
Thanks for the pep talk.

84
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:22,361
All right, take one
and pass the rest back.

85
00:07:22,581 --> 00:07:26,080
Think, Simpson!
Crisis brings out the best in you.

86
00:07:28,712 --> 00:07:35,544
-What is it, Bart?
-Nothing. Must. Take. Test.

87
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:51,441
-What's the matter, son?
-Stabbing pains in my stomach.

88
00:07:51,652 --> 00:07:53,775
Oh, dear, I've heard of this.

89
00:07:54,029 --> 00:07:57,446
-Do you feel pain in your arm?
-Both arms.

90
00:07:57,699 --> 00:08:02,825
-Temporary loss of vision?
-Who said that? Come closer.

91
00:08:05,374 --> 00:08:06,952
Yes, dear?

92
00:08:07,168 --> 00:08:11,581
Maybe one more dish.
Make it cappuccino chocolate fudge.

93
00:08:12,173 --> 00:08:15,258
Your third bowl.
I think you're on the mend.

94
00:08:15,509 --> 00:08:18,083
Anything else I can get you?

95
00:08:18,304 --> 00:08:21,424
-Perhaps the TV?
-Of course. Homer!

96
00:08:21,682 --> 00:08:22,714
What?

97
00:08:22,976 --> 00:08:26,759
Bring the TV up.
Bart's got his vision back!

98
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:30,601
I wish I had amoria phlebitis.

99
00:08:31,025 --> 00:08:34,524
-I know you're faking it.
-Keep your mouth shut.

100
00:08:34,737 --> 00:08:40,158
-You'll still fail that test.
-I've got my bases covered.

101
00:08:40,535 --> 00:08:42,527
Milhouse, what'd I miss today?

102
00:08:42,746 --> 00:08:45,497
Richard laughed milk through his nose.

103
00:08:45,707 --> 00:08:49,539
What about that history test?
Piece of cake?

104
00:08:49,753 --> 00:08:52,670
What'd you get for number one?

105
00:08:53,214 --> 00:08:56,335
Number two?
Yeah, that sounds right.

106
00:08:59,429 --> 00:09:03,758
Here you go, Mrs. Krabappel.
You'll be pleasantly surprised.

107
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:10,638
This test is worse than Milhouse's!

108
00:09:10,899 --> 00:09:15,110
Bart, I warned you.
This is the final straw!

109
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:20,196
You know our district psychiatrist,
Dr. J. Loren Pryor.

110
00:09:20,451 --> 00:09:21,910
Hey, Dr. J.

111
00:09:22,078 --> 00:09:27,950
This is a classic case of what
laymen refer to as "fear of failure."

112
00:09:28,209 --> 00:09:32,835
Bart is an underachiever,
yet he seems to be....

113
00:09:33,088 --> 00:09:36,292
How should I put this?
Proud of it.

114
00:09:37,426 --> 00:09:40,629
One of his problems
is a short attention span.

115
00:09:40,888 --> 00:09:42,880
Blah, blah, blah.

116
00:09:48,313 --> 00:09:53,390
Bart failed his last four exams.
Is there anything you haven't told us?

117
00:09:53,651 --> 00:09:57,400
Everyone else in the class
has shown some improvement.

118
00:09:57,614 --> 00:10:00,947
-Yet you continue to struggle. Why?
-I don't know.

119
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:06,913
Look at these results: 55, 42, 26.
A 12 on state capitals!

120
00:10:07,165 --> 00:10:10,415
Why are we dancing around the obvious?

121
00:10:10,626 --> 00:10:13,165
We all know it. I'm dumb as a post.

122
00:10:13,421 --> 00:10:17,122
-Think I'm happy?
-You're just a late bloomer.

123
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:18,878
It isn't that simple.

124
00:10:19,135 --> 00:10:24,889
As emotionally crippling as it may be,
my recommendation is for Bart to...

125
00:10:25,142 --> 00:10:27,384
...repeat the fourth grade.

126
00:10:27,644 --> 00:10:31,309
-You can't! I'll do better!
-That'll be the day.

127
00:10:31,565 --> 00:10:36,855
Maybe it would help him to be
left back. It won't be so bad.

128
00:10:37,112 --> 00:10:40,316
You can't hold me back.
I swear I'll do better.

129
00:10:40,574 --> 00:10:44,239
Look in my eyes.
See the sincerity? See the fear?

130
00:10:44,453 --> 00:10:48,236
As God is my witness,
I can pass the fourth grade!

131
00:10:48,582 --> 00:10:53,160
If not, at least you'll be
bigger than the other kids.

132
00:10:54,629 --> 00:10:59,007
Get off the bus and forever
hold your peace, little dudes.

133
00:10:59,301 --> 00:11:04,925
Otto, I respect you. You let us throw
stuff at cars and try to tip the bus.

134
00:11:05,141 --> 00:11:09,601
Damn thing never goes over, does it?
So what's in your head?

135
00:11:09,979 --> 00:11:13,810
I've been failing
a lot of tests recently.

136
00:11:14,024 --> 00:11:17,690
They'll hold me back
if I don't shape up.

137
00:11:18,362 --> 00:11:23,439
That's it? Relax, man. It could
be the best thing to happen to you.

138
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:27,443
I got held back in the fourth grade.
Twice.

139
00:11:27,705 --> 00:11:33,079
And look at me, man.
Now I drive the school bus!

140
00:11:34,754 --> 00:11:40,175
My recommendation is for Bart
to repeat the fourth grade.

141
00:11:42,762 --> 00:11:46,381
All right, class,
the topic is world literature.

142
00:11:46,599 --> 00:11:51,760
What was the pirate's name in
Treasure Island, Bart Simpson?

143
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:57,899
I got a peptic ulcer, my wife wants
a new car and I need a root canal.

144
00:11:58,153 --> 00:12:02,281
-Quit bugging me about the pirate.
-Long John Silver, Dad.

145
00:12:02,532 --> 00:12:08,322
I heard that, Bart Jr.
I want to see both of you after class.

146
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,822
Thanks a lot, son.

147
00:12:14,712 --> 00:12:16,918
Yo, little help!

148
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:20,831
I said little help.
Throw me the ball, Poindexter.

149
00:12:21,051 --> 00:12:24,836
I'm sorry, Bart.
I don't know the rules of your sport.

150
00:12:25,055 --> 00:12:28,720
I didn't want to interfere
with a ball in play.

151
00:12:30,894 --> 00:12:33,849
Back to the forecastle of the Pequod.

152
00:12:34,982 --> 00:12:38,682
-Hey, Martin.
-I have nothing of value.

153
00:12:38,903 --> 00:12:40,860
Help me get a passing grade.

154
00:12:41,072 --> 00:12:47,074
You need someone's help, but I don't
know why that someone should be me.

155
00:12:47,328 --> 00:12:51,491
I can make it so the other kids
don't laugh at you.

156
00:12:51,749 --> 00:12:56,909
They laugh at me? I'd always
considered myself rather popular.

157
00:12:57,129 --> 00:12:59,537
You're not. Watch.

158
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:07,337
My speed with numbers,
my years as a hall monitor...

159
00:13:07,556 --> 00:13:12,100
...my prize-winning dioramas,
they mean nothing to them?

160
00:13:12,312 --> 00:13:15,431
Perhaps another demonstration.

161
00:13:16,441 --> 00:13:20,438
-Very well, you've made your point.
-Then it's a deal?

162
00:13:20,612 --> 00:13:21,892
Yes.

163
00:13:22,113 --> 00:13:26,028
-Let's have a look at your study area.
-Study area?

164
00:13:26,242 --> 00:13:29,529
Your sanctuary from
the frenzy of modern life.

165
00:13:29,871 --> 00:13:33,406
There's a desk under that junk.

166
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,784
No, this won't do at all.

167
00:13:36,003 --> 00:13:39,703
We have to clean up this room.
And we'll need a fern.

168
00:13:39,965 --> 00:13:42,919
No room is complete
without plant life.

169
00:13:44,928 --> 00:13:49,970
No. Geeks sit in the front.
From now on, you sit in the back row.

170
00:13:50,184 --> 00:13:53,220
That goes for school and church too.

171
00:13:53,479 --> 00:13:57,559
-Why?
-So no one can see what you're doing.

172
00:13:57,775 --> 00:13:59,435
I understand.

173
00:13:59,651 --> 00:14:04,148
Mischief varies inversely with
proximity to the authority figure.

174
00:14:04,365 --> 00:14:07,117
Yeah, but don't say it like that.

175
00:14:45,699 --> 00:14:48,949
Soon you'll be ready to try it
with a real book.

176
00:14:52,706 --> 00:14:56,786
Pushing a boy into the girls' lavatory
was such a thrill!

177
00:14:57,044 --> 00:15:01,207
The screams, the humiliation,
the fact that it wasn't me!

178
00:15:01,422 --> 00:15:06,001
-I've never felt so alive.
-Now, the test is tomorrow--

179
00:15:06,261 --> 00:15:10,045
Who cares about some test?
Life's too short!

180
00:15:10,265 --> 00:15:12,886
I thought we had a deal.

181
00:15:13,143 --> 00:15:18,304
The old Martin no longer exists.
Come on, fellows, to the arcade!

182
00:15:18,565 --> 00:15:20,604
Cool, Martin!

183
00:15:20,859 --> 00:15:23,860
Martin! Martin! Martin!

184
00:15:30,119 --> 00:15:35,196
-Bart, it's past your bedtime.
-Okay.

185
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:37,782
This is hopeless.

186
00:15:40,546 --> 00:15:45,623
This is the end of the road.
I haven't always been a good kid.

187
00:15:45,885 --> 00:15:50,214
But if I go to school tomorrow,
I'll fail and be held back.

188
00:15:50,472 --> 00:15:54,601
I need one more day to study, Lord.
I need your help.

189
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:57,266
Prayer, the last refuge
of a scoundrel.

190
00:15:57,522 --> 00:16:02,943
A teacher strike, a power failure.
Anything that'll cancel school.

191
00:16:03,194 --> 00:16:07,903
I know it's asking a lot,
but if anyone can do it, you can.

192
00:16:08,158 --> 00:16:12,238
Thanking you in advance,
your pal, Bart Simpson.

193
00:16:31,264 --> 00:16:35,843
Wake up, Bart.
Rise and shine, little guy.

194
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,136
Oh, no.

195
00:16:38,396 --> 00:16:40,769
Wake up and look at the snow.

196
00:16:41,149 --> 00:16:44,518
Whoa! Good morning, world!

197
00:16:44,736 --> 00:16:47,856
It's the Bill and Marty Show.

198
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:49,864
-He's Bill.
-He's Marty.

199
00:16:50,117 --> 00:16:52,276
We can't get enough of each other.

200
00:16:52,494 --> 00:16:56,444
We've got snow-formation
for you flake lovers.

201
00:16:56,665 --> 00:16:59,500
The gas and water plants are closed.

202
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:03,079
And the nuclear power plant.
That's closed too.

203
00:17:03,339 --> 00:17:05,082
All right!

204
00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:08,833
Now, for all you youngsters,
here it is.

205
00:17:09,053 --> 00:17:11,590
Springfield county schools are--

206
00:17:11,805 --> 00:17:13,597
Oh, I'm too excited!

207
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:16,969
Springfield schools will be closed!

208
00:17:17,185 --> 00:17:19,226
All right!

209
00:17:22,316 --> 00:17:26,100
Come back, you're supposed
to eat breakfast!

210
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:27,977
Cowabunga!

211
00:17:28,197 --> 00:17:31,946
Remember to take a break
if your arms go numb!

212
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:37,402
Last night, you prayed for this.
Now your prayers have been answered.

213
00:17:37,624 --> 00:17:40,957
I don't know who
or what God is exactly.

214
00:17:41,211 --> 00:17:45,125
But he's more powerful
than Mom and Dad put together.

215
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,166
And you owe him big.

216
00:17:47,342 --> 00:17:52,419
You're right. I asked for a miracle,
and I got it. I gotta study.

217
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:00,145
I'm not missing anything.
Frozen ears.

218
00:18:00,355 --> 00:18:05,516
Trudging up that stupid sled hill
over and over. How good could it be?

219
00:18:18,623 --> 00:18:21,293
I haven't had this much fun in years.

220
00:18:21,501 --> 00:18:23,162
Gotcha, Burnsie.

221
00:18:23,837 --> 00:18:28,167
I was never one to back away
from a snowball fight.

222
00:18:28,425 --> 00:18:30,963
-Smithers, fire at will.
-Certainly.

223
00:18:36,141 --> 00:18:40,186
I hereby declare this day
to be Snow Day...

224
00:18:40,395 --> 00:18:44,524
...the funnest day
in the history of Springfield!

225
00:19:07,632 --> 00:19:09,708
Gotta study, gotta study!

226
00:19:13,596 --> 00:19:16,003
"Four Days in Philadelphia.

227
00:19:16,266 --> 00:19:19,220
The first Congress
faced a difficult job.

228
00:19:19,436 --> 00:19:23,564
Could they make decisions
that Americans could support?"

229
00:19:23,773 --> 00:19:26,478
We hold these truths
to be self-evident.

230
00:19:26,734 --> 00:19:30,151
We hold these truths
to be self-evident.

231
00:19:30,363 --> 00:19:33,198
That all men are created equal.

232
00:19:33,408 --> 00:19:37,276
That from that equal creation,
they derive rights--

233
00:19:37,495 --> 00:19:40,069
Look, everybody!
It's snowing!

234
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:43,125
-In the middle of July?
-It's a miracle.

235
00:19:43,335 --> 00:19:46,455
I've invented something fun.
The sled.

236
00:19:50,175 --> 00:19:54,552
Look, John Hancock's
writing his name in the snow!

237
00:19:58,934 --> 00:20:03,347
Do you want to be held back a grade?
Concentrate, man!

238
00:20:11,697 --> 00:20:14,188
Later, Mrs. K.

239
00:20:16,994 --> 00:20:21,406
Please turn in your exam, Bart.
Class is over.

240
00:20:21,624 --> 00:20:25,039
-Could you grade it now?
-Well, all right.

241
00:20:25,294 --> 00:20:27,963
Let me get Old Red.

242
00:20:32,968 --> 00:20:35,720
It's a 59. That's another F.

243
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:38,468
Oh, no, I can't believe it.

244
00:20:38,683 --> 00:20:44,022
I know. Another year together.
It's gonna be hell.

245
00:20:49,235 --> 00:20:53,398
What's the matter?
I thought you'd be used to failing.

246
00:20:53,656 --> 00:20:58,900
No, you don't understand.
I tried this time. I really tried.

247
00:20:59,162 --> 00:21:00,572
There, there.

248
00:21:00,997 --> 00:21:04,366
This is as good as I can do,
and I still failed.

249
00:21:04,626 --> 00:21:07,580
Well, a 59. It's a high F.

250
00:21:07,837 --> 00:21:12,167
Who am I kidding?
I really am a failure.

251
00:21:12,801 --> 00:21:19,599
Now I know how Washington felt when
he surrendered Fort Necessity in 1754.

252
00:21:19,808 --> 00:21:23,473
You know, 1754.
The famous defeat to the French.

253
00:21:23,729 --> 00:21:26,433
-My God, Bart, you're right!
-So?

254
00:21:26,649 --> 00:21:29,222
You demonstrated applied knowledge.

255
00:21:29,443 --> 00:21:35,563
Such an obscure reference deserves
an extra point. It's only fair.

256
00:21:35,783 --> 00:21:39,282
-You mean I passed?
-Just barely.

257
00:21:39,495 --> 00:21:42,946
I passed. I got a D minus!
I passed!

258
00:21:43,165 --> 00:21:45,123
All right!

259
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:49,540
I passed! I passed! I passed!
I got a D minus!

260
00:21:49,755 --> 00:21:53,171
I got a D minus! I passed!
I got a D minus!

261
00:21:53,384 --> 00:21:55,792
I passed! l--

262
00:21:56,011 --> 00:21:59,796
Kissed the teacher?!

263
00:22:04,562 --> 00:22:06,020
We're proud of you.

264
00:22:06,272 --> 00:22:11,433
Thanks, Dad, but part of
this D minus belongs to God.
