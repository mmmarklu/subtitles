1
00:00:05,733 --> 00:00:07,451
Lisa's Substitute

2
00:00:27,133 --> 00:00:30,489
Hear about Miss Hoover?
She drank some drain cleaner.

3
00:00:30,693 --> 00:00:33,526
I heard she fell down a well.

4
00:00:34,573 --> 00:00:35,642
Come on, now.

5
00:00:35,973 --> 00:00:37,884
She's been dumped again.

6
00:00:38,093 --> 00:00:43,292
I won't be staying long. I just
learned I have Lyme disease.

7
00:00:43,533 --> 00:00:46,366
Principal Skinner will stay
until a sub comes.

8
00:00:46,573 --> 00:00:48,370
-What's Lyme disease?
-I know.

9
00:00:48,573 --> 00:00:51,770
Lyme disease is spread by ticks.

10
00:00:52,173 --> 00:00:55,085
When a tick begins
to suck your blood...

11
00:00:55,293 --> 00:00:59,684
...spirochetes infest your blood and
spinal fluid and then the brain.

12
00:00:59,933 --> 00:01:02,891
The brain. Oh, dear God!

13
00:01:03,173 --> 00:01:04,731
Come on, Elizabeth.

14
00:01:04,973 --> 00:01:07,533
Well, now, children, here we are.

15
00:01:07,733 --> 00:01:12,523
Open your primers to page 32.
Ah, subtraction!

16
00:01:13,493 --> 00:01:17,281
Bart Simpson, I know it's you!

17
00:01:17,973 --> 00:01:21,522
And here comes Snowball II.
We kept this one.

18
00:01:21,773 --> 00:01:24,685
The mother ate the gray one.

19
00:01:24,893 --> 00:01:27,487
Mrs. Krabappel,
he's traumatizing us.

20
00:01:27,693 --> 00:01:31,129
I agree.
Bart, shut that off and sit down.

21
00:01:31,373 --> 00:01:36,083
Look, this is cool. When I hit
reverse, I can make them go back in.

22
00:01:40,293 --> 00:01:46,084
No, you're not seeing things.
This, my little friends, is a schwa.

23
00:01:50,173 --> 00:01:52,482
-Are you the substitute?
-I am.

24
00:01:52,693 --> 00:01:55,924
-Are you insane?
-It's how I get their attention.

25
00:01:56,133 --> 00:02:00,285
All right. Play friendly with
your new teacher, children.

26
00:02:00,493 --> 00:02:03,485
Howdy. I'm a Texas cowboy from 1830.

27
00:02:03,693 --> 00:02:07,732
-Ask me anything you like.
-Can we play kickball?

28
00:02:07,973 --> 00:02:12,524
Kickball? There ain't no kickball
in 1830. Any other questions?

29
00:02:12,773 --> 00:02:14,684
Shoot! It's awfully quiet.

30
00:02:14,933 --> 00:02:19,643
Well, how about this?
I want to see both eyes up here.

31
00:02:19,853 --> 00:02:23,846
There are three things wrong
with my costume. Name them...

32
00:02:24,053 --> 00:02:25,725
...and you get my hat.

33
00:02:25,973 --> 00:02:28,931
-I know the answer.
-What's your name?

34
00:02:29,133 --> 00:02:31,283
-Lisa Simpson.
-Well, go ahead.

35
00:02:31,493 --> 00:02:36,123
Your belt says "State of Texas, "
but it wasn't a state until 1845.

36
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:37,482
Very good.

37
00:02:37,693 --> 00:02:41,288
-The revolver wasn't around till 1835.
-Excellent.

38
00:02:41,493 --> 00:02:43,211
You seem to be Jewish.

39
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:44,732
-You sure?
-Italian?

40
00:02:44,933 --> 00:02:47,128
-Jewish.
-Cowboys aren't Jewish.

41
00:02:47,373 --> 00:02:51,127
Good! I also have a digital watch,
but I'll accept that.

42
00:02:51,373 --> 00:02:54,410
For the record, there were
some Jewish cowboys.

43
00:02:54,613 --> 00:02:57,002
Big guys who spent money freely.

44
00:02:57,213 --> 00:03:00,489
I'm Mr. Bergstrom.
You can make fun of my name.

45
00:03:00,693 --> 00:03:04,652
Two suggestions are Mr. Nerd-strom
and Mr. Booger-strom.

46
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:09,562
Today we will begin
selecting a class president.

47
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:13,322
I can't vote, but I
suggest Martin. Martin?

48
00:03:13,573 --> 00:03:17,771
As president, I would demand a
science fiction library...

49
00:03:18,013 --> 00:03:22,291
...featuring an ABC of the
overlords of the genre:

50
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:25,690
-Asimov, Bester, Clarke--
-What about Bradbury?

51
00:03:25,933 --> 00:03:31,769
I'm aware of his work.
Thank you, and keep watching the skies.

52
00:03:31,973 --> 00:03:34,612
Excellent! Excellent, Martin!

53
00:03:35,133 --> 00:03:39,524
If you're through with your pemmican,
why don't we sing a song?

54
00:03:39,773 --> 00:03:43,891
This one's not very accurate,
but we'll fix it. Okay?

55
00:03:48,373 --> 00:03:51,490
Actually, the range was
far from home.

56
00:03:51,693 --> 00:03:55,083
It was a desolate place
of danger and disease.

57
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:01,689
Unlike the efficient Indians...

58
00:04:01,933 --> 00:04:05,892
...cowboys used only
the tongue of the antelope.

59
00:04:16,733 --> 00:04:18,724
What's this? Did you do it?

60
00:04:18,973 --> 00:04:21,692
No! I would never do
anything like that.

61
00:04:21,933 --> 00:04:24,322
It was one of those immature--

62
00:04:24,573 --> 00:04:27,133
-Can I have it?
-Yes, but I didn't do it.

63
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:31,121
-Are you sure you didn't? It's good.
-I wish I had.

64
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:33,483
Class, "The Singing Dork."

65
00:04:33,693 --> 00:04:35,888
Lisa!

66
00:04:38,533 --> 00:04:43,129
-Any more nominations?
-We nominate Bart Simpson! Speech!

67
00:04:43,373 --> 00:04:45,728
I had a speech, but my dog ate it.

68
00:04:45,973 --> 00:04:50,808
Children! Bart, I need someone
to deliver a note to the principal.

69
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:57,928
-Would you do it?
-But where's the principal's office?

70
00:05:00,773 --> 00:05:03,241
What did I say about encouraging him?

71
00:05:03,453 --> 00:05:06,172
When Bart wins approval
for being a fool--

72
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:08,489
Yay, Bart!

73
00:05:08,893 --> 00:05:10,849
Bart! Bart! Bart!

74
00:05:13,933 --> 00:05:19,166
"Nobody, of the hundreds of people
that visited the fair...

75
00:05:20,093 --> 00:05:25,451
...knew that a gray spider had played
the most important part of all.

76
00:05:25,653 --> 00:05:29,885
No one was with her when she died."

77
00:05:33,293 --> 00:05:35,887
Come on, everybody has a talent.

78
00:05:36,133 --> 00:05:38,806
-I wanna see yours.
-I don't have one.

79
00:05:39,013 --> 00:05:42,722
There has to be something
you do better than anyone.

80
00:05:42,973 --> 00:05:47,410
-Well, I can do this.
-Yes! Great!

81
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:49,524
How about you, Ralph?

82
00:05:49,733 --> 00:05:51,132
Wonderful!

83
00:05:51,373 --> 00:05:52,931
Chuck?

84
00:05:53,173 --> 00:05:55,164
Disgusting. I love it!

85
00:05:55,373 --> 00:05:58,683
Lisa, you're holding out.
I see a saxophone!

86
00:05:58,933 --> 00:06:01,527
-I can't.
-Come on. I bet you're good.

87
00:06:01,733 --> 00:06:03,928
-I can't.
-Sure you can.

88
00:06:04,173 --> 00:06:07,404
-Please don't make me do it.
-You owe me one.

89
00:06:12,933 --> 00:06:15,128
While I'm technically married...

90
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:21,090
...it hasn't been much of a marriage
since Mr. Krabappel moved out.

91
00:06:21,293 --> 00:06:23,966
This profession
can strain a marriage.

92
00:06:24,173 --> 00:06:29,805
I've been looking for a substitute
to teach me a lesson I sorely need.

93
00:06:30,013 --> 00:06:33,289
Mrs. Krabappel,
you're trying to seduce me.

94
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:34,642
Well?

95
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:38,846
I'm sorry. You're very nice,
but it's the children I love.

96
00:07:04,013 --> 00:07:08,291
Mr. Bergstrom is the first thing
I think of when I wake up.

97
00:07:08,493 --> 00:07:10,529
I feel that way about Homer.

98
00:07:10,733 --> 00:07:12,405
You don't understand.

99
00:07:12,613 --> 00:07:15,127
When he smiles, you see these teeth.

100
00:07:15,373 --> 00:07:19,127
But when he laughs, you see these.
The eyeteeth.

101
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:22,769
I don't know if he had braces,
but they're perfect.

102
00:07:22,973 --> 00:07:25,487
I notice little things about Homer.

103
00:07:25,693 --> 00:07:30,050
Mom, this man makes you feel
like there's nobody better.

104
00:07:30,253 --> 00:07:33,962
-So does Homer.
-Mom, are we gonna talk or what?

105
00:07:34,173 --> 00:07:37,927
You have to accept that
I feel that way about your father.

106
00:07:38,173 --> 00:07:39,162
Fine.

107
00:07:39,533 --> 00:07:44,926
Yesterday, he read us Charlotte's Web
and cried at the end.

108
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:50,687
A book made him cry!

109
00:07:54,973 --> 00:07:59,808
Nobody gets back in after
lunch without one igneous rock...

110
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:02,891
...that's volcanic,
and one sedimentary.

111
00:08:03,133 --> 00:08:05,567
-Lisa, can I see you?
-Yes!

112
00:08:05,773 --> 00:08:06,762
Yes?

113
00:08:06,973 --> 00:08:11,410
Your homework is always so neat.
Does your father help you?

114
00:08:11,613 --> 00:08:15,208
-Homework's not his specialty.
-It's okay. My dad could--

115
00:08:15,373 --> 00:08:16,772
-Not mine.
-Let me finish.

116
00:08:16,933 --> 00:08:19,925
Unless the next word was "burp, "
don't bother.

117
00:08:20,293 --> 00:08:22,488
In a sample taken in our classroom...

118
00:08:22,693 --> 00:08:27,130
...an inspector found 1.74 parts
per million of asbestos!

119
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:30,331
That's not enough!
We demand more asbestos!

120
00:08:30,573 --> 00:08:33,485
More asbestos! More asbestos!

121
00:08:33,733 --> 00:08:35,530
More asbestos!

122
00:08:37,973 --> 00:08:41,522
-You made the front page.
-It's just a popularity contest.

123
00:08:41,733 --> 00:08:46,409
"Just a popularity contest"?
What's more important than popularity?

124
00:08:46,613 --> 00:08:49,889
-Bart, can you really win?
-Sure, why not?

125
00:08:50,133 --> 00:08:52,169
I knew you had personality!

126
00:08:52,373 --> 00:08:55,604
They said it was hyperactivity,
but I knew better!

127
00:08:55,813 --> 00:09:00,489
President Simpson.
Has a nice ring to it, doesn't it, boy?

128
00:09:00,733 --> 00:09:04,328
-Yeah.
-Now, go get them!

129
00:09:04,773 --> 00:09:10,882
He says, there are no easy answers!
I say, he's not looking hard enough!

130
00:09:36,413 --> 00:09:40,122
You never lose appealing
to the lowest common denominator.

131
00:09:40,373 --> 00:09:42,204
-You'll miss Bart.
-When?

132
00:09:42,413 --> 00:09:44,608
When your life takes you places.

133
00:09:44,853 --> 00:09:47,686
Places where my intelligence
will be an asset?

134
00:09:47,893 --> 00:09:50,487
Yes, there is such a place.
Believe me.

135
00:09:50,733 --> 00:09:56,046
I believe everything you say, with
your words and Semitic good looks.

136
00:09:56,413 --> 00:10:00,292
"Dear Miss Hoover: You have Lyme
disease. We miss you.

137
00:10:00,493 --> 00:10:05,647
Kevin's biting me. Here's a drawing
of a spirochete. Love, Ralph."

138
00:10:05,853 --> 00:10:08,208
Oh, that's great, Ralph!

139
00:10:08,453 --> 00:10:11,729
The Springfield Museum
of Natural History...

140
00:10:11,973 --> 00:10:15,204
...will be closing down in two weeks.

141
00:10:15,453 --> 00:10:17,648
Go see it while you can.

142
00:10:19,093 --> 00:10:24,167
Lisa needs to go to the museum,
and I think you should take her.

143
00:10:24,413 --> 00:10:25,482
The museum?

144
00:10:25,693 --> 00:10:30,642
Tomorrow? Oh, Marge, I'd love to,
but I was planning on...

145
00:10:30,853 --> 00:10:35,324
Sleeping? Eating a big sandwich?
TV? Spending time with the boy!

146
00:10:35,533 --> 00:10:37,649
...spending time with the boy.

147
00:10:37,893 --> 00:10:42,569
-I'm concerned about you and Lisa.
-Me too. They're drifting apart.

148
00:10:42,813 --> 00:10:45,008
-Shut up, boy.
-Homer, please.

149
00:10:45,213 --> 00:10:47,681
You don't understand. I can't--

150
00:10:47,893 --> 00:10:52,808
You're trapped. You're not
smart enough to get out of this.

151
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:56,170
All right! I'll take her!
Lousy brain.

152
00:10:59,693 --> 00:11:03,288
-What's a "suggested donation"?
-Pay what you wish.

153
00:11:03,533 --> 00:11:07,412
-And what if I wish to pay zero?
-It's up to you.

154
00:11:07,653 --> 00:11:09,962
-So it's up to me, is it?
-Yes.

155
00:11:10,173 --> 00:11:14,883
And you think that people are
gonna pay you $4.50...

156
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:19,046
...when they don't have to,
out of the goodness of their....

157
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:24,042
Anything you say! Good luck, lady!
You'll need it!

158
00:11:24,493 --> 00:11:26,324
-Mr. Bergstrom!
-Hi, Lisa.

159
00:11:26,573 --> 00:11:31,408
-Hey! You don't have to pay!
-This must be your father.

160
00:11:31,693 --> 00:11:35,686
His teeth were jagged,
but he could swallow you whole.

161
00:11:35,933 --> 00:11:36,922
Wow!

162
00:11:37,133 --> 00:11:40,887
Actually, they do know a great deal
about mummification.

163
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:45,524
First, they pulled the brain out
and stuffed the skull with onions.

164
00:11:45,773 --> 00:11:46,762
Gross!

165
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:51,125
Creepy. But I'd rather have
him after me than the Wolf Man.

166
00:11:51,373 --> 00:11:52,726
Oh, Lord.

167
00:11:59,693 --> 00:12:05,131
I've noticed that Lisa seems to feel
she has no strong male role model.

168
00:12:05,373 --> 00:12:08,490
-She said that?
-No, but, you know, she--

169
00:12:08,693 --> 00:12:12,732
But you can tell, right?
She sees everybody else's dad...

170
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:17,688
...with a good education and says,
"What did I do to deserve this?"

171
00:12:17,893 --> 00:12:22,808
You must be a bigger man. There's
a wonderful girl's future at stake.

172
00:12:23,013 --> 00:12:26,050
-lf she's so great, give her an A.
-I am.

173
00:12:26,253 --> 00:12:29,882
-Great. Tell her she earned it.
-She did earn it.

174
00:12:30,093 --> 00:12:32,766
You are smooth. I'll give you that.

175
00:12:36,813 --> 00:12:41,284
He ruined my chance to get to know
Mr. Bergstrom outside school.

176
00:12:41,493 --> 00:12:45,645
I'll tell you what, why don't
we invite him to dinner?

177
00:12:45,853 --> 00:12:48,083
Oh, Mom, that's wonderful!

178
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:50,324
-Can I help cook?
-Yes.

179
00:12:50,653 --> 00:12:52,689
-Can I wear jewelry?
-Sure.

180
00:12:52,893 --> 00:12:54,690
Dye my shoes?
Paint my nails?

181
00:12:54,893 --> 00:12:57,282
Can we have wine?
Can I have wine?

182
00:12:57,493 --> 00:12:59,848
Does Bart have to be there?

183
00:13:00,573 --> 00:13:04,088
We request the pleasure
of your company-- No.

184
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:07,882
If you're not doing
anything this Friday-- No.

185
00:13:08,093 --> 00:13:12,769
Mr. Bergstrom, do you like pork
chops? Oh, no, of course not.

186
00:13:14,893 --> 00:13:18,647
Good morning, Lisa. I'm back.

187
00:13:22,413 --> 00:13:25,007
My Lyme disease turned
out to be...

188
00:13:25,253 --> 00:13:28,848
-...psychosomatic.
-Does that mean you're crazy?

189
00:13:29,053 --> 00:13:32,409
-It means she was faking.
-It was a little of both.

190
00:13:32,613 --> 00:13:39,007
Sometimes when a disease is on the
news, it's natural to think you have it.

191
00:13:39,213 --> 00:13:41,681
-Where's Mr. Bergstrom?
-Don't know.

192
00:13:41,893 --> 00:13:45,932
But I'd like to talk to him.
He didn't use my lesson plan.

193
00:13:46,173 --> 00:13:50,086
-What did he teach you?
-That life is worth living.

194
00:13:51,173 --> 00:13:54,006
The polls are open
till the end of recess.

195
00:13:54,213 --> 00:13:57,489
In case any of you have
thought about this...

196
00:13:57,693 --> 00:14:00,446
...we'll hear final statements. Martin?

197
00:14:00,653 --> 00:14:03,690
I don't think there's anything
left to say.

198
00:14:03,933 --> 00:14:07,243
-Bart?
-Victory party under the slide!

199
00:14:11,853 --> 00:14:15,050
Mr. Bergstrom! Mr. Bergstrom!

200
00:14:15,253 --> 00:14:20,008
He moved out this morning.
He took his Copernicus costume.

201
00:14:20,213 --> 00:14:21,407
Where is he?

202
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:24,292
He's taking the train to
Capital City.

203
00:14:24,493 --> 00:14:28,771
The train. How like him.
Traditional, yet environmentally sound.

204
00:14:29,013 --> 00:14:32,688
Yes. And it's been the backbone
of our country...

205
00:14:32,893 --> 00:14:36,010
...since Stanford drove in
that golden spike.

206
00:14:36,213 --> 00:14:39,091
I see he touched you too.

207
00:14:39,413 --> 00:14:42,564
-Thanks for your vote.
-Voting's for geeks!

208
00:14:42,813 --> 00:14:44,292
You got that right.

209
00:14:45,053 --> 00:14:47,169
-Thanks for your vote.
-We forgot.

210
00:14:47,413 --> 00:14:51,372
Oh, well, as long as a couple
of people did. Right, Milhouse?

211
00:14:51,573 --> 00:14:52,562
Lewis?

212
00:14:52,773 --> 00:14:56,732
-Somebody must have voted.
-What about you? Didn't you vote?

213
00:15:03,293 --> 00:15:05,045
I demand a re-count.

214
00:15:05,773 --> 00:15:08,970
Two for Martin. Want another re-count?

215
00:15:09,173 --> 00:15:10,970
-No.
-I want to make sure.

216
00:15:11,373 --> 00:15:14,490
One for Martin,
two for Martin.

217
00:15:15,213 --> 00:15:16,771
This way, Mr. President!

218
00:15:20,013 --> 00:15:24,404
Now boarding the Afternoon Delight....

219
00:15:24,893 --> 00:15:26,042
Mr. Bergstrom!

220
00:15:26,253 --> 00:15:28,528
Hey, Lisa.

221
00:15:28,933 --> 00:15:31,686
-Hey, Lisa, indeed!
-What? What is it?

222
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:37,128
Were you just gonna leave,
just like that?

223
00:15:37,373 --> 00:15:38,886
I'm sorry, Lisa.

224
00:15:39,093 --> 00:15:43,132
It's the life of the substitute
teacher. He's a fraud.

225
00:15:43,413 --> 00:15:47,725
Today he wears gym shorts,
tomorrow he speaks French...

226
00:15:47,973 --> 00:15:50,692
...or runs a band saw
or God knows what.

227
00:15:50,893 --> 00:15:53,930
You're the best teacher
I'll ever have.

228
00:15:54,213 --> 00:15:57,444
-That's not true. Others will come.
-Oh, please!

229
00:15:57,653 --> 00:16:02,090
You're right, I'm the best.
But they need me over in Capital City.

230
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:04,483
But I need you too.

231
00:16:04,733 --> 00:16:06,371
When you're middle-class...

232
00:16:06,613 --> 00:16:10,083
...anybody who cares will leave
to help someone needier.

233
00:16:11,813 --> 00:16:13,849
I understand.

234
00:16:14,053 --> 00:16:18,763
Mr. Bergstrom, I'm gonna miss you.

235
00:16:19,773 --> 00:16:22,810
I'll tell you what.
Whenever you feel alone...

236
00:16:23,013 --> 00:16:26,164
...like there's no one you can rely on...

237
00:16:26,453 --> 00:16:28,921
...this is all you need to know.

238
00:16:29,173 --> 00:16:30,970
Thank you, Mr. Bergstrom.

239
00:16:31,173 --> 00:16:34,609
-All aboard!
-So, I guess this is it.

240
00:16:34,813 --> 00:16:38,522
If you don't mind,
I'll run alongside the train...

241
00:16:38,733 --> 00:16:42,089
...as it speeds you from my life.

242
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:55,089
Goodbye, Lisa, honey!

243
00:16:55,333 --> 00:17:00,202
It'll be okay. Just read the note!

244
00:17:05,133 --> 00:17:07,010
Bart didn't get one vote?

245
00:17:07,253 --> 00:17:10,290
This is the worst thing
that could happen!

246
00:17:10,693 --> 00:17:14,925
All right, spilled milk.
What are you so mopey about?

247
00:17:15,173 --> 00:17:17,892
-Nothing.
-Lisa, tell your father.

248
00:17:18,093 --> 00:17:20,209
-Mr. Bergstrom left.
-Oh?

249
00:17:20,453 --> 00:17:23,126
-He's gone. Forever.
-And?

250
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,449
I didn't think you'd
understand.

251
00:17:25,653 --> 00:17:29,612
Just because I don't care
doesn't mean I don't understand.

252
00:17:30,373 --> 00:17:32,284
I'm glad I'm not crying.

253
00:17:32,493 --> 00:17:37,886
I'd hate for you to think that what
I'm gonna say is based on emotion.

254
00:17:38,093 --> 00:17:41,483
But you, sir, are a baboon!

255
00:17:41,733 --> 00:17:45,282
-Me?
-Yes, you! Baboon! Baboon! Baboon!

256
00:17:45,493 --> 00:17:50,692
-You don't realize what you're saying.
-Baboon!

257
00:17:51,293 --> 00:17:54,888
Someone was bound to say it,
but I never expected her.

258
00:17:55,093 --> 00:17:58,768
Did you hear that?
She called me a baboon!

259
00:17:59,013 --> 00:18:01,846
The stupidest and ugliest ape of all!

260
00:18:02,053 --> 00:18:04,692
You're not allowed to be hurt now.

261
00:18:04,933 --> 00:18:07,003
A little girl needs you.

262
00:18:07,213 --> 00:18:09,283
Her confidence in you is shaken...

263
00:18:09,533 --> 00:18:14,084
...and no little girl can be happy
without faith in her daddy.

264
00:18:18,293 --> 00:18:20,124
"Go away."

265
00:18:21,773 --> 00:18:26,722
Lisa, don't hold anything back.
You can tell me.

266
00:18:27,013 --> 00:18:30,449
-You're sad you called me a baboon?
-No!

267
00:18:30,653 --> 00:18:32,086
Nuts.

268
00:18:33,733 --> 00:18:36,008
This isn't going well at all.

269
00:18:36,213 --> 00:18:41,446
-lf you want me to forgive--
-No, I just wish I knew what to say.

270
00:18:43,053 --> 00:18:45,442
But maybe this music will help.

271
00:18:45,653 --> 00:18:49,009
Now, you lost someone special
and it hurt.

272
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,892
I never lost anyone special to me.

273
00:18:52,133 --> 00:18:55,603
Everyone special to me
is under this roof.

274
00:18:55,853 --> 00:19:00,768
It's true. Now, you'll have lots
of special people in your life.

275
00:19:01,013 --> 00:19:03,766
There's probably a place
they hang out...

276
00:19:03,973 --> 00:19:08,603
...and the food is good,
and guys like me are serving drinks.

277
00:19:08,853 --> 00:19:13,324
Maybe I can't explain all this,
but I can fix your dollhouse.

278
00:19:13,893 --> 00:19:16,771
At least I'm good at monkey work.

279
00:19:17,133 --> 00:19:20,489
You know, monkey?
You know what I mean?

280
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:25,084
I can hold these nails in place
with my tail.

281
00:19:28,933 --> 00:19:31,891
-You're so silly.
-Give me a banana.

282
00:19:32,093 --> 00:19:35,722
-I don't have any.
-You're holding out on me.

283
00:19:39,733 --> 00:19:44,170
-I'm sorry I called you a baboon.
-Think nothing of it.

284
00:19:44,413 --> 00:19:48,725
President Prince, President Princess,
President Priss....

285
00:19:50,253 --> 00:19:52,209
Hey, what's the matter, son?

286
00:19:52,413 --> 00:19:57,282
Oh, Dad. If just me, Milhouse
and Lewis had voted.

287
00:19:57,533 --> 00:20:02,049
Would you have gotten any
money for being class president?

288
00:20:02,253 --> 00:20:04,130
-No.
-Would you have more work?

289
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:05,322
Yeah.

290
00:20:05,533 --> 00:20:08,127
Is Martin gonna get to
do anything neat...

291
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:11,126
...like play in the World Series?

292
00:20:11,373 --> 00:20:14,126
-No.
-So, let the baby have his bottle.

293
00:20:14,373 --> 00:20:16,762
That's my motto.

294
00:20:18,693 --> 00:20:20,888
Hey, thanks, monkey-man.

295
00:20:22,653 --> 00:20:25,963
Holy moly, talk about parenting.

296
00:20:31,933 --> 00:20:35,812
Sleep well, Maggie.
Three for three.

297
00:20:37,493 --> 00:20:41,884
-Did you straighten everything--?
-Don't say anything, Marge.

298
00:20:42,133 --> 00:20:46,923
Let's just go to bed.
I'm on the biggest roll of my life.
