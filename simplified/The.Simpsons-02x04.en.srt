1
00:00:05,013 --> 00:00:06,162
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:06,373 --> 00:00:11,891
You know, Halloween is a strange
holiday. I don't understand it.

3
00:00:12,133 --> 00:00:15,443
Kids worshiping ghosts,
pretending to be devils...

4
00:00:15,693 --> 00:00:19,572
...things on TV that are
inappropriate for children.

5
00:00:19,893 --> 00:00:23,806
Things like the next half-hour.
Nothing bothers my kids.

6
00:00:24,053 --> 00:00:28,683
But tonight's show, which I wash
my hands of, is really scary.

7
00:00:28,933 --> 00:00:33,085
If you have sensitive kids, maybe
you should tuck them into bed...

8
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,893
...instead of writing
us angry letters.

9
00:00:36,133 --> 00:00:38,363
Thanks for your attention.

10
00:00:43,813 --> 00:00:45,565
Tree House of Horror

11
00:01:07,253 --> 00:01:10,563
What a haul this year.
I love Halloween.

12
00:01:12,173 --> 00:01:15,609
Wait a minute.
Let's see what the kids are up to.

13
00:01:16,093 --> 00:01:18,402
And the policeman
on the phone said:

14
00:01:18,653 --> 00:01:23,966
"We traced the call. It's coming
from the floor below you! Get out!"

15
00:01:24,213 --> 00:01:27,250
But it was too late. End of story.

16
00:01:27,493 --> 00:01:30,485
I heard that in the third grade.
It's not scary.

17
00:01:30,733 --> 00:01:32,007
-Is too.
-Is not.

18
00:01:32,213 --> 00:01:33,407
-Is too.
-Is not.

19
00:01:33,613 --> 00:01:37,970
-Fine! Then you tell one scarier.
-Flashlight, please.

20
00:01:38,573 --> 00:01:43,283
-Here's a story that's scarifying.
-Oh, brother.

21
00:01:43,533 --> 00:01:47,765
I call it, "Bad Dream House."

22
00:01:53,853 --> 00:01:56,572
-That's all. Sign here.
-There you are.

23
00:01:56,773 --> 00:01:59,970
-And a dollar for you.
-A buck.

24
00:02:00,173 --> 00:02:02,767
-I'm glad there's a curse here.
-Huh?

25
00:02:02,973 --> 00:02:04,770
Well, it's all ours!

26
00:02:04,973 --> 00:02:08,648
-I can't believe how cheap it was.
-Motivated seller.

27
00:02:08,893 --> 00:02:11,168
Well, he must have been motivated.

28
00:02:11,373 --> 00:02:15,810
Prime location, 18 rooms, moat.
We shouldn't be able to afford this.

29
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:19,045
So we got a deal for once.
Quit fighting it.

30
00:02:19,293 --> 00:02:22,046
It just seems too good to be true.

31
00:02:22,293 --> 00:02:24,488
Mom! Bart threw a book at me.

32
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,969
-Did not!
-Did too!

33
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:29,886
Get out.

34
00:02:30,133 --> 00:02:33,762
-What on earth was that?
-Oh, just the house settling.

35
00:02:39,053 --> 00:02:42,682
This kitchen certainly could
use a woman's touch.

36
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:47,683
-Homer! What's this in the corner?
-I don't know.

37
00:02:48,053 --> 00:02:51,841
Looks like a vortex.
A gateway into another dimension.

38
00:02:52,173 --> 00:02:55,165
Ooh, a vortex. Catch!

39
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:01,208
Hey, pretty slick.

40
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:07,972
"Quit throwing garbage
into our dimension."

41
00:03:08,213 --> 00:03:10,773
Mom! Dad! Help!

42
00:03:13,253 --> 00:03:15,562
Get out!

43
00:03:15,813 --> 00:03:19,601
Okay, boy, let's see you
talk yourself out of this one.

44
00:03:19,973 --> 00:03:22,407
I can feel an evil presence in here.

45
00:03:22,653 --> 00:03:25,372
-Evil?
-Quiet. You're scaring your mother.

46
00:03:25,573 --> 00:03:28,883
Children, get your coats.
We're leaving right now.

47
00:03:29,133 --> 00:03:34,002
Wait. It's only natural there would be
things wrong with a home like this.

48
00:03:34,253 --> 00:03:37,563
It's a fixer-upper.
What's the problem?

49
00:03:37,773 --> 00:03:39,206
We get some priests--

50
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:43,048
I won't live in this evil house
just to save money.

51
00:03:43,453 --> 00:03:44,886
Don't be so stubborn!

52
00:03:45,133 --> 00:03:51,049
We're not talking about a few dollars.
We're talking a few thousand dollars!

53
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:55,372
It's got great high ceilings!

54
00:03:58,013 --> 00:04:02,006
Tell you what.
Let's sleep on it. Okay?

55
00:04:02,373 --> 00:04:05,843
-All right. If anything happens--
-What could happen?

56
00:04:11,253 --> 00:04:14,404
They are all against you, Bart.

57
00:04:14,733 --> 00:04:19,807
You must kill them all.
They all must die.

58
00:04:20,053 --> 00:04:22,965
-Are you my conscience?
-I'm--

59
00:04:23,173 --> 00:04:25,482
Yes, I am.

60
00:04:25,693 --> 00:04:29,402
Lisa. Lisa.

61
00:04:29,653 --> 00:04:33,168
The butcher knife, Lisa.

62
00:04:37,853 --> 00:04:40,765
They are all against me.

63
00:04:40,973 --> 00:04:43,931
They all must die.

64
00:04:50,453 --> 00:04:53,968
Marge. Oh, Marge.

65
00:04:54,213 --> 00:04:57,762
I'm in the kitchen, Homer.

66
00:05:06,413 --> 00:05:10,201
Die! Die! Everybody die!

67
00:05:17,133 --> 00:05:18,805
What's going on out here?

68
00:05:19,053 --> 00:05:22,489
-Homer! Bart! Lisa! Maggie! Stop it!
-Sorry, Dad.

69
00:05:22,733 --> 00:05:24,564
-Sorry, Bart.
-Sorry, Mom.

70
00:05:25,053 --> 00:05:26,281
We're leaving.

71
00:05:26,533 --> 00:05:29,570
-You said you'd sleep on it.
-I don't care.

72
00:05:29,773 --> 00:05:32,162
This family has had
its differences...

73
00:05:32,413 --> 00:05:36,088
...but we've never had knife fights.
I blame this house.

74
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:38,767
Mom! Dad! Look!

75
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:45,003
-It's an ancient Indian burial ground.
-Man, this place has everything!

76
00:05:45,253 --> 00:05:47,562
An ancient Indian what?

77
00:05:50,773 --> 00:05:53,207
Mr. Plott? Homer Simpson here.

78
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:57,241
When you sold me the house
you didn't mention one thing.

79
00:05:57,493 --> 00:06:02,487
You didn't tell me it was built
on an Indian burial ground!

80
00:06:02,733 --> 00:06:05,566
No, you didn't!

81
00:06:05,813 --> 00:06:08,008
That's not my recollection!

82
00:06:08,253 --> 00:06:11,609
Yeah? Well, all right. Goodbye.

83
00:06:12,373 --> 00:06:15,171
-He says he mentioned it.
-Let's go, kids.

84
00:06:15,413 --> 00:06:16,562
-Ah, Marge.
-Homer!

85
00:06:16,973 --> 00:06:19,282
You will die.

86
00:06:19,533 --> 00:06:21,171
You will die slowly.

87
00:06:21,573 --> 00:06:26,966
Your stomach will swell.
Your intestines will writhe and boil.

88
00:06:27,213 --> 00:06:30,922
Your eyes will burst
and some horrible stuff...

89
00:06:31,173 --> 00:06:36,372
...possibly your brains, will start
coming out through your nose.

90
00:06:36,613 --> 00:06:40,401
Shush! Shut up!
Quit trying to push us around!

91
00:06:40,893 --> 00:06:45,762
Stop saying those horrible
things and show some manners!

92
00:06:49,973 --> 00:06:53,409
Look. I've never been so angry.
My hands are shaking.

93
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:55,729
Better than your eyes bursting.

94
00:06:55,933 --> 00:06:57,412
-Do it again.
-What?

95
00:06:57,613 --> 00:06:59,410
-Make the walls bleed.
-No.

96
00:06:59,613 --> 00:07:01,683
We own you.
Let's see some blood.

97
00:07:01,933 --> 00:07:05,812
-I don't have to entertain you.
-Do it! Do the blood thing.

98
00:07:06,053 --> 00:07:08,123
Come on! Do it! Do it! Do it!

99
00:07:08,373 --> 00:07:11,809
Why are you scaring us?
To keep us from getting close...

100
00:07:12,013 --> 00:07:14,925
-...and maybe even loving you?
-Leave me alone.

101
00:07:15,133 --> 00:07:16,407
Don't talk that way.

102
00:07:16,653 --> 00:07:19,372
-Hey, listen, lady--
-Oh, don't call me lady.

103
00:07:19,573 --> 00:07:23,691
My name is Marge Simpson,
and we're not going anywhere.

104
00:07:23,893 --> 00:07:29,092
We're going to have to live together,
so you better get used to it. Please.

105
00:07:30,053 --> 00:07:33,762
-Can I think about this?
-Sure.

106
00:07:38,933 --> 00:07:41,163
Life with the Simpsons.

107
00:07:41,453 --> 00:07:43,364
What choice do I have?

108
00:07:49,733 --> 00:07:50,802
-Wow!
-Bitchen!

109
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:54,204
It destroyed itself
rather than live with us.

110
00:07:54,573 --> 00:07:57,326
You can't help but feel
a little rejected.

111
00:08:02,053 --> 00:08:04,283
-That wasn't scary.
-Oh, yeah?

112
00:08:04,533 --> 00:08:08,162
Well, how about this severed finger!

113
00:08:10,813 --> 00:08:12,644
Eww! Baby spit!

114
00:08:13,133 --> 00:08:18,082
Well, that last story was a warmup
for this macabre tale I call:

115
00:08:20,253 --> 00:08:22,562
"Hungry Are the Damned. "

116
00:08:24,813 --> 00:08:27,486
-Homer, all these flies.
-Not to worry.

117
00:08:27,733 --> 00:08:30,566
I'll just turn on the trusty
bug zapper.

118
00:08:32,933 --> 00:08:35,322
Ooh! That was a big mama.

119
00:08:50,253 --> 00:08:51,686
That should do it.

120
00:08:51,933 --> 00:08:56,961
Man alive, there's nothing better
than a hamburger grilled to perfection.

121
00:08:58,053 --> 00:08:59,725
Cool, man!

122
00:09:12,613 --> 00:09:16,572
The burgers are getting
cold, guys-- Holy moly.

123
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:27,168
Huh?

124
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:54,769
Greetings, Earthlings.
I am Kang. Do not be frightened.

125
00:09:54,973 --> 00:09:57,168
We mean you no harm.

126
00:09:57,413 --> 00:10:00,564
-You speak English.
-I'm speaking Rigelian.

127
00:10:00,773 --> 00:10:04,402
By coincidence, our languages
are exactly the same.

128
00:10:04,653 --> 00:10:08,885
-What are you gonna do with us?
-We're taking you to Rigel Four.

129
00:10:09,133 --> 00:10:12,682
A world of infinite delights
to tantalize your senses...

130
00:10:12,973 --> 00:10:15,282
...and challenge your intellect.

131
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:19,367
Look. To you, we Simpsons
are a lower order of life.

132
00:10:19,613 --> 00:10:24,084
We face that prejudice every day,
but we are happy on our planet.

133
00:10:24,413 --> 00:10:27,405
We throw ourselves on your mercy.
Please return--

134
00:10:27,653 --> 00:10:29,928
-Dinner!
-Get a load of that spread.

135
00:10:30,173 --> 00:10:33,802
Here you go. Take all you
want, but eat all you take.

136
00:10:34,053 --> 00:10:35,532
Thank you, Mr--?

137
00:10:35,773 --> 00:10:40,608
To pronounce it correctly,
I would have to pull out your tongue.

138
00:10:43,813 --> 00:10:45,883
-Fried shrimp.
-Sloppy joes.

139
00:10:46,133 --> 00:10:49,330
-Smothered pork chops.
-Look! Radish rosettes.

140
00:10:49,533 --> 00:10:52,764
These are hard to make.
They're an advanced race.

141
00:10:52,973 --> 00:10:56,966
Come, Earthlings, eat.
Grow large with food.

142
00:11:00,173 --> 00:11:02,164
Something's not quite right.

143
00:11:02,373 --> 00:11:06,969
The girl's right. Let's get some
applesauce for these pork chops!

144
00:11:08,013 --> 00:11:11,892
-What are you looking at, buddy?
-Your wife's quite a dish.

145
00:11:12,133 --> 00:11:14,169
Thanks.

146
00:11:15,253 --> 00:11:21,089
It's our pleasure to provide you
with entertainment on your journey.

147
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:25,849
We get over a million channels
from the far reaches of the galaxy.

148
00:11:26,093 --> 00:11:28,323
-Do you get HBO?
-No. That's extra.

149
00:11:28,533 --> 00:11:31,570
Here's our achievement
in amusement technology.

150
00:11:31,813 --> 00:11:34,611
An electronic version of table tennis.

151
00:11:34,853 --> 00:11:38,163
-Your paddles have been replaced--
-That's just Pong!

152
00:11:38,413 --> 00:11:42,406
-Get with the times, man.
-We played that before marriage.

153
00:11:42,653 --> 00:11:44,609
We did build this spaceship.

154
00:11:44,853 --> 00:11:49,608
Anyone that has mastered
intergalactic travel, raise your hand.

155
00:11:54,693 --> 00:11:59,767
-All right, then.
-Sorry. Your game is very nice.

156
00:12:01,853 --> 00:12:05,004
-Dinnertime.
-How come you guys never eat?

157
00:12:05,253 --> 00:12:09,963
Oh, we wouldn't want to
spoil our appetite for...

158
00:12:10,173 --> 00:12:13,006
...the feast when we
land on Rigel Four.

159
00:12:13,253 --> 00:12:15,767
-Ooh, a feast.
-Will we be invited?

160
00:12:15,973 --> 00:12:18,407
Oh, you'll be at the feast.

161
00:12:18,653 --> 00:12:22,771
I have a feeling you'll
be the guests of honor.

162
00:12:24,453 --> 00:12:27,411
-Tell us more about this feast.
-No, eat now.

163
00:12:27,653 --> 00:12:33,649
When we arrive, there will be
plenty of time to chew the fat.

164
00:12:40,053 --> 00:12:42,362
Very good, Earth boy.

165
00:12:46,853 --> 00:12:50,209
Excellent, Mr. Simpson. Excellent.

166
00:13:00,573 --> 00:13:04,532
This will give the humans
the perfect flavor.

167
00:13:17,053 --> 00:13:19,567
Stop! Don't you see what's happening?

168
00:13:19,813 --> 00:13:22,532
They're fattening us up
so they can eat us!

169
00:13:22,733 --> 00:13:24,325
-Lisa.
-Oh, come on, Lisa.

170
00:13:24,533 --> 00:13:27,889
If you don't believe me,
look at this book I found.

171
00:13:29,293 --> 00:13:32,205
-She's right.
-You have stopped eating.

172
00:13:32,453 --> 00:13:35,013
Listen, you big stupid space creature!

173
00:13:35,253 --> 00:13:38,802
Nobody, but nobody,
eats the Simpsons.

174
00:13:39,053 --> 00:13:42,204
-I beg your pardon?
-We found your book.

175
00:13:42,453 --> 00:13:43,806
You mean this?

176
00:13:44,053 --> 00:13:47,966
It's a harmless cookbook.
It's just a little dusty.

177
00:13:53,853 --> 00:13:55,571
Wait a minute.

178
00:14:00,133 --> 00:14:03,808
Wait, there's still more
space dust on here.

179
00:14:06,813 --> 00:14:10,772
-Let me get this straight.
-They thought we would eat them.

180
00:14:11,013 --> 00:14:15,564
-Good God! Is this some kind of joke?
-No, they're serious.

181
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:18,008
Why were you making us eat?

182
00:14:18,253 --> 00:14:21,404
Make you eat?
We merely provided a banquet...

183
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:24,008
...and you made pigs of yourselves.

184
00:14:24,253 --> 00:14:29,122
I slaved in the kitchen
for days for you people and--

185
00:14:29,693 --> 00:14:33,766
Well, if you wanted to make Serak cry,
mission accomplished.

186
00:14:34,013 --> 00:14:38,450
You aren't the only beings
who have emotions, you know.

187
00:14:44,853 --> 00:14:46,809
We offered you paradise.

188
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:51,724
You would have experienced emotions
greater than what you call love...

189
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:54,288
...greater than what you call fun.

190
00:14:54,533 --> 00:14:59,084
You would have been treated like
gods and lived forever in beauty.

191
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:04,282
But, now, because of your
distrustful nature, that can never be.

192
00:15:04,533 --> 00:15:07,969
For a superior race,
they really rub it in.

193
00:15:11,133 --> 00:15:14,762
There were monsters on that
ship, and we were them.

194
00:15:14,973 --> 00:15:18,283
See why we say you're
too smart for your own good?

195
00:15:18,533 --> 00:15:21,570
-Way to go, Lis.
-Yeah, thanks, Lisa.

196
00:15:26,933 --> 00:15:29,970
Hello, something scary happening.

197
00:15:33,253 --> 00:15:36,290
Hey, it's Halloween.
Put the book away.

198
00:15:36,533 --> 00:15:42,051
For your information, I'm about to
read a tale by Edgar Allan Poe.

199
00:15:42,293 --> 00:15:47,003
-Wait. That's a schoolbook.
-Don't worry, you won't learn anything.

200
00:15:47,253 --> 00:15:50,006
It's called, The Raven.

201
00:15:50,253 --> 00:15:52,608
Once upon a midnight dreary

202
00:15:52,853 --> 00:15:55,686
While I pondered
Weak and weary

203
00:15:55,933 --> 00:15:59,767
Over many a quaint and curious
Volume of forgotten lore

204
00:15:59,973 --> 00:16:03,966
I nodded, nearly napping
Suddenly there came a tapping

205
00:16:04,173 --> 00:16:07,483
As of someone gently rapping
At my chamber door

206
00:16:07,773 --> 00:16:09,604
-Just some visitor--
-I muttered

207
00:16:09,853 --> 00:16:12,686
Tapping at my chamber door

208
00:16:12,933 --> 00:16:14,889
Only this and nothing more

209
00:16:15,133 --> 00:16:19,206
-Are we scared yet?
-Bart, he's establishing mood.

210
00:16:19,453 --> 00:16:23,492
Ah, distinctly I remember
It is in the bleak December

211
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:26,964
Each dying ember wrought
Its ghost on the floor

212
00:16:27,213 --> 00:16:29,010
Eagerly I wished
The morrow

213
00:16:29,253 --> 00:16:33,963
Vainly I had sought to borrow
From my books surcease of sorrow

214
00:16:35,213 --> 00:16:37,169
Sorrow for the lost Lenore

215
00:16:37,373 --> 00:16:38,806
Oh, Lenore.

216
00:16:39,053 --> 00:16:42,887
For the rare and radiant maiden
Whom angels name Lenore

217
00:16:43,133 --> 00:16:45,249
Nameless here
For evermore

218
00:16:47,533 --> 00:16:52,049
The silken sad uncertain rustling
Of each curtain thrilled me

219
00:16:52,293 --> 00:16:55,763
Filled me with fantastic terrors
Never felt before

220
00:16:56,013 --> 00:16:58,607
To still my beating heart
I stood repeating

221
00:16:58,853 --> 00:17:02,004
A visitor at my chamber door
And nothing more

222
00:17:02,253 --> 00:17:05,768
My soul grew stronger
Hesitating then no longer

223
00:17:06,013 --> 00:17:07,412
-Sir--
-Said I

224
00:17:07,653 --> 00:17:11,407
Or Madam, truly your
Forgiveness I implore

225
00:17:11,653 --> 00:17:16,773
I was napping, and you came rapping
And so faintly you came tapping

226
00:17:16,973 --> 00:17:20,170
Tapping at my chamber door
That I scarce was sure I heard you

227
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:22,364
Here I opened
Wide the door

228
00:17:22,613 --> 00:17:24,729
This better be good.

229
00:17:25,373 --> 00:17:28,570
Darkness there and nothing more

230
00:17:29,133 --> 00:17:30,771
You know what's scarier?

231
00:17:31,013 --> 00:17:32,412
-What?
-Anything!

232
00:17:32,973 --> 00:17:36,363
Back into the chamber turning
My soul within me burning

233
00:17:36,573 --> 00:17:40,361
Soon again I heard tapping
Something louder than before

234
00:17:41,453 --> 00:17:42,488
-Surely--
-Said I

235
00:17:42,733 --> 00:17:44,803
Something at
My window lattice

236
00:17:45,053 --> 00:17:48,284
Let me see what thereat is
And this mystery explore

237
00:17:48,533 --> 00:17:51,570
I flung a shutter
With a flirt and flutter

238
00:17:51,813 --> 00:17:54,566
In stepped a Raven
Of the days of yore

239
00:17:54,813 --> 00:17:57,771
No obeisance made he
Not a minute stayed he

240
00:17:57,973 --> 00:18:01,090
Mien of lord or lady
Perched above my door

241
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:04,211
Perched upon a bust
Just above my door

242
00:18:04,453 --> 00:18:07,365
Perched and sat
And nothing more

243
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:10,972
-Thy crest be shorn and shaven--
-I said

244
00:18:11,213 --> 00:18:17,004
Art sure no craven, ghastly ancient
Raven wandering from the nightly shore

245
00:18:17,253 --> 00:18:22,930
-Tell me what thy name is--
-Quoth the Raven

246
00:18:23,173 --> 00:18:26,006
-Eat my shorts!
-He says, "Nevermore."

247
00:18:26,253 --> 00:18:29,643
-And that's all he'll ever say.
-Okay. Okay.

248
00:18:33,453 --> 00:18:35,967
Then methought
The air grew denser

249
00:18:36,213 --> 00:18:39,489
-Perfumed by some unseen censer
-Stupid censer.

250
00:18:39,733 --> 00:18:43,203
Swung by Seraphim
Whose foot tinkled on the floor

251
00:18:43,453 --> 00:18:44,488
-Wretch--
-I cried

252
00:18:44,733 --> 00:18:46,963
God lent thee
By angels sent thee

253
00:18:47,213 --> 00:18:49,966
Respite from thy
Memories of Lenore

254
00:18:50,173 --> 00:18:55,327
Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe
And forget this lost Lenore

255
00:18:55,573 --> 00:18:57,211
-Quoth the Raven--
-Nevermore

256
00:18:57,453 --> 00:19:02,288
-Be that word our sign of parting--
-I shrieked up starting

257
00:19:02,533 --> 00:19:06,572
Get thee into the tempest
And the night's Plutonian shore

258
00:19:06,773 --> 00:19:11,289
Leave no black plume as a token
Of the lie thy soul hath spoken

259
00:19:11,533 --> 00:19:15,572
Leave my loneliness unbroken
Quit the bust above my door

260
00:19:15,933 --> 00:19:21,371
Take thy beak from out my heart
And take thy form from off my door

261
00:19:21,613 --> 00:19:23,649
-Quoth the Raven--
-Nevermore

262
00:19:24,053 --> 00:19:28,763
Take thy beak from out my heart
And take thy form from off my door

263
00:19:29,013 --> 00:19:30,082
Quoth the Raven

264
00:19:30,293 --> 00:19:32,284
-Nevermore
-Why you little--

265
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:37,563
Come back here, you little raven!

266
00:19:47,893 --> 00:19:51,772
Nevermore, nevermore
Nevermore

267
00:20:01,173 --> 00:20:05,405
The Raven never flitting
Still is sitting, still is sitting

268
00:20:05,653 --> 00:20:08,804
On the pallid bust
Just above my chamber door

269
00:20:09,053 --> 00:20:12,489
His eyes have the seeming
Of a demon that is dreaming

270
00:20:12,733 --> 00:20:16,203
The lamplight o'er him streaming
Throws his shadow on the floor

271
00:20:16,453 --> 00:20:20,765
My soul from out that shadow
That lies floating on the floor

272
00:20:20,973 --> 00:20:24,363
Shall be lifted
Nevermore

273
00:20:27,053 --> 00:20:30,170
Lisa, that wasn't scary.
Not even for a poem.

274
00:20:30,413 --> 00:20:34,372
It was written in 1845.
Maybe people were easier to scare.

275
00:20:34,613 --> 00:20:39,482
Like Friday the 13th Part I.
It's pretty tame by today's standards.

276
00:20:39,733 --> 00:20:41,963
Children, bedtime!

277
00:20:42,173 --> 00:20:45,961
I guess I'll have no trouble
getting to sleep tonight.

278
00:21:02,373 --> 00:21:04,728
Oh, no, Marge. Come on, please.

279
00:21:04,973 --> 00:21:07,692
I'm not sleeping with the lights on.

280
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:11,482
They're just children's stories.
They can't hurt you.

281
00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:22,282
Oh, I hate Halloween!
