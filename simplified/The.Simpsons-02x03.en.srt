1
00:00:05,693 --> 00:00:07,251
Bart Gets An F

2
00:01:19,253 --> 00:01:22,928
Bart, no more interruptions
during Martin's book report.

3
00:01:23,173 --> 00:01:27,451
Never have I seen a more
noble thing than you, brother.

4
00:01:30,493 --> 00:01:33,405
I do not care who kills who.

5
00:01:33,653 --> 00:01:39,364
To catch a fish, to kill a bull,
to make love to a woman.

6
00:01:39,613 --> 00:01:43,083
To live. I thank you.

7
00:01:43,293 --> 00:01:45,648
Oh, absolutely brilliant!

8
00:01:45,973 --> 00:01:50,046
I truly believed you were Hemingway.
Bravo, Martin.

9
00:01:50,253 --> 00:01:54,326
-Call me Papa.
-Some ketchup for your buns, Papa?

10
00:01:54,533 --> 00:01:58,412
We have time for one more report.
Bart Simpson?

11
00:01:58,613 --> 00:02:00,968
Is your book report ready?

12
00:02:01,173 --> 00:02:06,452
Is it ready? What a question!
Students, prepare to be dazzled.

13
00:02:06,653 --> 00:02:12,091
The name of the book that
I read was Treasure Island.

14
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,483
It's about these pirates...

15
00:02:14,853 --> 00:02:19,290
...with patches over their eyes
and shiny gold teeth.

16
00:02:19,613 --> 00:02:23,401
And green birds on their shoulders.

17
00:02:23,853 --> 00:02:28,085
Did I mention it was written
by Robert Louis Stevenson?

18
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:30,688
And published by McGraw-Hill.

19
00:02:30,933 --> 00:02:34,448
So in conclusion,
on a scale of 1 to 10...

20
00:02:34,693 --> 00:02:39,005
...10 being the highest, 1 the lowest,
and 5 average, I give it...

21
00:02:39,213 --> 00:02:41,204
...a 9.

22
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:44,206
Questions? No?
Then I'll sit down.

23
00:02:44,453 --> 00:02:45,932
Did you read the book?

24
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:50,126
I'm insulted.
Is this a book report or a witch hunt?

25
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:54,246
Then perhaps you'll tell us
the name of the pirate.

26
00:02:54,453 --> 00:02:57,923
Blackbeard, Captain Nemo,
Captain Hook, Bluebeard.

27
00:02:58,173 --> 00:03:01,882
-Bluebeard?
-Sit down. I'll see you after class.

28
00:03:03,013 --> 00:03:05,447
Your grades have gotten worse.

29
00:03:05,653 --> 00:03:07,644
-Did you know that?
-Yes, ma'am.

30
00:03:07,853 --> 00:03:11,528
-Did you know there's a test tomorrow?
-Yes, ma'am.

31
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:14,645
-Blah, blah, blah, blah.
-Yes, ma'am.

32
00:03:14,853 --> 00:03:17,686
-Blah, blah, blah.
-Yes, ma'am.

33
00:03:17,893 --> 00:03:21,010
-You haven't been paying attention!
-Yes, ma'am.

34
00:03:21,213 --> 00:03:23,329
Then what did I say?

35
00:03:23,573 --> 00:03:26,690
-Straighten up and fly right?
-Lucky guess.

36
00:03:29,573 --> 00:03:31,450
Take that, granny!

37
00:03:31,693 --> 00:03:35,368
Hide! Deadly mothballs.
Granny's kissing me!

38
00:03:35,573 --> 00:03:41,489
You reached the level of ungrateful
grandchild. Try again, if you dare!

39
00:03:44,053 --> 00:03:47,204
A couple more games
and I'll hit the books.

40
00:04:02,293 --> 00:04:05,649
Soup's on!
Hurry up, or it'll get that skin.

41
00:04:05,853 --> 00:04:07,571
I hate that icky soup skin.

42
00:04:07,773 --> 00:04:10,526
After dinner,
it's down to business.

43
00:04:11,453 --> 00:04:15,412
-Marge, get me another beer.
-Wait, Lisa has some news.

44
00:04:15,653 --> 00:04:20,727
-He doesn't care, Mom.
-I do. I want a beer while I'm caring.

45
00:04:20,933 --> 00:04:22,924
Homer! Go ahead, Lisa.

46
00:04:23,133 --> 00:04:26,125
I got an A on my vocabulary test.

47
00:04:26,573 --> 00:04:32,364
You did! Well, that's just....
Oh, what a glorious day!

48
00:04:32,573 --> 00:04:36,566
Hand me your paper.
I'll put it on the refrigerator.

49
00:04:36,893 --> 00:04:40,727
I might as well kill
two birds with one stone.

50
00:04:40,933 --> 00:04:42,525
You covered up my paper!

51
00:04:42,733 --> 00:04:46,203
Look at those funny little whiskers.
That reminds me.

52
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:48,967
It's Gorilla Week
on Million Dollar Movie.

53
00:04:49,173 --> 00:04:51,403
No, Dad, I should really--

54
00:04:51,893 --> 00:04:57,604
Gorilla the Conqueror.
The granddaddy of them all.

55
00:04:58,933 --> 00:05:01,891
Well, maybe just one more hour.

56
00:05:04,653 --> 00:05:08,123
It's so unfair.
Just because he's different.

57
00:05:08,373 --> 00:05:10,648
Time to hit the books.

58
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:13,453
Burning the candle
at both ends, boy?

59
00:05:14,093 --> 00:05:17,642
All right, let's take care
of some business.

60
00:05:17,893 --> 00:05:20,202
"Chapter One: A Dream of Freedom.

61
00:05:20,413 --> 00:05:25,851
On September 15, 1620, separatists
from the Church of England...

62
00:05:26,053 --> 00:05:30,808
...some living in Holland,
left Plymouth, England.

63
00:05:32,213 --> 00:05:35,728
Their destination was...."

64
00:05:37,213 --> 00:05:41,047
Marge, come take a look at this.

65
00:05:41,293 --> 00:05:45,252
The little tiger tries so hard.
Why does he keep failing?

66
00:05:45,493 --> 00:05:48,610
Just a little dim, I guess.

67
00:05:50,093 --> 00:05:53,608
Bart, you're gonna miss your bus.

68
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:56,492
Hey, Bart-dude.
You look freaked.

69
00:05:56,693 --> 00:06:00,652
I got a test I'm not ready for.
Can you crash the bus?

70
00:06:00,853 --> 00:06:05,529
Sorry, I can't do it on purpose.
But maybe you'll get lucky.

71
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:10,602
Okay, don't panic. Find an egghead
and pump him for some answers.

72
00:06:14,293 --> 00:06:16,648
I bet he didn't study again.

73
00:06:16,893 --> 00:06:21,364
-Now he'll try to get answers from us.
-He's pathetic.

74
00:06:21,573 --> 00:06:24,087
-Morning, girls.
-Good morning, Bart.

75
00:06:24,293 --> 00:06:28,206
Who's up for a cram session?
I'll go first.

76
00:06:28,413 --> 00:06:32,452
-Name the pilgrim's boat.
-The Spirit of St. Louis.

77
00:06:32,653 --> 00:06:35,008
-Where'd they land?
-Sunny Acapulco.

78
00:06:35,213 --> 00:06:38,285
-Why'd they leave England?
-Giant rats.

79
00:06:38,493 --> 00:06:41,405
Cool, history's coming alive.

80
00:06:44,253 --> 00:06:47,051
I don't know why I should care...

81
00:06:47,293 --> 00:06:51,809
...but the information that
you just received is erroneous.

82
00:06:52,013 --> 00:06:53,207
You're saying--

83
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:58,851
A blindfolded chimp with a pencil in
his teeth has more chances than you.

84
00:06:59,053 --> 00:07:01,806
Thanks for the pep talk.

85
00:07:02,253 --> 00:07:05,802
All right, take one
and pass the rest back.

86
00:07:06,013 --> 00:07:09,369
Think, Simpson!
Crisis brings out the best in you.

87
00:07:11,893 --> 00:07:18,446
-What is it, Bart?
-Nothing. Must. Take. Test.

88
00:07:29,413 --> 00:07:33,691
-What's the matter, son?
-Stabbing pains in my stomach.

89
00:07:33,893 --> 00:07:35,929
Oh, dear, I've heard of this.

90
00:07:36,173 --> 00:07:39,449
-Do you feel pain in your arm?
-Both arms.

91
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:44,608
-Temporary loss of vision?
-Who said that? Come closer.

92
00:07:47,053 --> 00:07:48,566
Yes, dear?

93
00:07:48,773 --> 00:07:53,005
Maybe one more dish.
Make it cappuccino chocolate fudge.

94
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:56,531
Your third bowl.
I think you're on the mend.

95
00:07:56,773 --> 00:07:59,241
Anything else I can get you?

96
00:07:59,453 --> 00:08:02,445
-Perhaps the TV?
-Of course. Homer!

97
00:08:02,693 --> 00:08:03,682
What?

98
00:08:03,933 --> 00:08:07,562
Bring the TV up.
Bart's got his vision back!

99
00:08:08,413 --> 00:08:11,246
I wish I had amoria phlebitis.

100
00:08:11,653 --> 00:08:15,009
-I know you're faking it.
-Keep your mouth shut.

101
00:08:15,213 --> 00:08:20,412
-You'll still fail that test.
-I've got my bases covered.

102
00:08:20,773 --> 00:08:22,684
Milhouse, what'd I miss today?

103
00:08:22,893 --> 00:08:25,532
Richard laughed milk through his nose.

104
00:08:25,733 --> 00:08:29,408
What about that history test?
Piece of cake?

105
00:08:29,613 --> 00:08:32,411
What'd you get for number one?

106
00:08:32,933 --> 00:08:35,925
Number two?
Yeah, that sounds right.

107
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:43,045
Here you go, Mrs. Krabappel.
You'll be pleasantly surprised.

108
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:49,642
This test is worse than Milhouse's!

109
00:08:49,893 --> 00:08:53,932
Bart, I warned you.
This is the final straw!

110
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:58,809
You know our district psychiatrist,
Dr. J. Loren Pryor.

111
00:08:59,053 --> 00:09:00,452
Hey, Dr. J.

112
00:09:00,613 --> 00:09:06,245
This is a classic case of what
laymen refer to as "fear of failure."

113
00:09:06,493 --> 00:09:10,930
Bart is an underachiever,
yet he seems to be....

114
00:09:11,173 --> 00:09:14,245
How should I put this?
Proud of it.

115
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:18,405
One of his problems
is a short attention span.

116
00:09:18,653 --> 00:09:20,564
Blah, blah, blah.

117
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:30,642
Bart failed his last four exams.
Is there anything you haven't told us?

118
00:09:30,893 --> 00:09:34,488
Everyone else in the class
has shown some improvement.

119
00:09:34,693 --> 00:09:37,890
-Yet you continue to struggle. Why?
-I don't know.

120
00:09:38,093 --> 00:09:43,611
Look at these results: 55, 42, 26.
A 12 on state capitals!

121
00:09:43,853 --> 00:09:46,970
Why are we dancing around the obvious?

122
00:09:47,173 --> 00:09:49,607
We all know it. I'm dumb as a post.

123
00:09:49,853 --> 00:09:53,402
-Think I'm happy?
-You're just a late bloomer.

124
00:09:53,653 --> 00:09:55,086
It isn't that simple.

125
00:09:55,333 --> 00:10:00,851
As emotionally crippling as it may be,
my recommendation is for Bart to...

126
00:10:01,093 --> 00:10:03,243
...repeat the fourth grade.

127
00:10:03,493 --> 00:10:07,008
-You can't! I'll do better!
-That'll be the day.

128
00:10:07,253 --> 00:10:12,327
Maybe it would help him to be
left back. It won't be so bad.

129
00:10:12,573 --> 00:10:15,645
You can't hold me back.
I swear I'll do better.

130
00:10:15,893 --> 00:10:19,408
Look in my eyes.
See the sincerity? See the fear?

131
00:10:19,613 --> 00:10:23,242
As God is my witness,
I can pass the fourth grade!

132
00:10:23,573 --> 00:10:27,964
If not, at least you'll be
bigger than the other kids.

133
00:10:29,373 --> 00:10:33,571
Get off the bus and forever
hold your peace, little dudes.

134
00:10:33,853 --> 00:10:39,246
Otto, I respect you. You let us throw
stuff at cars and try to tip the bus.

135
00:10:39,453 --> 00:10:43,731
Damn thing never goes over, does it?
So what's in your head?

136
00:10:44,093 --> 00:10:47,768
I've been failing
a lot of tests recently.

137
00:10:47,973 --> 00:10:51,488
They'll hold me back
if I don't shape up.

138
00:10:52,133 --> 00:10:57,002
That's it? Relax, man. It could
be the best thing to happen to you.

139
00:10:57,213 --> 00:11:00,842
I got held back in the fourth grade.
Twice.

140
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:06,247
And look at me, man.
Now I drive the school bus!

141
00:11:07,853 --> 00:11:13,052
My recommendation is for Bart
to repeat the fourth grade.

142
00:11:15,533 --> 00:11:19,003
All right, class,
the topic is world literature.

143
00:11:19,213 --> 00:11:24,162
What was the pirate's name in
Treasure Island, Bart Simpson?

144
00:11:24,373 --> 00:11:30,050
I got a peptic ulcer, my wife wants
a new car and I need a root canal.

145
00:11:30,293 --> 00:11:34,252
-Quit bugging me about the pirate.
-Long John Silver, Dad.

146
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:40,045
I heard that, Bart Jr.
I want to see both of you after class.

147
00:11:40,293 --> 00:11:42,443
Thanks a lot, son.

148
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:48,289
Yo, little help!

149
00:11:48,493 --> 00:11:52,042
I said little help.
Throw me the ball, Poindexter.

150
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:55,882
I'm sorry, Bart.
I don't know the rules of your sport.

151
00:11:56,093 --> 00:11:59,608
I didn't want to interfere
with a ball in play.

152
00:12:01,693 --> 00:12:04,526
Back to the forecastle of the Pequod.

153
00:12:05,613 --> 00:12:09,162
-Hey, Martin.
-I have nothing of value.

154
00:12:09,373 --> 00:12:11,250
Help me get a passing grade.

155
00:12:11,453 --> 00:12:17,210
You need someone's help, but I don't
know why that someone should be me.

156
00:12:17,453 --> 00:12:21,446
I can make it so the other kids
don't laugh at you.

157
00:12:21,693 --> 00:12:26,642
They laugh at me? I'd always
considered myself rather popular.

158
00:12:26,853 --> 00:12:29,162
You're not. Watch.

159
00:12:31,773 --> 00:12:36,642
My speed with numbers,
my years as a hall monitor...

160
00:12:36,853 --> 00:12:41,210
...my prize-winning dioramas,
they mean nothing to them?

161
00:12:41,413 --> 00:12:44,405
Perhaps another demonstration.

162
00:12:45,373 --> 00:12:49,207
-Very well, you've made your point.
-Then it's a deal?

163
00:12:49,373 --> 00:12:50,601
Yes.

164
00:12:50,813 --> 00:12:54,567
-Let's have a look at your study area.
-Study area?

165
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:57,924
Your sanctuary from
the frenzy of modern life.

166
00:12:58,253 --> 00:13:01,643
There's a desk under that junk.

167
00:13:01,853 --> 00:13:03,923
No, this won't do at all.

168
00:13:04,133 --> 00:13:07,682
We have to clean up this room.
And we'll need a fern.

169
00:13:07,933 --> 00:13:10,766
No room is complete
without plant life.

170
00:13:12,693 --> 00:13:17,528
No. Geeks sit in the front.
From now on, you sit in the back row.

171
00:13:17,733 --> 00:13:20,645
That goes for school and church too.

172
00:13:20,893 --> 00:13:24,806
-Why?
-So no one can see what you're doing.

173
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:26,605
I understand.

174
00:13:26,813 --> 00:13:31,125
Mischief varies inversely with
proximity to the authority figure.

175
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:33,972
Yeah, but don't say it like that.

176
00:14:10,973 --> 00:14:14,090
Soon you'll be ready to try it
with a real book.

177
00:14:17,693 --> 00:14:21,606
Pushing a boy into the girls' lavatory
was such a thrill!

178
00:14:21,853 --> 00:14:25,846
The screams, the humiliation,
the fact that it wasn't me!

179
00:14:26,053 --> 00:14:30,444
-I've never felt so alive.
-Now, the test is tomorrow--

180
00:14:30,693 --> 00:14:34,322
Who cares about some test?
Life's too short!

181
00:14:34,533 --> 00:14:37,047
I thought we had a deal.

182
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:42,242
The old Martin no longer exists.
Come on, fellows, to the arcade!

183
00:14:42,493 --> 00:14:44,449
Cool, Martin!

184
00:14:44,693 --> 00:14:47,571
Martin! Martin! Martin!

185
00:14:53,573 --> 00:14:58,442
-Bart, it's past your bedtime.
-Okay.

186
00:14:58,693 --> 00:15:00,923
This is hopeless.

187
00:15:03,573 --> 00:15:08,442
This is the end of the road.
I haven't always been a good kid.

188
00:15:08,693 --> 00:15:12,845
But if I go to school tomorrow,
I'll fail and be held back.

189
00:15:13,093 --> 00:15:17,052
I need one more day to study, Lord.
I need your help.

190
00:15:17,253 --> 00:15:19,608
Prayer, the last refuge
of a scoundrel.

191
00:15:19,853 --> 00:15:25,052
A teacher strike, a power failure.
Anything that'll cancel school.

192
00:15:25,293 --> 00:15:29,809
I know it's asking a lot,
but if anyone can do it, you can.

193
00:15:30,053 --> 00:15:33,966
Thanking you in advance,
your pal, Bart Simpson.

194
00:15:52,213 --> 00:15:56,604
Wake up, Bart.
Rise and shine, little guy.

195
00:15:56,813 --> 00:15:58,804
Oh, no.

196
00:15:59,053 --> 00:16:01,328
Wake up and look at the snow.

197
00:16:01,693 --> 00:16:04,924
Whoa! Good morning, world!

198
00:16:05,133 --> 00:16:08,125
It's the Bill and Marty Show.

199
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,051
-He's Bill.
-He's Marty.

200
00:16:10,293 --> 00:16:12,363
We can't get enough of each other.

201
00:16:12,573 --> 00:16:16,361
We've got snow-formation
for you flake lovers.

202
00:16:16,573 --> 00:16:19,292
The gas and water plants are closed.

203
00:16:19,493 --> 00:16:22,724
And the nuclear power plant.
That's closed too.

204
00:16:22,973 --> 00:16:24,645
All right!

205
00:16:24,853 --> 00:16:28,243
Now, for all you youngsters,
here it is.

206
00:16:28,453 --> 00:16:30,887
Springfield county schools are--

207
00:16:31,093 --> 00:16:32,811
Oh, I'm too excited!

208
00:16:33,053 --> 00:16:36,045
Springfield schools will be closed!

209
00:16:36,253 --> 00:16:38,209
All right!

210
00:16:41,173 --> 00:16:44,802
Come back, you're supposed
to eat breakfast!

211
00:16:45,453 --> 00:16:46,602
Cowabunga!

212
00:16:46,813 --> 00:16:50,408
Remember to take a break
if your arms go numb!

213
00:16:50,613 --> 00:16:55,641
Last night, you prayed for this.
Now your prayers have been answered.

214
00:16:55,853 --> 00:16:59,050
I don't know who
or what God is exactly.

215
00:16:59,293 --> 00:17:03,047
But he's more powerful
than Mom and Dad put together.

216
00:17:03,253 --> 00:17:05,005
And you owe him big.

217
00:17:05,173 --> 00:17:10,042
You're right. I asked for a miracle,
and I got it. I gotta study.

218
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:17,452
I'm not missing anything.
Frozen ears.

219
00:17:17,653 --> 00:17:22,602
Trudging up that stupid sled hill
over and over. How good could it be?

220
00:17:35,173 --> 00:17:37,733
I haven't had this much fun in years.

221
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:39,525
Gotcha, Burnsie.

222
00:17:40,173 --> 00:17:44,325
I was never one to back away
from a snowball fight.

223
00:17:44,573 --> 00:17:47,007
-Smithers, fire at will.
-Certainly.

224
00:17:51,973 --> 00:17:55,852
I hereby declare this day
to be Snow Day...

225
00:17:56,053 --> 00:18:00,012
...the funnest day
in the history of Springfield!

226
00:18:22,173 --> 00:18:24,164
Gotta study, gotta study!

227
00:18:27,893 --> 00:18:30,202
"Four Days in Philadelphia.

228
00:18:30,453 --> 00:18:33,286
The first Congress
faced a difficult job.

229
00:18:33,493 --> 00:18:37,452
Could they make decisions
that Americans could support?"

230
00:18:37,653 --> 00:18:40,247
We hold these truths
to be self-evident.

231
00:18:40,493 --> 00:18:43,769
We hold these truths
to be self-evident.

232
00:18:43,973 --> 00:18:46,692
That all men are created equal.

233
00:18:46,893 --> 00:18:50,602
That from that equal creation,
they derive rights--

234
00:18:50,813 --> 00:18:53,281
Look, everybody!
It's snowing!

235
00:18:53,493 --> 00:18:56,212
-In the middle of July?
-It's a miracle.

236
00:18:56,413 --> 00:18:59,405
I've invented something fun.
The sled.

237
00:19:02,973 --> 00:19:07,171
Look, John Hancock's
writing his name in the snow!

238
00:19:11,373 --> 00:19:15,605
Do you want to be held back a grade?
Concentrate, man!

239
00:19:23,613 --> 00:19:26,002
Later, Mrs. K.

240
00:19:28,693 --> 00:19:32,925
Please turn in your exam, Bart.
Class is over.

241
00:19:33,133 --> 00:19:36,409
-Could you grade it now?
-Well, all right.

242
00:19:36,653 --> 00:19:39,213
Let me get Old Red.

243
00:19:44,013 --> 00:19:46,652
It's a 59. That's another F.

244
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:49,287
Oh, no, I can't believe it.

245
00:19:49,493 --> 00:19:54,613
I know. Another year together.
It's gonna be hell.

246
00:19:59,613 --> 00:20:03,606
What's the matter?
I thought you'd be used to failing.

247
00:20:03,853 --> 00:20:08,881
No, you don't understand.
I tried this time. I really tried.

248
00:20:09,133 --> 00:20:10,486
There, there.

249
00:20:10,893 --> 00:20:14,124
This is as good as I can do,
and I still failed.

250
00:20:14,373 --> 00:20:17,206
Well, a 59. It's a high F.

251
00:20:17,453 --> 00:20:21,605
Who am I kidding?
I really am a failure.

252
00:20:22,213 --> 00:20:28,732
Now I know how Washington felt when
he surrendered Fort Necessity in 1754.

253
00:20:28,933 --> 00:20:32,448
You know, 1754.
The famous defeat to the French.

254
00:20:32,693 --> 00:20:35,287
-My God, Bart, you're right!
-So?

255
00:20:35,493 --> 00:20:37,961
You demonstrated applied knowledge.

256
00:20:38,173 --> 00:20:44,043
Such an obscure reference deserves
an extra point. It's only fair.

257
00:20:44,253 --> 00:20:47,609
-You mean I passed?
-Just barely.

258
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:51,123
I passed. I got a D minus!
I passed!

259
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,210
All right!

260
00:20:53,453 --> 00:20:57,446
I passed! I passed! I passed!
I got a D minus!

261
00:20:57,653 --> 00:21:00,929
I got a D minus! I passed!
I got a D minus!

262
00:21:01,133 --> 00:21:03,442
I passed! l--

263
00:21:03,653 --> 00:21:07,282
Kissed the teacher?!

264
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:13,252
We're proud of you.

265
00:21:13,493 --> 00:21:18,442
Thanks, Dad, but part of
this D minus belongs to God.
