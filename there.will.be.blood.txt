不！
No!
她在這兒，她在這兒
There she is. There she is.
她在這兒！
There she is.
各位女士先生
Ladies and gentlemen,
l've traveled over half our
state to be here tonight.
我跑了大半個美國
今晚來到了這裡
我暫且會留下來
l couldn't get away sooner
because my new well was coming in
因為我將在野狼山挖掘新油井
我得視察一下
at Coyote Hills
and l had to see about it.
這個井每週能產兩千桶油
That well is now flowing
at 2,000 barrels
每星期能給我
帶來五千美金的收益
and it's paying me an income
of $5,000 a week.
l have two others drilling
我還有另外兩處油井
在羚羊谷還有16處探勘地
and l have 16 producing
at Antelope,
so, ladies and gentlemen
各位女士先生，如果我說
我是一名油商，你們都會認同
if l say l'm an oilman,
you will agree.
現在你們有個大好的機會
Now, you have a great
chance here,
但要記住，一不小心
你可能一無所有
but bear in mind you could lose
it all if you're not careful.
那些祈求去探鑽你們土地的人
Out of all men that beg for
a chance to drill your lots,
maybe one in twenty
will be oilmen.
可能只有5%的人是石油商
其他的只是投機商
The rest will be speculators,
that's men trying to get
between you and the oilmen
也就是想在你和石油商之間
to get some of the money that
ought, by rights, come to you.
賺取一些本應是你的錢的
那些人
即使你們找到一個有資金
去鑽油的人
Even if you find one that
has money
and means to drill,
he'll maybe know nothing
about drilling.
也有可能他對探鑽一無所知
He'll have to hire the job
out on contract,
他不得不把工作承包給別人
然後你們只能依靠那個承包商
and then you're depending
on a contractor,
他會草草了事，以便可以
儘快承包另一份工作
who'll rush the job through
so he can get another contract
just as quick as he can.
This is the way that this works.
- 這就是運作模式
- 你能提供什麼？
What is your offer?
We're wasting time.
我們在浪費時間
Please!
我自己做探鑽
l do my own drilling.
為我工作的人
And the men that work for me,
都是我熟悉的人
work for me and they are
men l know.
l make it my business to be
there and to see their work.
我的生意在那兒
我會監督他們的工作
我不會把工具掉在井裡
然後花幾個月時間再去找
l don't lose my tools in the hole
and spend months fishing for them.
我不會粗陋地修補水泥井
讓水流進去破壞整塊地
l don't botch the cementing off
and let water in the hole
and ruin the whole lease.
我是個重家庭的男人
我打理的是家庭生意
l'm a family man.
l run a family business
This is my son and my partner,
H.W. Plainview.
他既是我的兒子，也是我的
合作夥伴，H.W.卜倫維
我們提供一種家庭式的隊伍
We offer you the bond of family
那是很少油商能懂的
that very few oilmen
can understand.
我在這一行業的成熟
其他公司很難企及
l'm fixed like no other
company in this field
那是因為我的野狼山油井
已經開始建立了
and that's because my Coyote Hills
well has just come in.
我有探鑽隊，他們隨時隨地
都可以投入工作
l have a string of tools
all ready to put to work.
我可以在一週內
把探鑽機用卡車運到這裡
l can load a rig onto trucks
and have them here in a week.
我有一定的生意關係
l have business connections
so l can get the lumber
for the derricks.
所以我可以取得做油井架
的木材
有了人際關係，這些事
才能在短期內辦好
Such things go by friendship
in a rush like this.
這就是為何
我能保證開始探鑽工作
And this is why l can
guarantee to start drilling
以及能提供所需資金
and to put up the cash
to back my word.
l assure you, ladies and gentlemen,
我保證，各位女士先生
不管別人是如何承諾
no matter what the others
promise to do,
一旦最後關頭
他們肯定落荒而逃
when it comes to the showdown,
they won't be there.
Sit down! Sit down,
you have no right...
Let us discuss
what the man has to say.
Let us discuss what the
man has to say.
Prescott, do you trust
this man?
Let's discuss
what he has to say.
There's logic to
what he's saying.
How does he know?
My lot is there!
Two or three years,
it could be ten years!
We gain nothing
by losing our heads!
Look at that well out there!
Nobody's losing their heads.
You have no business being here!
Sit that woman down, sir!
You can sit down.
Mr. Plainview! Please,
Mr. Plainview.
No, Mr. Plainview!
No, where are you going?
卜倫維先生
卜倫維先生，您要去哪兒？
l don't need the lease.
Thank you.
我不需要這片租地，謝謝
But we need you.
- 不，我們需要您
- 太多顧慮了
Too much confusion.
Thank you for your time.
- 謝謝你
- 不…沒有顧慮
No, no, there's no confusion.
如果這地是送的話，我會考慮
l wouldn't take the lease
if you gave it to me as a gift.
班克賽先生
我不想浪費大家的時間了
Mr. Bankside, l'm not going
to waste your time.
l'd certainly appreciate it
if you didn't waste mine.
如果您願意與我簽約的話
我們可以十天內開始探鑽石油
Now, if you wish to sign with me
we can have a well drilling
within 10 days.
你的土地相距已發現的油井
更靠北一點
Your lot is further north from
the discovery well up here.
因此意味著
我們可能要挖深一點
That means we'll probably
have to dig deeper.
如果這裡的石油
如我想像中一般多
And if there's as much
oil here as l think there is,
那將會更難取得
it'll be harder to reach, but once
we find it, we can take it right out.
但一旦找到了
我們可以馬上開始生產
但動作要快
We have to act quickly, because
very soon these fields will be dry.
因為過不了多久
這一片地會乾旱
我想知道你打算怎麼做
l need you to know
what you want to do.
由於與已發現的油井相距較遠
Now, because of the distance
from the discovery well,
給你們的抽成會相對少一點
l'll pay you a smaller royalty
than you'd get down there
但我會出1000美金買您的地
but l'm prepared to give you
a $1 ,000 bonus on your lot.
What kind of royalty are
you talking about?
- 你說的抽成是多少？
- 六分之一
Onesixth, plus a guarantee to
start drilling within 10 days.
再加十天內開採的保證
那是你們在別處找不到的
Now, that's something you
won't find anywhere else.
你們的孩子多大了？
What age are your children,
ma'am?
10歲和12歲
Ten and twelve.
卜倫維先生，我有一個問題
您的妻子呢？
Mr. Plainview, a question,
sir. Where is your wife?
She died in childbirth,
Mrs. Bankside.
她難產死了，班克賽夫人
現在只有我和我兒子
So it's just me and my son now.
lt's coming in, boss!
Hear it?
- 卜倫維先生
- 是的
Mr. Plainview?
Yes?
Are you Daniel Plainview?
您是丹尼爾.卜倫維嗎？
是的
Yes.
有什麼事？
What can l do for you?
You look for oil.
你在找石油嗎？
沒錯
That's right.
What do you pay for a place
that has it?
買一塊有石油的地
您出什麼價錢？
Well, that depends....
What does it depend on?
- 看情況而定
- 看什麼情況？
很多情況
On a lot of things.
如果我說
我知道某塊地有石油
lf l told you l knew a place that had
oil where land could be bought cheaply,
而那塊地
可以用很便宜的價錢買到
what do you think that
would be worth?
你覺得這個消息值多少錢？
我覺得
你應該把知道的告訴我
l think that you should
let me know what you know
and then we'll try and work
something out.
那樣我們可以商量商量
- 我可以坐嗎？
- 請坐
Can l sit down?...Please.
您信什麼教的？
What church do you belong to?
l...
我…
l enjoy all faiths. l don't belong
to one church in particular.
我什麼都信
我不屬於任何一個宗教
我都喜歡，我什麼都喜歡
你是哪裡人？
l like them all. l like everything.
Where are you from?
That would be telling you.
That's what l want to sell you.
我先不告訴你
那就是我向您推薦的地方
What are you doing in Signal Hill?
你在信號山做什麼？
We have oil, and it seeps
through the ground.
我們那裡的石油
從地裡滲漏出來
Do you want to pay me to know
where it is?
你想買我這個消息嗎？
Just 'cause there's something
on the ground
地表有油，並不代表地下也有
doesn't mean there's anything
beneath it.
Why did Standard Oil buy
up land?
那為什麼 "通用石油"
會收購我們的地？
ls it in California?
- 在加州嗎？
- 也許
Maybe....How much land did
they buy?
他們收購了多少地？
l'd like it better if you didn't
think l was stupid.
別以為我是笨蛋
Why did you come to me?
那你來找我幹嘛？
You just brought this well in....
That's right.
您鑽了這個油井
對
Yes, so just give me $500
in cash right now
所以，只要立刻給我500美金
我就告訴您地址
and l'll tell you where it is.
l'll tell you what l'll do,
son. l'll give you $100 now,
我跟你說，孩子
我先給你100美元
如果事實證明
那裡是可以賺錢的地方
and if it proves to be a
promising lease
我會給你1000美元獎金
then give you a $1 ,000 bonus.
Six hundred dollars.
只要600美元就可以
Tell me one thing to help me decide.
What else have you got up there?
你要告訴我一件事
好讓我下決定
你們那兒還有些什麼？
What do you grow?
你們種植些什麼？
We have a big ranch,
but it's mostly rocks.
我們有一個大牧場
但大多數是岩石
Plant things. Nothing will
grow but weeds.
無論種什麼…都只會長雜草
What makes you think it's up?
不然你認為會長什麼？
ls there sulfur around?
Or alkali deposits?
附近有硫磺或鹼化物嗎？
Alkali nearby.

有鹼化物
不知道有沒有硫磺

如果我們在那邊紮營的話
我們不會妨礙到你們

Dad, look at my shoe.
That's earthquake oil.

是地震洩漏出來的石油
- 所以…
- 所以？
So...
So?
So, so.
如果有石油
我們可以把它送到海邊
lf there's anything here,
we take it to the sea.
我們要做的是建立一條穿到
華尼米港或聖保羅的輸油管
What we do is we build a pipeline
to Port Hueneme or Santa Paula,
大約要100英哩長
it's about 100 miles,
我們會和聯合石油公司合作
and we do a deal with Union Oil
This is what we do.
我們就這樣做
我們不再需要鐵路
和花費運輸的費用，懂嗎？
Then we don't need the railroads
and their shipping costs anymore.
You see?
- 懂
- 你懂？
Yeah.
You see that?...Yeah.
對
Then we're making money.
We're making the real money.
然後我們就能賺錢了
我們就能真正賺到…
What we should be making.
Not just...
我們應該賺到的錢
而不把錢浪費在運輸費上
Not just throwing it away
on shipping costs.
Otherwise, it's just mud.
否則這些石油都沒用
我們付他們多少錢？
How much are we going to pay them?
付給誰？
Who's that?
桑德一家
The Sunday family.
l'm not going to give them oil prices.
我不給他們石油的價錢

l'll give them quail prices.
lf we could take a few minutes,
給我幾分鐘時間
我有事要和您談
there's something l'd very
much like to talk with you about.
媽媽，先把女孩們帶出去好嗎
Mother, would you take the
girls outside, please?
恕我直言
l believe in plain speaking, so...
This is a beautiful ranch.
l love hunting for quail.
這是個美麗的牧場
我喜歡獵鵪鶉
My boy has been sick, you know.
我兒子病了，您知道
他需要新鮮空氣
He needs fresh air.
Doctors all say he needs
plentiful fresh air.
醫生說他需要多點新鮮空氣
So,
您說這塊地，要多少錢
才適合呢，亞博？
what would you say would be a
fair price for this lot, Abel?
To buy this place?...That's right.
- 買這塊地？
- 對
想一想
Take a moment.
l'm sorry. l don't know....
Six dollars an acre.
- 抱歉，我不清楚
- 每英畝六美元
Six dollars? Thank you, Eli.
六美元，謝謝，伊萊
And then with the improvements to
the ranch over the years at $500...
還花了500美元修葺這個牧場
l'd like to offer you $3,700
for this ranch.
我願意出3700美元花這個牧場
是3700美元
That's $3,700....No.
不行          - 是上帝
派這位先生來的，伊萊
The Lord has sent this man
here, Eli.
是啊，我相信上帝派我來
我會付您3700美元
Yes, l believe He has.
My offer to you is $3,700.
What is it that brought
you here, sir?
您為何而來，先生？
The Good Lord's guidance.
因上帝的指引而來
Now, of course, within that...
當然我們會草擬一份合約
What about our oil?
...we're going to develop a lease.
- 你說什麼？
- 那我們的石油呢？
What's that?...What about our oil?
- 那怎樣？
- 我們這裡有石油，值一點錢
What about it?
We have oil here.
That's worth something.
Do you have someone who can
drill for it?
有人幫你們探鑽嗎？
你覺得這裡有石油？
Do you think there's oil here?...
l know there is.
- 我知道有
- 探鑽石油很費用很高的
lt's very expensive to drill.
To get it up and out of the ground.
You ever tried that before?
把它弄到地表上面來
你試過了嗎？
How much is it?...Costly.
- 要多少錢？
- 很昂貴
Well, our oil sits right up
on top of the ground.
我們的石油就在地表
l believe that's called seepage.
我認為那只是滲漏出來的
地下不一定有
Doesn't necessarily mean
there's anything underneath.
What would you give us for it?...
l don't know.
- 你打算付我們多少錢？
- 我不知道
Something you don't know....
That's right.
- 你不知道？
- 對
你想要多少，伊萊？
What would you like, Eli?
Ten thousand dollars.
一萬美元
- 要來幹嘛？
- 給我的教會
For what?
For my church.
That's good.
很好
That's a good one.
很好
Well...
如果我們決定探鑽石油…
lf we decide to drill for oil
and if the well begins to produce,
如果油井開始生產
l'll give your church a
$5,000 signing bonus.
我會給你的教會五千美元
的簽約金
Ten thousand.
一萬
Do you want to find someone else that's
going to come here and drill, Eli?
你想找其他人來這兒探鑽嗎？
伊萊？
有人會對這種工作投資金錢
Make the investment and do all
the hard work that goes into it?
和大量勞動力嗎？
l can just as easily hunt for quail
on another ranch as l can here, so...
我大可以在別的牧場獵鵪鶉
只要可以
我很樂意資助你的教會
Though l'll happily be a supporter
of your church for as long as l can.
For the bonus only.
但謹是簽約金
Now, as it happens, l do have some
connections in the drilling business
我確實和石油生意有些關係
who might help get us started.
How do you feel about this, Abel?
他們也許可以幫我們開始
您認為怎麼樣，亞博？
Yes. What Eli says.
好，就像伊萊說的做吧
Well, good! Let's draw up some
contracts and let's...
好，我們簽個約，試試看吧
Let's give it a try.
Appreciate your help with this, Eli.
很感謝你的幫助，伊萊
Good afternoon....Good afternoon.

那裡是貝文斯的
要拿是肯定沒問題的

- 當然
Can everything around here be got?
Sure.
保羅.桑德
果然是我們的好朋友
Paul Sunday turned out to be
a good friend of ours.
對
That's right.
你儘快來這裡
Well, you get here just as soon
as you can. Bring Fred English.
把佛萊.英格帶過來

Good enough.
Thank you, porter.
謝謝你，服務員

You boys are a little late.
What did you find?...l found
some interesting prospects.

- 我發現很不錯的前景
你聽說"通用石油"收購了嗎？
- 目前基本上都在北方
Did you hear Standard bought up?
Mostly in the north, so far....
That's what l hear.
我聽說了
l'm gonna tell you, Gene, if you're
gonna make a play, look east.
我跟你說，金恩，如果你想
有所收穫，向東走
如果這附近有地被人收購
我希望那個人是你不是別人
l'd rather it be you than
someone else
This mud around here has
been taken.
lt must be easy when you
have such a cute face
你有這張的小臉蛋跟著闖蕩
江湖…生活一定很美滿吧
to carry around with you.
Telling me how handsome my
son is?...Well, that l am.
你在稱讚我兒子有多帥嗎？
- 是的
- 太好了，謝謝
That's very nice. Thank you.
Good luck, Gene.
祝你好運…金恩
聽我說，向東走
Take care....Like l said, go east.
H.W.
我願意做你的律師
如果你想簽一份合約…
l'll be your lawyer if you
need to draw up a contract.
來保證你不會被耍
拿到你爸爸的一半利潤
Make sure you don't get
swindled, boy.
Get half what your dad's making.
How's that?
那些人在幹嘛？
What are those men doing?
都是替咱們工作的
他們只是到處看看
They're just guys
that are working for us.
They're just looking around.
咱們能賺多少錢？
How much money can we make?
l don't know. lt depends.
不知道，不好說…
一千美元？
One thousand dollars?
Mary said that her father
beats her if she doesn't pray.
瑪莉說她要是不祈禱
就會挨她爸爸打
Mary, she's the smaller one?
瑪莉是年紀稍小的那女孩？
Yes, she is.
對，就是她
Everyone here?...Very successful.
- 都來了吧？
- 差不多都來了
But?
只是？
There were a few vacant
lots and one holdout.
誰？
Who?...William Bandy.
- 威廉.班迪
- 他是誰？
...eight. Who's he?
一個老頭，他家世代住這兒
He's an old man who
homesteaded here.
他跟孫子一起過…
說想跟你談談
Lives with his grandson. He
said he'd like to speak with you.
- 他來了嗎？
- 沒有，他想請你去他家談
ls he here?
No, he'd like you to come
visit with him.
他是嫌錢少
He's boosting his price.
他說不管誰來買這塊地
他都會跟那人談談
He said he'd like to speak with
whoever is doing the buying.
好吧，那他就等吧
他會來找我的，咱們走
Well, let him wait. He'll
come around. Let's go.
Ladies and gentlemen?
各位女士先生
Ladies and gentlemen.
非常感謝大家今晚能過來
Thank you so much for visiting
with us this evening.
我跑了半個美國
到這來處理這塊地
Now, l've traveled across half our state
to be here and to see about this land.
Now, l daresay some of you
可能你們有些人聽到些謠言…
might have heard
some of the more extravagant
rumors about what my plans are,
把我的計畫都說得天花亂墜了
so l just thought you'd like
to hear it from me.
我想，大家應該還是希望
我來…
面對面地，開誠佈公地
跟大夥談談的
This is the face.
lt's no great mystery.
我是個做石油生意的
各位女士先生
l'm an oilman, ladies and gentlemen,
l have numerous concerns
spread across this state.
我的生意遍佈全國
l have many wells flowing at
many thousand barrels per day,
每天，都有成千上萬桶原油
從我的那些油井裡流向市場
so l like to think of
myself as an oilman.
我比較樂意
把自己看成個油商
As an oilman, l hope that
you'll forgive
做為一個油商，希望大家
不要介意這種粗俗的叫法
just good oldfashioned plain
speaking.
我們所從事的這種工作
是家族性質的
Now, this work that we do is
very much a family enterprise.
l work side by side with my
wonderful son, H. W.
我和我引以為豪的兒子H.W.
一起工作
l think one or two of you
might have met him already.
我想你們中已經有人見過他了
And l encourage my men
同樣，我也鼓勵員工的
家人們…
to bring their families, as well.
Of course, it makes for an ever
so much more rewarding life for them.
加入這一收入較高的行業
家庭的未來在於孩子
Family means children, and
children means education.
而孩子的未來在於教育
所以不管我們在哪探井…
So, wherever we set up camp,
education is a necessity,
從不會忽略員工子女的教育
問題，我們也很樂意這麼做
and we're just so happy to
take care of that.
所以咱們也在小波士頓
建一所設施優良的學校吧
So let's build a wonderful
school in Little Boston.
孩子是咱們拚死拚活的奔頭
These children are the future
that we strive for,
and so they should have the
very best of things.
所以咱們應該
把最好的都給他們
Now, something else,
不過現在…大家別嫌我說話
難聽，我想說說麵包的問題
and please don't be insulted
if l speak about this. Bread.
咱們來談談麵包
Let's talk about bread.
Now, to my mind, it's an
abomination to consider
我知道，不管是對男人
女人，還是孩子們來說…
that any man, woman, or child
in this magnificent country of ours
在這麼富饒的國家
把麵包看做奢侈品…
是很荒唐的
should have to look upon a
loaf of bread as a luxury.
我們可以打井取水
We're going to dig water wells here,
and water wells means irrigation.
有了水就能灌溉農田
田裡有了水就能長出莊稼
lrrigation means cultivation.
我們也要在這開墾耕種
We're going to raise crops here where
before it just simply wasn't possible.
能結出比糧食更有用的東西
You're going to have more grain
than you'll know what to do with,
and bread will be coming right
out of your ears, ma'am.
公路，你們的就業
New roads, agriculture,
employment, education.
孩子們的教育，這些
都只是很小的一部份
These are just a few of the
things we can offer you,
and l assure you,
ladies and gentlemen,
而且我向在座的各位保證
如果這兒能探到石油…
that if we do find oil here,
當然，我覺得是大有希望的
and l think there's a very
good chance that we will,
那你們的生活水準，將不再
只是溫飽，而是十分富足
this community of yours
will not only survive
it will flourish.
l'd be happy to answer any questions
that you might have. Yes?
大家有問題儘管提吧…
- 請講
- 公路會修到教堂嗎？
Will the new road lead
to the church?
That'll be the first place that it
leads. Thank you, Eli. Anyone else?
我們上來就把去教堂的路修好
謝謝，伊萊，還有嗎？
Well, if anything comes up,
l'm pretty easy to find.
好吧，如果有問題
我會及時解決的
You just come visit with me.
真的很感謝大家
能抽時間過來
Thank you so much for your time,
and good night.
What a privilege to carry
everything to God in prayer!
What a privilege to carry...
Just follow the new road right
to the church.
The new road will lead you there.
Hello, brother, my name is Eli.
The Church of the
Third Revelation welcomes you.
Hello, brother, my name is Eli.
The Church of the
Third Revelation welcomes you.
Just follow the new road
right to the church.
Jesus knows our every weakness
Take it to the Lord in prayer
Are we weak and heavyladen
Cumbered with a load of care?
Precious Savior still our refuge
Take it to the Lord in prayer...
Daniel, may l speak with you?...
Yes, come in.
- 丹尼爾，能跟你談談嗎？
- 當然，進來吧
l'll bring them up when
they arrive.
- 早安
- 早安
Good morning....Good morning.
- 進展都還順利吧？
- 都很順利
How is all the work coming?
Everything's good.
- 大家都能各盡所能嗎？
- 當然
All the men are provided for?...
Of course.
大家幹勁十足啊
Spirits seem high.
有什麼用得著我的地方嗎？
ls there anything that you
need from me?
Anything the church can do for you?
我是說，用得著教堂的地方
l don't believe so. No. Thank you.
我想沒有吧，謝謝了
l understand you've asked
the people to gather around
我知道，明天
你會把大家都召集起來…
看著鑽頭開鑽
and watch the well begin
tomorrow. ls that right?
- 對嗎？
- 對
That's right....
l will bless the well.
我會為油井祈禱的
你們開始前
你先把我介紹給大家
Before you begin,
you should introduce me.
到時候，我會繞著油井
和那個東西走
You'll see me walk up towards
the oil well, and when l...
油井架
The derrick.
You'll see me walk up, and
then you could say my name.
我走的時候
你喊我的名字就行了
- 你走的時候？
- 對，我會沿著井走
When you walk up?
Yes. You'll see me walk up,
and then you could say,
然後你就可以說
"擎著父輩旗幟的…"
''The proud son of these hills
who tended his Father's flock,''
"山之驕子啊…"
然後說出我的名字
and then you could say my name.
- 還不錯
- 那接下來呢？
That's fine.
And what happens then?
Well, then we start the drill.
我們就開始鑽井了
要做個簡單的禱告
丹尼爾，這很重要
lt's a simple blessing, Daniel,
but an important one.
lt's just a few words.
lt won't take long.
只要幾句話就行，不會太久
What time?...What time's
good for you, Eli?
- 什麼時候開始？
- 你什麼時候有空呢？伊萊
- 四點鐘
- 好，那就四點
4:00....Well,
let's make it 4:00 then.
感謝你的來訪
My thanks for your visit....
Good day. Thank you.
好的，謝謝
Afternoon, everyone.
各位午安
Come with me.
非常感謝大家的到來
l thank you all so much for
visiting with us at this time.
l've had the pleasure of
meeting some of you
我有幸見過了你們其中
一些人…
and l hope very much in the
months to come,
並且非常期待，在今後的
一個月裡，能夠認識每一個人
l'll be able to visit with
each and every one of you.
l'm better at digging holes in
the ground than making speeches,
我比較擅長鑽洞，嘴比較笨
so let's forget the speech
for this evening,
所以咱們也不多說了
還是做個簡單的禱告吧
just make it a simple blessing.
大家都知道，獨木難成林
這需要每一個像你們…
You see, one man doesn't
prospect from the ground.
lt takes a whole community of
good people, such as yourselves,
一樣優秀的人共同的努力
大家齊心協力才能有所做為
and this is good. We stay together.
咱們一起祈禱，一起勞作
We pray together, we work together,
如果仁慈的上帝
能肯定咱們的勞動…
and if the Good Lord smiles
kindly on our endeavor,
那咱們還會一起豐收
we share in the wealth together.
現在，在咱們開挖
瑪莉一號油井之前…
Now, before we spud in Mary's
Well Number One,
named for the lovely Miss Mary
Sunday, here by my side,
也就是以我身邊這位，可愛的
瑪莉.桑德小姐命名的這口井
這位山之嬌女
a proud daughter of these hills,
我想說，願上帝保佑我們
誠懇的勞作
l'd just like to say God bless these
honest labors of ours, and, of course,
當然，也保佑大家
God bless you all.
阿門
Amen.
Now go.
Won't be a minute.
不會太久
Fast as you can, H.W.
動作快點，H.W.
Are you ready to do this?
成功了，各位女士先生
That's it, ladies and gentlemen!
艾爾.羅斯十分慷慨
他自己掏錢…
Al Rose has very generously provided
some refreshments for this occasion
給大家準備了些好吃的，謝謝
out of his own pocket. Thank you, Al.
大家別愣著了，盡情享用吧
我一會就過去
lf you'll all just care to help
yourselves, l'll be back in a minute.
Mary.
Mary Sunday.
- 喜歡這件新裙子嗎？
- 喜歡，謝謝
Do you like your new dress?...
Yes. Thank you.
You're welcome. l thought
you'd like it.
不用客氣，我猜你就會喜歡
- 我來這你高興嗎？
- 嗯
Are you happy l came here?...Yes.
你爸爸不打你了吧？是嗎？
Your daddy doesn't hit you anymore,
does he? Does he now?
最好是不打了，對嗎？
我會照顧你的
Better not, right?
l'll take care of you.
再也不讓你挨打了，好嗎？
再也不挨打了，去吧
No more hitting, right?
No more hitting. Now go.
去好好玩吧，不用過來了
Go and play some more and
don't come back.
Daniel?
lt's okay, H.W. Go back to sleep.
Go on. Go back to sleep.
沒事，H.W.，睡你的覺吧
丹尼爾
Daniel.
丹尼爾
Daniel.
- 丹尼爾！
- 什麼事？
Daniel!
Daniel!
What?
井下死了個工人
Lost a man down the well.
- 哪一個？
- 喬伊.甘哈
What man?...Joe Gundha.
- 我認識嗎？
- 不認識
Did l know him?...No.
What happened?
怎麼回事？
Pick it up.
Set the brake.
Tie it down....Tie it on.
Shit!
該死
God damn it. Where's the body?
- 屍體呢？
- 我們正在撈
They're fishing it out now....
All right.
- 鑽頭呢？
- 在起重機下面
Where's the bit?...
lt's on the deck.
給他洗洗，換件衣服
Clean him up.
Put some clothes on him.
然後…搭個帳篷
And...
Set up a tent.
每個人都要下井的時候
都要互相告知
Anyone goes down into the cellar,
you tell somebody. Yes?
- 好嗎？
- 好的，先生
Yes, sir....Yes, sir.
中午前先別說出去
Shut down till midday.
And l had a vision.
Yes, last night, l had a vision
and l felt God's breath move
through me.
And it rolled down into
my stomach.
來到我的胃裡
駐足停留
lt sloshed around.
於是我的胃開始傾訴
低聲細語，而非大聲疾呼
And my stomach spoke in a
whisper, not a shout,
"用你的雙手，輕撫這個女人
並醫治她吧"
''Touch this woman with your
hands and caress her.'' Yes.
親愛的杭特夫人
您有關節炎，是嗎？
My dear Mrs. Hunter,
you have arthritis, don't you?
對，是的，伊萊
Yes, l do, Eli....Yes.
對，病魔就在您的手上
我會把它驅離
The devil is in your hands,
and l will suck it out.
我不會用高溫將它趕走
Now, l will not cast this
ghost out with a fever
因為我體內的聖靈告訴我說
有一種全新的溝通方式
for the new spirit inside me has shown
me l have a new way to communicate.
那就是，溫柔地細語
lt is a gentle whisper.
出來吧，小鬼
Get out of here, ghost.
出來吧，小鬼
Get out of here, ghost.
出來吧
Get out.
出來吧，小鬼
Get out of here, ghost.
出來吧，小鬼
Get out of here, ghost.
...and enter this woman's body now.
出來吧，小鬼
Get out of here, ghost.
出來吧，不允許你轉身回頭
Get out of here. Don't you dare
turn around and come back.
For if you do,
如果你敢，我的聖靈戰士
就會用牙齒將你撕碎
all the armies of my boot
will kick you in the teeth
and you will be cast up and
thrown in the dirt
你將被拋入泥潭
永世不得翻身
and thrust back to perdition!
只要還有牙齒，我就要撕咬你
And as long as l have teeth,
l will bite you,
即使牙齒沒了，也要啃噬你
and if l have no teeth,
l will gum you!
只要還有雙拳
我就要暴打你！
And as long as l have fists,
l will bash you!
現在，出來吧，小鬼！
Now, get out of here, ghost!
Get out of here, ghost!
出來吧，小鬼！
Get out of here, ghost!
它被趕走了！
And it left!
Hallelujah!...Hallelujah!
哈利路亞！
這是神聖的日子
Praise the Lord and his holy
days!...Praise God!
Amen! Thank you....Thank you,
Jesus. Thank you, God.
My dear Mrs. Hunter.
親愛的杭特太太
跟我一起舞蹈吧
Dance with me.
Thanks for coming....
lt was a wonderful sermon.
- 這個儀式真是太神奇了
- 明天再過來
Will l see you tomorrow?...Yes.
一定
伊萊
Eli.
Had a tragedy at
the well last night.
昨晚，井下發生了
很慘痛的事故
我聽說了
Yes, l heard.
喬伊.甘哈是個很虔誠的教徒
Joe Gundha was a man of
considerable faith.
明天中午，希望您能來參加
他的葬禮，講幾句話
So if you wish to say a few words,
his burial is at noon tomorrow.
丹尼爾
這起事故本可以避免的
Daniel, this accident could
have been avoided.
- 真的很難想像，這些工人…
- 是的，本可以避免，如果…
lt is terrible to think of
that well
working away out there...
要連續幹上12個小時的
重體力活，他們需要休息
These men work in 12hour shifts.
unblessed....They need their rest.
如果他們不休息
他們就會犯些愚蠢的錯誤
lf they don't have it, they
start to make stupid mistakes.
l've seen the men drinking
我看到有些工人在喝酒
你不覺得…
Don't you think that has
something to do with this?
他們喝點酒，休息好了
才能下井工作…
We need these men wellrested
to bring in this well.
坐在上面聽你講福音
是挖不到油的
They can't get that if they're
up here listening to your gospel,
那些井也成不了聚寶盆
and then the well can't produce
and blow gold all over the place.
如果喬伊.甘哈能多來幾次
教堂，也不會這樣
l wish l had more time with
Joe Gundha.
More could have been done.
而井也出不了油…
Then the well can't produce and
blow gold all over the place.
這個地方也脫不了貧
致不了富
你能幫忙把他的遺物
轉交給他家人嗎？
Now, would you see to it that
his personal possessions
find their way back to his
family, please?
謝謝
Thank you.
教堂該修修了
Heard you were planning
some renovations.
是啊，來這兒的人越來越多
Yes, our congregation is
growing strongly.
教堂得擴建了
We need more room.
That was one goddamn hell
of a show.
剛才那場戲真是爛透了
很高興你能來捧場，丹尼爾
We were happy to have you,
Daniel.
Gas, gas, gas!
把燈掐滅！
Lights out! Wait here.
Wait here. Lights out!
在這等著！在這等著！
把火滅了
Put that fire out!
ls he hurt? H.W.!
Hand him down to me!
把他放下來
Hand him down!...Here.
- 這兒
- 把他放下來
Got him?...l've got him!
Oh, God.
Come on.
Open the door.
Let go. There you go.
You're safe. You're safe.
躺好，沒事了，沒事了…
沒事了，我在呢
You're safe now. l got you here.
You're safe. Let go, son.
傷著哪了？
Tell me where it hurts. Tell me
where it hurts. Tell me where...
- 你看見他撞哪了嗎？
- 沒有
Did you see this?...No.
哪裡疼啊？傷著哪了？
Tell me where it hurts.
Where does it hurt you?
Where does it hurt you?
我聽不見了
l can't hear my voice.
撞到頭了？
Were you hit in the head?
撞到頭了，是嗎？
Were you hit in the head? Tell me!
You have to tell me if you were!
說話啊，告訴我啊
我聽不見了
l can't hear my voice.
在這等著我，好嗎？
l have to go and deal with this
now. You wait here for me.
You understand?
You wait here for me.
在這等著我，我這就回來
l'll be back.
l'll be back in a minute.
馬上就回來，在這等著
Wait here....Don't leave!
- 別…
- 我得過去看看，躺好
l'm going to take care of you.
Wait.
Stay here, son.
l'm going to fix this.
- 我得過去看看
- 別…
Don't leave!...
You're going to be fine!
我不會有事的
Wait for me here!
Hold him down. Hold him down....
Don't leave!
Got to break the cables, Daniel!
Get me a hammer!
Get me a hammer!
Here you go.
Get back!
- 麥克
- 我在呢
Michael!...Sir!
把油管撤掉
找人去弄些水管來
Take Dave and two of the fellas,
pick up some hoses...
比利，把那邊的東西收起來
那邊一會就溫度太高了
Billy, protect the roof. Don't
wait before it gets too hot.
幹嘛一幅苦瓜臉？
What are you looking so
miserable about?
咱們在腳下挖到個石油海洋啊
There's a whole ocean of oil
under our feet!
除了我沒人能挖到
No one can get at it
except for me.
H.W.沒事吧？
H.W. okay?
不太好
No, he isn't.
- 他人呢？
- 在餐廳裡
Where is he?...Mess room.
好了…H.W.，不哼哼了
That's enough now. That's enough,
H.W. That's enough.
聽見了嗎？能聽見我說話嗎？
Do you hear me? Can you hear
me in there?
沒事了
That's enough.
Grab his legs....l have his legs.
No. Nope....No, lad.
Give me that.
Steady. That's it.
- 是爸爸，沒事的
- 放輕鬆，孩子，放輕鬆
Easy, boy. Easy....Soon be over.
- 很快就好了
- 對，好乖
Yeah, and that's good. Now
the other side. Turn him over.
- 該那邊了
- 把他轉過來
Almost done.
That's it.
Come here. lt's over. lt's over.
別…別亂動
我們在三藩市有認識人嗎？
Who do we know in San Francisco
or Los Angeles,
who could work with...
在洛杉磯有可以幫忙的人嗎？
為了H.W.
我們可以找人教她(手語)
You know, we could... Someone,
a teacher for H.W.
你覺得怎麼樣？
How could you figure out that?
請一流的……該死
他叫什麼來著？
Now, call... God damn it
God damn it, what's his name?
三藩市的鮑伯.包迪？
Bob Brody in San Francisco?
Call Bob Brody and get
someone down here.
對，鮑伯.包迪是一流的
把他叫來
l'll do it right away.
我馬上去辦
When do we get our money, Daniel?
我們什麼時候能拿到錢
丹尼爾？
Aren't you a healer? And a
vessel for the Holy Spirit?
你不是個醫師嗎？
還是聖靈的化身？
When are you coming over
and make my son hear again?
你什麼能來把我兒子的
耳聾治好？
難道你不行嗎？
Can't you do that?
lf you had let me bless the well,
his wouldn't have happened.
你本應讓我保佑那井的…
Daniel....You shouldn't have
done that.
You owe the Church of the
Third Revelation $5,000
根據部份我們達成的協定
你欠第三啟示教堂五千美元
as part of the arrangement
that we made!
Don't even try it, you little
runt! You splash around in here.
別想反抗，侏儒…
我要讓你狗啃泥…
That's it, that's it.
就這樣…
l'm going to bury you underground,
Eli.
我要把你埋在地下，伊萊
l'm going to bury you underground.
我要把你埋在地下
You are a stupid man, Abel.
你是個蠢貨，亞博
You've let someone come in
here and walk all over us.
你引狼入室
You let him in and do his
work here,
你讓他來…
幹事業…
and you are a stupid man for
what we could have had.
你的愚蠢讓我們損失慘重
l followed His word, Eli. l tried.
我聽過他的話
伊萊，我試過了
你只是坐視不理
You didn't do anything but sit down.
你又懶又蠢
You're lazy, and you're stupid.
Do you think God is going
to save you for being stupid?
你以為上帝會因你的愚蠢
救你嗎？
He doesn't save stupid people,
Abel.
他不救蠢貨，亞博
l will tear you apart for what
you've done, you stupid man!
你這個蠢貨
How did he come here?
Do you really know? l know!
他怎麼來的？你知道嗎？
- 我知道，閉嘴！
- 兒子，你難道…求你…
Son, don't do this, please!...
Be quiet!
閉嘴，亞博
Shut your mouth, Abel!
lt was your stupid son!
是你那蠢兒子保羅告訴他來的
我知道
lt was Paul who told him to
come here. l know it.
He went to him and he said,
他過去對他說:
''My stupid, weak father
will give away his lots.
我那愚蠢無能的父親
會獻出土地，過去拿吧…
''Go and take him.''
And you let it happen.
你還真讓這話成真了
A stupid father to a stupid son.
蠢爹無智子
Get out of there!
能幫忙嗎？
Can l help you?
Daniel?
丹尼爾？
Who's that?...My name is Henry.
你是誰？
我叫亨利
什麼？
Yeah?

瑪麗.布蘭絲…？是你母親？
是的，先生，正是
l read about your gusher in
the paper, about your success.
我從報紙上得知
你石油事業的成功
你聽說我發大財了
就冒出來了？
You heard about my strike?
You just show up?
父親去世了
Our father's dead.
厄尼斯去世了，我聽說的
Ernest died, l heard.
l wanted to find you.
我想找到你
- 什麼時候？
- 三個月前
When?
Three months ago. l got a
letter from Annabelle.

剛才很抱歉，先生
你的牛排馬上就好
So that green turtle soup is

Sounds good to me.
So Standard offered us a
million dollars
"通用"公司願意出資
一億美金…
for the Little Boston leases.
購買我租用波士頓的契約
我告訴提福先生，讓他省點錢
l told H.M. Tilford where
he could shove that.
And we made a deal with Union!
On the pipeline!
我已經和聯合公司達成協議
關於輸油管道
還有我們腳下的石油海洋
And that whole ocean of oil
underneath our fields.
...$150,000....Yes.
We needed the money to drill.
Who is this guy?...
l go out to meet him.
He's getting oil on the property.
We're trying to make a claim on it.
Offered him a million dollars.
Turned us down flat....
Well, l'm hungry.
Orange fritters, mashed potatoes,
green peas.
All the way around?...All right.
好吧
Hold on.
請你向那邊看
l want you to look over there.
Daniel, let me introduce...
- 丹尼爾，讓我給你介紹…

Look over there. You see?
那是我的兒子，你看見他了嗎
- 是的
That's my son. See him?
Yes....Do you see?
你看見了？
我看見他了

不用你來教訓我怎麼撫養兒子
You don't tell me how to raise
my family.
我告訴你，用不著教訓我
怎麼撫養兒子
l told you not to tell me
how to raise my family.

你看見什麼了？
So what do you see?
我非常高興看到…  - 是的
我現在和聯合公司合作…
l'm very happy for you
that the deal...
Yes, l made a deal with Union.
- 我的兒子快樂而安心
- 恭喜你
My son is happy. He's safe....
Congratulations.
l'm taking care of him now,
so......Excellent.
- 我現在自己照顧他…
- 好極了
你看起來蠢極了，對嗎？提福
You look like a fool,
don't you, Tilford?
是的
Yes....Yes.
Yes, you do.
這就對了
請原諒，先生們
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Excuse him, gentlemen.
原諒他，先生們
我早就跟你說過了
l told you what l was going to do.
My son.
聽說你要離開這裡了
Mr. Sunday, l understand that
you're leaving our fair community.
是的，我要出去傳道了
Yes, l'm going on a mission....
Where you going?
你要去哪？
Oildale, Taft, and then on to
Bakersfield.
我想跟你說
Well, l want you to know...
Three quarters of an hour.
你在這邊的使命完成的很好

Thank you. You will be in my
prayers....l thank you very much.

''The woman saith unto him,
'Sir, give me this water
'''and l shall thirst not,
neither come hither to draw.'''
Come in, come in.
進來，進來
我們能單獨談談嗎？
Can we be alone?
這是我親密的合作夥伴
This is my closest associate.
He hears everything.
我們之間沒有秘密
我更想和你單獨說話
l'd prefer to speak to you
in private....You can't speak.
既然你不能說話
你就用手比劃
So why don't you flap your
hands about
and have what'shisname
tell me where you've been.
告訴我你這些日子都去哪了
你還以為我不知道嗎？
Or do you think l don't know?
This is hard for me to say.
我只能說很抱歉
l'll tell you first,
l love you very much.
但我想要告訴你，我非常愛你
l've learned to love what
l do because of you.
從你那裡
我學會了熱愛自己的事業

我要離開這裡了
去墨西哥
l'm going to Mexico.
l'm taking Mary,
and l'm going to Mexico.
帶著瑪莉去墨西哥
我喜歡在野外工作
l miss working outside.
我想念那些土地
l miss the fields.
再需要一些時間
lt'll only be for a time,
我就能成立自己的鑽井隊
for me to do my own drilling
and start my own company.
建立我自己的公司
lt's time to make a change.
是時候我要改變一下了
This makes you my competitor.
這樣你就成了我的競爭對手了
不，不是那樣的
No. No, it's not like that....
lt is like that, boy.
就是這樣，兒子
Your own company, huh?
- 你自己的公司？
- 是的
That's right.
ln Mexico?
在墨西哥
Yes.
是的
你把事情弄的這麼複雜
You are making such a misstep.
So, what are you doing?
你想要幹什麼
我知道在很多方面我們有分歧
l know you and l have disagreed
over many things.
我更願意把你當做我的父親
而不是合夥人
l'd rather keep you as my
father than my partner.
那就說出來！
Then say it.
你有話要對我說
就說出來讓我聽
lf you've got something to
say to me, then say it.
l'd like to hear you speak
instead of your little dog.
你來說，別讓你的傀儡狗
代你說話
l'm going to Mexico with my wife.
我要帶著我的妻子去墨西哥
我要離開你了
l'm going away from you.
That wasn't so hard, was it?
說出來沒那麼困難，對嗎？
你現在所做的一切
是要殺死我們兩個
Killing us with what you're doing.
你抹殺了在我心中
好兒子的形象
You're killing my image
of you as my son.
You are stubborn. You won't listen.
你太固執了
聽不進去別人的話
你不是我的兒子
You're not my son.
請別這樣說
Please don't say that.
l know you don't mean it.
我知道你不是這個意思
lt's the truth. You're not my son.
You never have been.
這是事實，你不是我的兒子
從來都不是，你是個孤兒
You're an orphan!
你有沒有聽說過這個字？
Did you ever hear that word?
告訴他，我說的話
Tell him what l said.
You operated here today like one.
你今天到這裡宣告自己要獨立
我早該預料到這一天
l should have seen this coming.
我應該知道，這麼多年來
l should have known that,
under this all, these past years
你暗自積累著對我的憎恨
一點一點的
you've been building new hate
for me, piece by piece.
我甚至不知道你是誰
你身上沒有一滴血液是我的…
l don't even know who you are
because you have none of me in you.
You're someone else's.
你是別人的兒子
你的憤怒，你的怨恨
還有對我的冷淡態度…
This anger. Your maliciousness.
Backwards dealings with me.
You're an orphan from a basket
in the middle of the desert.
你是一個身處沙漠中
裝在籃子裡的孤兒…
And l took you for no other
reason than
我把你撿來，不過是買地時
有個可愛的臉蛋在身旁
l needed a sweet face to
buy land.
你聽見了嗎？
Did you get that?
So now you know.
現在你知道真相了
看著我
Look at me! You're lower
than a bastard.
你比雜種還要低賤
You have none of me in you.
你身上沒有一滴血液是我的
不過是個籃子裡裝的賤種罷了
You're just a bastard from a basket.
l thank God l have none of
you in me.
感謝上帝
我終於瞭解你的本質了
Not my son. Just a little
piece of competition.
你不是我的兒子
只是個渺小的對手
籃子裡裝的雜種
Bastard from a basket.
籃子裡裝的雜種
Bastard from a basket!
You're a bastard from a basket!
你是個籃子裡裝的雜種！
Get up, Mr. Daniel.

Brother Daniel, it's Eli.
丹尼爾兄弟，我是伊萊
Yes, it is. Yes, it is.

l'll make us a drink.
你的家可真華麗
Your home is a miracle.

His word far and wide.

haven't we?
我們經歷過高潮與低谷
對嗎？
你現在正經歷低谷？伊萊

消息:
But l do come with some sad news.
Perhaps you remember Mr. Bandy?
你還記得班迪先生嗎？
Mr. Bandy has passed on
to the Lord.

to be in movies.
他渴望去好萊塢當一名演員
He is very goodlooking.

丹尼爾
Daniel, l'm asking if you'd
like to have business
我在詢問你是否願意
with the Church of the
Third Revelation
和我們第三啟示教會一起

鑽井取油
l'm offering you to drill
我邀請你在這片從未開發的
金色波士頓地區
on one of the great undeveloped
fields of Little Boston.
一起鑽井取油！
我很高興與你合作
l'd be happy to work with
you....You would?
Yes, yes, of course.
That's wonderful.
是的，當然，好極了
But there is one
condition for this work.
但是要答應你，我有個條件
All right.
請講
我要你親口告訴我
你是個冒牌先知
l'd like you to tell me that
you are a false prophet.
我要你親口告訴我
l'd like you to tell me that you
are, and have been a false prophet.
你是…而且一直是…
一個冒牌先知
And that God is a superstition.
所謂的上帝也不過是迷信
但這是謊言
But that's a lie.
這是謊言，我說不出口
lt's a lie. l cannot say it.
什麼時候能開始鑽井開工？
When can we begin to drill?...
Very soon.
非常快
How long will it take to
bring in the well?
要多久就可以賺錢呢？
lt shouldn't take long.
要不了多久
我要十萬美金做為簽約金
l would like a $100,000
signing bonus,
plus the five that is owed
to me with interest.
除此之外，再加五千美金
你欠我的，算上利息
That's only fair.
很公平
我是一個冒牌先知
上帝是迷信的產物
l am a false prophet,
and God is a superstition.
lf that's what you believe,
then l will say it.
如果你這樣想，我就這樣說
拿出讓人信服的語氣
Say it like you mean it....
Daniel.

我是一個冒牌先知
上帝是迷信的產物
God is a superstition....

and you have a full congregation, so...

上帝是迷信的產物！

那些地區已經開採過了
Those areas have been drilled.
什麼？
What?
那些地區已經開採過了
Those areas,
they've been drilled.
不，從來沒有
No, they haven't....
Yes, it's...
是的，開採過了
lt's called drainage, Eli.
這就像抽水系統，伊萊
我抽取了周圍土地裡的石油
See, l own everything around it, so,
of course, l get what's underneath it.
所以那片土地下面的
早就抽乾了
But there are no derricks there.
但是那裡連採油平臺都沒有
我說的是班迪的土地
你明白嗎？
This is the Bandy tract.
Do you understand?
該我問 "你明白了嗎"？伊萊
Do you understand, Eli?
這才是重點，你明白了嗎？
That's more to the point.
Do you understand?
我喝了你的水
l drink your water.
l drink it up every day.
全部喝光了
每一天，我都在班迪的
土地下吸取肥油
l drink the blood of Lamb
from Bandy's tract.
你可以坐下了
You can sit down again.
Daniel.
哦，丹尼爾
Daniel.
Please.
拜託了
l am in desperate times....
l know.
- 我已經走投無路了
- 我知道
- 我需要一個朋友
- 是的，你當然需要
l need a friend....Yes.
Of course, you do.
l've sinned.
我犯了罪
需要幫助，我是罪人…
l need help. l'm a sinner.
l've let the devil grab hold
of me in ways l never imagined.
我從來沒有想到
會被魔鬼攫取了靈魂
l'm so full of sin.
我充滿了罪惡
The Lord sometimes challenges
us, doesn't He, Eli?
上帝有時會考驗我們，對嗎？
Yes, He does, Daniel....
Yes, He does.
是的…
- 丹尼爾，他考驗了我！
- 是的他考驗了你！
Yes, He does!
Yes, He does!
He's completely failed to alert me
to the recent panic in our economy.
最近的一次經濟危機
他一點都沒提醒我…
And this......Oh, dear.
而且這筆錢
l must have this, Daniel. l must,
l must, l must have this.
我需要這筆錢，丹尼爾
我必須有這筆錢
投資陷入了黑洞
My investments have...
Daniel, l won't bore you,
丹尼爾，我想再煩你，但是…
but if l could grab the Lord's
hand for help l would,
如果可以抓住上帝的手
祈求幫助，我會的
but He does these things
all the time.
但他總是這樣
在我們焦急等待的時候
卻故做神秘
These mysteries that He presents,
and while we wait...
我們一直等待他的指示
While we wait for His word!
Because you're not the chosen
brother, Eli.
你不是上帝選擇鍾愛的子民
伊萊
Because you're not the
chosen brother, Eli.
'Twas Paul who was chosen.
保羅才是上帝選中的人
保羅找到我，讓我到這裡來
你只是個假貨
He found me and told me
about your land.
You're just a fool.
Why are you talking about Paul?
- 你為什麼要說起保羅？
- 我做了你兄弟做不了的事情
l did what your brother couldn't.
Don't say this to me.
我擊潰了你，打敗了你
l broke you and l beat you.
lt was Paul told me about you.
是保羅…
告訴我你是誰，他才是先知
他才是智者
He's the prophet.
He's the smart one.
He knew what was there
他知道地下埋藏的財富
他找到我，讓我把財富挖出
and he found me to take it
out of the ground.
Know what the funny thing is?
Listen, listen.
你知道最有趣的是什麼？
聽好…
我給了他一萬美金
現金兌現，就是這樣
l paid him $10,000 cash in
hand. Just like that.
他現在有了一家自己的公司
He has his own company now.
Prosperous little business.
繁榮的小商戶，三口油井
每週泵出五千美金
Three wells producing,
$5,000 a week.
別哭了，你這個哭膿包
別再跟我瞎扯了
Stop crying, you sniveling ass.
Stop your nonsense.
你只是保羅出生後的
一團污穢，伊萊
You're just the afterbirth,
Eli....No.
That slithered out
on your mother's filth.
是你母親產後的那團
粘稠的污穢
No.
They should've put you in a
glass jar on the mantelpiece.
他們應該把你醃在玻璃瓶裡
放在壁爐架上觀賞
當保羅吮吸母親的乳汁時
你在哪啊？
Where were you when Paul was
suckling at his mother's teat?
Where were you?
你在哪？
誰在照顧你，可憐的伊萊？
被遺棄的孩子
Who was nursing you, poor Eli?
One of Bandy's sows?
那片土地已經貧瘠了
你無利可圖
That land has been had.
Nothing you can do about it.
lt's gone.
- 沒了，已經發生了，你輸了
請你租下這塊土地吧，丹尼爾
lf you would just take this
lease......You lose.
Drainage!
抽水系統！抽水系統
伊萊！你這孩子…
Drainage, Eli, you boy.
Drained dry. l'm so sorry.
已經抽乾了，很抱歉
lf you have a milkshake
如果你有一杯奶昔
我也有一杯
and l have a milkshake,
我有一根吸管，就在那
一根吸管，看好了
and l have a straw, there it is.
That's the straw, you see?
Watch it.
我的吸管穿過整間房子
Now my straw reaches across
the room
開始吸你杯子裡的奶昔
and starts to drink your milkshake.
l drink your milkshake!
我開始喝你的奶昔！
喝光了！
l drink it up!...Don't bully
me, Daniel.
別欺負我，丹尼爾
你以為你可笑的歌曲和舞蹈
Did you think your song and dance and
your superstition would help you, Eli?
還有上帝會幫助你，伊萊？
l am the Third Revelation.
l am who the Lord has chosen.
我才是神諭的第三啟示！
我才是上帝鍾愛的子民！
Daniel!...Because l'm smarter
than you!
因為我比你智慧
l'm older!
比你有閱歷…

我們是老朋友了，丹尼爾！
l'm not a false prophet......
Help me! Help me!
...you sniveling boy!
我才是真正的先知！
你這個鼻涕蟲
l am the Third Revelation!

l told you l would eat you up!
We're brothers! We're brothers!
我們是兄弟！我們親如兄弟！
Daniel, please forgive me.
l beg you.
丹尼爾，饒了我，求你了
That's it. That's it.
丹尼爾先生？
Mr. Daniel?
l'm finished.
已經結束了
