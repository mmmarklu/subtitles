在西部有一個傢伙
Out west there was this fella,
我正要說關於他的故事
fella I want to tell you about,
他叫傑弗裡.勒保斯基
fella by the name
of Jeff Lebowski...
至少那是他親愛的
父母給他的
at least that's the handle
his parents gave him.
然而他卻不太喜歡
But he never had
much use for it himself.
這個勒保斯基
稱自己為「督爺」
This Lebowski,
he called himself the Dude.
「督爺」是在我家鄉裡
沒人會用的稱呼
Now, Dude, that's a name
no one would self... apply
where I come from.
然而關於這個
督爺的傳奇卻很多
There was a lot about the Dude
that didn't make sense to me,
雖然對我沒多大意義
他居住的地方也是
and a lot about
where he lived, likewise.
But then again,
但這也許是我覺得
那地方很有趣的原因
maybe that's why I found
the place so darn interesting.
They call Los Angeles
the City of Angels.
人們稱洛杉磯為天使之城
我不覺得那是完全正確的
I didn't find it
to be that exactly.
但那裡還是有一些好人的
But there are
some nice folks there.
'Course I can't
say I seen London,
因為我沒去過倫敦
也沒到過法國
and I never been to France,
也沒見過內衣皇后
and I ain't never seen
no queen in her damned undies.
But I'll tell you what,
但我告訴你
在瞭解洛杉磯之後
after seeing Los Angeles
並聽了我即將說的
故事之後
and this story
I'm about to unfold,
我會覺得任何事情
都有一點愚蠢
well, I guess I seen somethin'
every bit as stupefyin'
不管在什麼地方
說什麼語言
as you'd see
in any other places,
and in English, too.
那樣我可以
臉帶微笑地死去
So I can die
with a smile on my face
沒有那種被上天
欺騙的感覺
without feeling like
the good Lord gypped me.
我將要講述的
這個故事...
Now, this story
I'm about to unfold
發生在90年代早期
took place
back in the early 90s,
大概在與伊拉克
發生衝突的時候
about the time of our conflict
with Saddam and the Iraqis.
我提起這些是
因為一個男人...
I only mention it 'cause
sometimes there's a man...
I won't say a hero,
'cause what's a hero?
我不會說一個英雄
因為英雄是什麼呢?
那時候有一個男人...
But sometimes there's a man...
這裡說的就是督爺
and I'm talking
about the Dude here...
那個男人...
sometimes there's a man...
Well, he's the man
for his time and place.
他非常適應
自己所在的時代
找到自己適應的地方
He fits right in there,
and that's the Dude,
那就是在洛杉磯的督爺
in Los Angeles.
即使他是個懶惰的人...
And even if he's a lazy man,
督爺很可能是...
and the Dude was
most certainly that,
洛杉磯最懶的人
quite possibly the laziest
in Los Angeles county,
在世界懶人排行榜的
位置也一定很高
which would place him high
in the running
for laziest worldwide.
那時候有一個男人
But sometimes there's a man,
那時候有一個男人...
sometimes...
there's a man...
我的思想流斷開了
Wow, lost my train
of thought here.
不管怎樣
But... ah, hell.
我對他的介紹已經足夠了
I done introduced him enough.
一次集體的行動
'This will not stand.
這不會停止
'This will not stand,
this aggression against Kuwait.'
這不會停止
對科威特的侵略
錢在哪裡,勒保斯基?
Where's the money, Lebowski?
我要那些錢,勒保斯基
I want that money, Lebowski.
Bunny says you're good for it.
邦妮說你非常富有的
錢在哪裡,勒保斯基?
Where's the money, Lebowski?
錢在哪裡,勒保斯基?
Where's the money, Lebowski?
錢到底在哪裡,混蛋?!
Where's the fucking
money, shithead?
在...
It's down there somewhere.
Let me take another look.
就在這裡的,我找一下
Don't fuck with us!
別耍話語!
Your wife owes money
to Jackie Treehorn.
你老婆欠了
傑奇.特裡赫姆的錢
那就是說你欠了
傑奇.特裡赫姆
That means you owe
money to Jackie Treehorn.
即使是賴債
不還的人,勒保斯基
Ever thus
to deadbeats, Lebowski.
Don't do that...
不要...
別在地毯上啊
- Not on the rug, man.
- See?
看到了嗎,勒保斯基?
See what happens, Lebowski?
You see what happens?
看到了嗎?
沒人會叫我勒保斯基
Nobody calls me Lebowski.
You got the wrong man.
你們找錯人了.我是督爺
I'm the Dude, man.
你的名字是勒保斯基
Your name's Lebowski, Lebowski.
Your wife is Bunny.
你老婆叫邦妮
我老婆邦妮?
My... my wife... my wife, Bunny?
你看到我手指上
有結婚戒指嗎?
Do you see a wedding ring?
這地方像是
結了婚的人住的嗎?
Does this place
look like I'm married?
馬桶的坐板放起來了
The toilet seat's up, man.
What the fuck is this?
這是什麼?
顯然你不會打保齡
Obviously, you're not a golfer.
吳?
- Woo?
- Yeah?
怎麼了?
那傢伙不是百萬富翁嗎?
Isn't this guy supposed
to be a millionaire?
Fuck!
操!
你說呢?
- Yeah, what do you think?
- He looks like a fucking loser.
他樣子像個失敗者
起碼我有教養
Hey, at least I'm housebroken.
Fucking time wasted.
Thanks a lot, asshole.
浪費時間了
謝了,混蛋
片名:大保齡離奇綁案

I'm throwing rocks tonight.
Mark it, Dude.
我今晚手風很順啊
記分吧,督爺
那是很有價值的地毯
This was a valued rug.
This was a...
那是...
那和地板緊密地粘在一起
It really
tied the room together.
那是很有價值的...
So this was a valued...
什麼和地板緊密地
粘在一起,督爺?
- What tied the room together?
- My rug.
我的地毯
你剛才有聽督爺
講故事嗎,多尼?
- Were you listening, Donny?
- What?
什麼?
Were you listening
to the Dude's story?
你剛才有
聽督爺講故事嗎?
我剛在打保齡球啊
I was bowling.
那你就什麼
都不瞭解,多尼
You have no frame of reference,
like a child who wanders in...
你就像一個中途
出來打岔的...
Walter, what's the point?
沃爾特,你想說明什麼?
聽我說,督爺...
There's no reason...
here's my point, Dude...
沒有任何理由...
- there's no reason...
- Yeah, what's your point?
是啊,沃爾特
你想說明什麼?
- Huh?
- Walter, what is the point...
沃爾特,你想說明什麼
我們都知道這裡誰有困惑
We know who is at fault here.
你到底在說什麼鬼話?
What the fuck
are you talking about?
你...
No, what the fuck are you...
I'm not...
我...
We're talking about
unchecked aggression here.
我們在說
不速之客的侵犯,督爺
他到底在說什麼鬼話?
- What is he talking about?
- My rug.
我的地毯
Forget it,
you're out of your element.
算了,多尼.你少管了
沃爾特,那個中國人
在我地毯上撒尿
The Chinaman who peed on my rug,
I can't go give him a bill.
但我不能給他清潔帳單啊
你到底在說什麼?
So what the fuck
are you talking about?
你到底在說什麼?
我們討論的不是
那個中國人,督爺
The Chinaman
is not the issue here.
我在說要劃清界限,督爺
I'm talking about
drawing a line in the sand.
如果越過了就要...
Across this line, you do not...
還有,督爺
叫他中國人不太合適
Also, Dude, "Chinaman" is not
the preferred nomenclature.
應該叫美籍亞洲人
"Asian... American," please.
沃爾特,不是
那些修鐵路的人
This isn't a guy who built
the railroads here...
那傢伙...
你在說什麼啊
- What the fuck...
- He peed on my rug.
沃爾特,他在我的
地毯上撒尿
- He peed on the Dude's rug.
- You're out of your element!
他在督爺的地毯上撒尿
多尼,你別管了
督爺,那中國人不是要點
Dude, the Chinaman
is not the issue here.
那誰...
- So, who... who...
- Jeff Lebowski.
傑弗裡.勒保斯基
另一個傑弗裡.勒保斯基
The other Jeffrey Lebowski,
the millionaire.
百萬富翁
那真的很有意思
That's fucking interesting, man.
That's fucking interesting.
他有財有勢
Plus, he has the wealth
and the resources...
所以沒有任何理由...
so there's no reason,
no fucking reason
why his wife
should go out, owe money,
他老婆會出來玩
並欠了債
and then they pee
on your fucking rug!
然後那些人來你家
在你的地毯上撒尿!
- Am I wrong?
- No.
-我說錯了嗎?-不
- Am I wrong?
- But...
但是...
OK, then.
那麼...
那地毯和地板真的
緊密地粘在一起,對吧?
That rug really tied
the room together, did it not?
- Fuckin' A!
- And he peed on it.
當然了!
那個傢伙還在上面撒尿
Donny, please.
多尼
我能找到那個
該死的勒保斯基
I could find this
fucking Lebowski guy.
他叫勒保斯基?
His name is Lebowski?
That's your name, Dude.
那是你的姓氏啊,督爺
他應該賠償我的地毯
He should compensate me
for the fucking rug.
他老婆出來玩,到處欠債
His wife owes money,
and they pee on my rug?
還讓人在我的
地毯上撒尿?
他們在你的地毯上撒尿
- They pee on your fucking rug.
- They peed on my fucking rug.
沒錯
是啊,督爺
That's right, Dude.
They peed on your fucking rug.
他們在你的地毯上撒尿
這裡就是書房
This is the study.
The various commendations...
有各種各樣的獎狀...
「傑弗裡.勒保斯基」
Jeffrey Lebowski.
榮譽學位等等
- Honorary degrees, etcetera.
- Very impressive.
非常厲害
Oh, please feel free
to inspect them.
請隨便查看
- Oh, I'm not really that...
- Oh, please, please.
我不是那麼...
有請
那是帕薩裡那城的鑰匙
That is the key
to the city of Pasadena,
兩年前勒保斯基先生
成為那裡的傑出市民
which Mr Lebowski received in
recognition of various civic...
那是洛杉磯商會的
商業成就獎
Oh, that's the Los Angeles
Chamber of Commerce
Business Achiever Award,
並不是每年都頒發的
which is... not
necessarily given every year.
那是他和南茜
(列根夫人)的合照?
Hey, is this, uh,
is this him with Nancy?
是的,那就是勒保斯基
先生和第一夫人...
Yes, indeed, that is Mr Lebowski
with the First Lady...
在左邊的就是
勒保斯基?
That's Lebowski
on the left there?
當然了.勒保斯基
先生就在左邊
Of course.
Mr Lebowski on the left...
他是個跛子
He's a cripple... you know,
a... handicapped guy?
他是殘疾人?
勒保斯基先生
是傷殘人士
Mr Lebowski is disabled, yes.
This picture was taken
那是在列根
任職總統時拍的照片
when Mrs Reagan was
First Lady of the nation.
並不是加州州長那時候
- Yes, yes. Not of California.
- Pope John.
約翰教皇
他曾經和總統私下會面
He met privately
with the president,
但不幸的是
當時沒足夠的時間拍照
but there was no time
for a photo opportunity.
南茜是個不錯的女人
- Nancy's pretty good.
- Wonderful woman!
是啊,非常好
These are...
這些是...
勒保斯基先生的子女
Those are Mr Lebowski's
children, so to speak.
同父異母的?
Different mothers?
Racially, pretty cool.
不同種族的啊
他們並非他的子女
They're not literally
his children.
他們是勒保斯基
先生的義子女
They're the Little
Lebowski Urban Achievers,
inner... city children of promise
他們缺乏接受
高等教育的條件
but without the means
for a higher education.
於是勒保斯基先生
資助他們上大學
Mr Lebowski is committed
to sending them to college.
Excuse me. Thank you, thank you.
不好意思
謝謝
Far out. Think he's
got room for one more?
很好啊
還有多一個位子嗎?
One, uh... Oh!
一個...
You never went to college.
Please, don't touch that.
你還沒上過大學
請不要觸摸它
我上過的,但是...
Yeah, I did, but I spent
most of my time...
我大部分時間用在
不同的建築裡面
occupying various
administration buildings,
抽泰國煙...
smoking a lot of Thai stick,
闖進預備軍官訓練團
breaking into the R.O.T.C.
And bowling.
還有打保齡
告訴你吧,布蘭特
To tell you the truth,
I don't remember much.
那些很多我都忘記了
先生,你我都叫勒保斯基
OK, sir, you're a Lebowski,
I'm a Lebowski,
that's terrific.
太巧了
但我現在很忙
我想你也應該是
But I'm very busy,
as I imagine you are.
What can I do for you, sir?
我能幫你什麼嗎?
Well, sir, it's this rug I have,
先生...
我有一塊地毯
和地板粘在一起的
it really tied
the room together...
你在電話上告訴布蘭特
他也告訴了我
You told Brandt, he told me.
Where do I fit in?
這與我有什麼關係?
Well, they were
looking for you, these guys.
那兩個男人要找的是你
I'll say it again.
我再說一次,這些
布蘭特已經告訴我了
You told Brandt
on the phone, he told me.
我知道發生了什麼事情
I know what happened. Yes?
So you know that they were
trying to piss on your rug?
你知道他們想在
我的地毯上撒尿?
Did I urinate on your rug?
我在那地毯上撒尿了嗎?
你的意思是說
你本人做了?
Did you personally
come and pee on my rug?
你會說英語嗎?
Hello! Do you speak English?
Parla usted ingles?
你會說英語嗎?
我再問一次,我在
那地毯上撒尿了嗎?
I'll ask you again.
Did I urinate on your rug?
沒有,是那個叫吳的人做的
No, like I said,
Woo peed on my rug.
我只想明白這個
I want to understand this, sir.
如果誰的地毯被人撒尿了
Every time a rug is
micturated upon in this city,
我也要賠償嗎?
I have to compensate...
Come on, man, I'm not
trying to scam anybody here.
我不是想欺詐這裡的人
我只是...
I... I was just...
你想找一些救濟品
You're just looking for
a handout like every other...
就像其他的人...
Are you employed, Mr Lebowski?
你有工作嗎
勒保斯基先生?
Wait, let me
explain something to you.
等一等,讓我解釋一下
我不是勒保斯基
先生.你才是
I am not Mr Lebowski.
You're Mr Lebowski.
我是督爺
I'm the Dude.
So that's what you call me,
別人都這樣叫我
you know, uh, that
or, uh, his Dudeness,
就叫我督爺吧
or Duder, or, you
know, uh, el Duderino,
簡短一些就這樣
if you're not into
the whole brevity thing.
你有工作嗎,先生?
- Are you employed, sir?
- Employed?
工作?
你不會穿成
這樣去工作吧?
You don't look for a job
dressed like that on a weekday?
今天星期幾了?
Is this a... What day is this?
Well, I do work, sir.
So if you don't mind...
我有工作的,先生
如果你不介意
No, I do mind. The Dude minds.
我介意的
督爺介意
This will not stand, you know.
這不會停止
這種侵犯不會停止
This aggression
will not stand, man.
你妻子欠了...
- I mean, your wife owes...
- My wife is not the issue!
我妻子不是討論的要點!
我希望我妻子總有一天
學會靠定量供給生活
I hope that my wife will learn
to live on her ample allowance.
那是足夠的
如果她覺得不夠
If not, that's
her problem, not mine,
就是她的問題
不是我的問題
just as the rug is your problem,
就像那地毯
是你的問題一樣
每個遊民的命運
也是他自己的責任
just as every bum's lot in life
is his own responsibility,
不管他選擇誰去埋怨
regardless of who
he chooses to blame.
我失去了雙腿
也不會埋怨誰
I didn't blame anyone
for the loss of my legs.
我在韓戰的時候失去的
Some Chinaman
took them from me in Korea.
但我後來也成功了
But I went out
and achieved anyway.
我不能解決你的問題,先生
I cannot solve your problems,
sir, only you can.
只有你可以
- Oh, fuck it.
- "Oh, fuck it."
他媽的
他媽的
那是你對所有事情的回答
Yes, that's your answer
to everything.
紋在前額上吧
Tattoo it on your forehead.
你的變革結束了
勒保斯基先生!
Your revolution
is over, Mr Lebowski!
哀悼!
Condolences! The bums lost!
游手好閒的人!
我給你的建議是
像你父母那樣!
My advice to you
is to do what your parents did!
找份工作吧!
Get a job, sir!
The bums will always lose!
Do you hear me, Lebowski?
游手好閒的總是失敗者!
你聽到嗎,勒保斯基?!
游手好閒的總是失敗者!
The bums...
你的會見怎樣了
勒保斯基先生?
How was your meeting,
Mr Lebowski?
老先生說我可以拿走
這裡任何一塊地毯
OK. The old man told me
to take any rug in the house.
Well, enjoy, and perhaps
we'll see you again, Dude.
非常好
也許我們會再見的,督爺
是啊,如果我們是鄰居的話
Sure, if I'm in
the neighbourhood, you know,
對了...
and, um...
I need to use the john.
我要上洗手間
Blow on them.
吹吧
吹吧
Go ahead, blow.
You want me to blow
on your toes?
你要我對你的腳趾吹氣?
Uh... huh. I can't blow that far.
我吹不了那麼遠啊
Are you sure he won't mind?
你肯定他不會介意嗎?
他真的什麼也不介意
He doesn't care about anything.
He's a nihilist.
他是一個虛無主義者
那一定令人很疲憊
Oh, that must be exhausting.
你沒有吹啊
You're not blowing.
他是我們的客人
勒保斯基太太
He has to be getting along,
Mrs Lebowski.
你就是邦妮
Oh, you're Bunny.
如果讓我為你口交
我給你1千塊
I'll suck your cock for $1,000.
Wonderful woman.
令人驚奇的女人
我們都很喜歡她
We're very fond of her.
Very free... spirited.
非常自由的
布蘭特不能觀看
否則他就要給1百
Brandt can't watch,
or he has to pay 100.
太不可思議了
That's marvellous.
我要去找一個提款機
I'm just gonna
go find a cash machine.
Whoo! Slamming them tonight!
今晚我手風很順
你們倒霉了
You guys are dead in the water.
走著瞧吧,多尼!
All right! Way to go, Donny!
有志者事竟成
If you will it, it is no dream.
你遲到20分鐘了,老兄
You're 20 minutes late, man.
What the fuck is that?
那是什麼鬼東西?
Theodore Herzel.
提奧多爾.何素的著作
「猶太人的國家」
督爺,有志者事竟成
The state of Israel. If you
will it, Dude, it is no dream.
你在說什麼鬼話?
The carrier. What's
in the fucking carrier?
我問的是籠子裡面有什麼
那是辛迪雅的狗
Oh, Cynthia's dog.
I think it's a Pomeranian.
應該是波美拉尼亞狗
我不能把它留在家裡
I can't leave him,
he eats the furniture.
不然它會吃傢俱
辛迪雅和馬迪去
夏威夷的時候我要看著它
I'm watching it
while they're in Hawaii.
- You brought it bowling?
- "Brought it bowling"?
你帶著那討厭的
狗來打保齡?
帶來打保齡?
I didn't rent it shoes,
I'm not buying it a beer,
我沒給它租鞋子啊
我不會給它買啤酒
他不能替代你的位置,督爺
he's not taking your turn, Dude.
如果我那該死的前妻
在和他男友去玩的時候
If my ex... wife asked me
to take care of her dog
叫我幫她看著小狗
while she and her boyfriend
went to Honolulu,
我一定會叫她吃自己
為什麼不能帶上飛機?
I'd tell her to fuck herself.
督爺,首先你沒有前妻
Dude, you don't have an ex,
其次,這是一隻貴婦狗
and this is a fucking show dog
with fucking papers.
不能帶上飛機
它會發脾氣的
You can't board it. It gets
upset. Its hair falls out.
毛也會掉下來
沃爾特...
該死的貴婦狗
越線了!
Over the line!
Sorry, you were over the line.
That's a foul.
不好意思,斯莫奇
你的腳越線了
那是犯規的
胡說.記一個8分,督爺
Bullshit. Mark it 8, Dude.
記零分,下一輪
Excuse me, mark it zero.
Next frame.
胡說,沃爾特.
記一個8分,督爺
Bullshit, Walter.
Mark it 8, Dude.
斯莫奇,這裡不是
越南,現在是打保齡
This is not 'Nam, this
is bowling. There are rules.
要守規矩
沃爾特,只是...
Hey, Walter, come on,
it's Smokey.
他是斯莫奇
他的腳趾越了線那麼一點
His toe slipped over.
It's just a game.
只是遊戲而已
這是聯盟比賽.決定
誰進入下一次巡迴賽
It determines who enters
the round... robin. Am I wrong?
我有錯嗎?
- Yeah, but...
- Am I wrong?
是的,但我沒有...
我錯了嗎?
Yeah, but I wasn't over.
沒錯,但我沒越線
給我記分表,督爺
Give me the marker, Dude.
I'm marking an 8.
我要記一個8分
斯莫奇
Smokey, my friend,
you're entering a world of pain.
你在進入一個痛苦的世界
- Walter...
- You mark that frame an 8,
沃爾特
記錄一個8分
你在進入一個痛苦的世界
you're entering a world of pain.
我不會...
- I'm not...
- A world of pain.
一個痛苦的世界
督爺,這是你的搭檔
Look, Dude,
this is your partner.
這個世界變瘋狂了嗎?!
Has the world gone crazy?
這裡只有我在乎規則嗎?
Am I the only one
who cares about the rules?
Mark it zero!
記零分!
他們在叫警察,夥計
- They're calling the cops.
- Mark it zero!
拿開那東西
記零分!
沃爾特,拿開那東西
- Put the piece away.
- Walter...
沃爾特...
你以為我在開玩笑嗎?
You think I'm fucking around?
Mark it zero!
記零分!
好了,一個零分
All right, it's fucking zero.
你高興了嗎,瘋子?
You happy, you crazy fuck?
這是聯盟比賽
It's a league game, Smoke.
你不能這樣做
You can't do that, man.
這些人和我一樣
是和平主義者
These guys are like me.
They're pacifists.
斯莫奇是一個
拒絕兵役的人
Smokey was
a conscientious objector.
督爺,你知道我曾經
是和平主義者
I myself dabbled in pacifism,
not in 'Nam, of course.
當然不是在越南的時候
你也知道他有情緒問題
You know he's got
emotional problems.
超過了和平主義?
You mean, beyond pacifism?
他非常脆弱
He's fragile, very fragile.
我還不知道呢
I did not know that.
Well, it's all
water under the bridge,
覆水難收
我們一定要進入
下一次巡迴賽
and we do enter
the next round... robin.
我有錯嗎?
- Am I wrong?
- No, you're not wrong.
不,你沒錯
我有錯嗎?
- Am I wrong?
- No, you're just an asshole!
你沒錯,沃爾特
你只是個混蛋!
OK. We play Quintana
and O'Brien next week.
那好吧
我們下周就要對
昆提那和奧布賴恩
他們應該很容易對付
They should be pushovers.
Man, will you just...
你能不能...
別緊張,夥計
Just take it easy, man.
那是你對所有
問題的回答,督爺
That's your answer
for everything, Dude.
我要指出一點
Look at our current situation
with that camelfucker in Iraq.
看看現在伊拉克的情況
和平主義不是
用來隱藏的
Pacifism is not
something to hide behind.
別緊張,夥計
Just take it easy, man.
I'm perfectly calm, Dude.
我非常冷靜,督爺
揮舞著手槍也算是嗎?
- Waving the fucking gun around?
- Calmer than you are.
比你更冷靜
Just take it easy!
你別那麼衝動好嗎?
比你更冷靜
Calmer than you are.
督爺,這是斯莫奇
'Dude, this is Smokey.
我不想在這件
事情上搞僵了
'I don't want to
be a hard... on about this.
我知道那不是你的錯
'I know it wasn't your fault,
但我覺得應該告訴你
'but Gilbert and I
will submit this to the league
吉爾伯特和我會將
這個遞交給聯盟
並要求他們取消
這一輪的賽事
'and ask them
to set aside the round,
也許會被我們沒收

我想只是一個警告
'So, like I say,

此行為違反了
聯盟比賽的規則...
督爺

你好啊,蒙迪
督爺,我終於參加了比賽
Dude, I... I finally got...

我將表演5人跳舞
I'm performing my dance quintet,

週二晚上在傑克森

我們有個壞消息
We've had terrible news.
Mr Lebowski's in seclusion.
勒保斯基先生
將自己隔離在西翼
Mr Lebowski.
勒保斯基先生
Funny...
真有意思...
我可以回顧我一生的成就
I can look back
on a life of achievement,
challenges met,
迎接過無數挑戰
打敗過無數對手
competitors bested,
obstacles overcome.
克服過無數障礙
我比大多數男人
有更多的成就
I've accomplished more
than most men
而且沒有使用到雙腳
and without the use of my legs.
What...
男人是什麼做成的
勒保斯基先生?
What makes a man, Mr Lebowski?
Dude.
督爺
我不知道,先生
I... I don't know, sir.
是準備好做正確的事情嗎?
Is it being prepared
to do the right thing?
Whatever the cost?
不管任何代價?
那是做男人原料嗎?
Isn't that what makes a man?
還要有一對睪丸
Sure, that
and a pair of testicles.
你在開玩笑
You're joking. But...
但是...
Perhaps you're right.
也許你是對的
You mind if I do a "J"?
介意我抽煙嗎?
邦妮...
Bunny...
Excuse me?
什麼?
Bunny Lebowski,
邦妮.勒保斯基
她是我生命中的光亮
she is the light of my life.
你對我流淚感到驚訝嗎?
Are you surprised
at my tears, sir?
Fuckin' A.
當然了
堅強的男人也會流淚
Strong men also cry.
堅強的男人也會流淚
Strong men also cry.
I received this fax
this morning.
今天早上我收到這個傳真
As you can see,
你可以看到
這是要求贖金的
it is a ransom note.
"We have Bunnie."
「邦妮在我們手上」
寫自一些不敢
公平較量的人之手
Sent by men who can't achieve
on a level field of play.
「籌集一百萬美金」
"Gather one million dollars
「沒有記錄的
不連續的20元紙幣」
in unmarked,
non... consecutive twenties."
- Weaklings!
- "Await instructions."
懦夫
「等待指示」
遊民!
「這不是開玩笑的」
- Bums!
- "No funny stuff."
無賴
- Bummer.
- Huh?
無賴
This is a bummer, man.
那是個無賴
That's, uh, that's a bummer.
布蘭特會給你講解細節
Brandt will
fill you in on the details.
勒保斯基先生將給
信使一份大方的報酬
Mr Lebowski will make you
a generous offer
to act as courier once we get
instructions for the money.
現在我們只等他們的指示
為什麼找我?
Why me, man?
他相信那些
污染你地毯的人...
He believes the culprits
might be the people
和綁架的歹徒是一夥的
who, uh... soiled your rug,
而你在此事中的
位置很特別
and you're in a unique position
to confirm or disconfirm this.
他認為是那撒尿的
傢伙幹的?
He thinks
the carpet... pissers did this?
督爺,我們就是不知道
Well, Dude, we just don't know.
「耶穌」
該死的昆提那
Fucking Quintana.
那傢伙很棒哦
That creep can roll, man.
沒錯,但他是個
變態,督爺
Yeah, but he's a pervert, Dude.
Yeah.
是啊
他是個有性侵犯
案底的傢伙
No. He's a sex offender
with a record.
He did six months for exposing
himself to an 8... year... old.
在齊諾監獄坐了6個月
因為他對一個
8歲女孩露體
他搬去好萊塢之後
When he moved to Hollywood,
he had to go door... to... door
要挨家挨戶地告訴
別人他是個雞姦者
to tell everyone
he was a pederast.
雞姦者是什麼,沃爾特?
What's a pederast, Walter?
閉嘴,多尼
Shut the fuck up, Donny.
他們給你多少錢?
- So... How much they give you?
- 20 grand, man.
兩萬
而且我還能得到那地毯
- And I get to keep the rug.
- Just for making a hand... off?
就是那舉手之勞?
是啊,他們還給了
督爺一個傳呼機
Yeah. They gave Dude a beeper.
如果那些人傳呼...
- So whenever they call...
- What if it's during a game?
如果正在打聯盟比賽呢?
我告訴過他們如果
在聯盟比賽當中...
- If it's during league play...
- What's during league play?
什麼聯盟比賽?
生活不會遷就你的
Life doesn't stop and start
at your convenience,
你這個沒用的傢伙
- you piece of shit.
- What's wrong with Walter?
我想...
沃爾特怎麼了,督爺?
我想那些是快錢
I figure it's easy money.
It's harmless.
都是無害的
她有可能叫人綁架自己
- She probably did it herself.
- What do you mean, Dude?
什麼意思,督爺?
在地毯上撒尿的人
不會做那些事情
Rug pee... ers didn't do this.
Look at it.
看看
A young trophy wife
marries this guy for his money.
一個年輕女子為了錢嫁人
她覺得他沒給她足夠的錢
She figures
he isn't giving her enough.
而她在城裡欠了一身債
You know, she owes money.
那個該死的婊子
- That fuckin'... bitch.
- It's all goddamn fake, man.
這是個騙局
像列寧說的那樣
It's like Lenin said.
找一個可以獲得好處的人
You look for the person
who will benefit,
你知道...
- and, uh, you know...
- I am the walrus?
我是個胖矮子?
你會...
You know, you'll, uh...
你知道我想說什麼的
- You know what I'm saying.
- I am the walrus.
我是個胖矮子
那該死的婊子!
That fuckin' bitch!
是啊
我是個胖矮子
- I am the walrus.
- Shut the fuck up, Donny!
閉嘴,多尼!
弗拉基米爾
伊裡奇.列寧!
V.I. Lenin.
Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov!
What the fuck
is he talking about?
他在說什麼鬼話?
剛才的事讓他發瘋了
Fucking exactly what happened.
That makes me sick.
你在乎什麼,沃爾特?
- What do you care, Walter?
- Those rich fucks.
那些該死的有錢人
這件該死的事情
This whole fuckin' thing.
我沒有看著
朋友在戰場死去
I didn't watch my buddies die
face... down in the mud
那個該死的賤人
so that this fucking strumpet,
this fucking whore...
妓女...
我不覺得這與
越南有什麼聯繫
I don't see
any connection with Vietnam.
有文字上的聯繫
No literal connection.
不,沃爾特,沒有任何聯繫
Face it, there's no
connection. Your roll.
到你了
但我要說的是
- But my point is...
- Your roll.
到你了
我要說的是...
你準備好被打敗了嗎?
Are you ready to be fucked?
我知道你們進了半決賽
I see you roll your way
into the semis.
Dios mio, man.
我的天啊
裡安和我會將你們幹掉的
Liam and me,
we're gonna fuck you up.
Yeah? Well... you know,
that's just like, uh...
是嗎?
那就像是...
你的意見,夥計
your opinion, man.
我告訴你
Let me tell you
something, pendejo,
如果你把我們惹惱了
you pull any crazy shit with us,
你的肉就會飛到球道上
you flash a piece out
on the lanes,
我想對著你的屁股...
I'll take it
and stick it up your ass
然後扣動扳機
and pull the fuckin' trigger
till it goes click.
直到沒子彈為止
- Jesus.
- You said it, man.
耶穌啊(天啊)
你說了,夥計
沒人可以鬥得過耶穌
Nobody fucks with the Jesus.
8... year... olds, Dude.
8歲的小孩,督爺
Ohh, man.
他們80分鐘前呼叫的
They called 80 minutes ago.
他們想讓你帶錢去
Take the money,
drive north on the 405.
開車到405公路北面.40分鐘
後會有人打電話給你指示
They will call you with
instructions in 40 minutes.
他們說得很清楚
只能有一個人
One person only. They were clear
on that, or I'd go with you.
不然我就和你一起去了
你的下巴怎麼了?
- What happened to your jaw?
- Oh, nothin'.
沒什麼
錢在這裡
Here's the money. And the phone.
還有電話
督爺,請你按照他們的指示
Please, Dude,
follow their instructions.
All right.
好的
她的性命就在你手上
- Her life is in your hands.
- Oh, man, don't say that.
別那樣說
勒保斯基先生要我重複的
Mr Lebowski asked me
to repeat that.
她的性命就在你手上
- Her life is in your hands.
- Shit, man.
她的性命就在你手上,督爺
Her life is in your hands, Dude.
完事後馬上報告
Report back to us
as soon as it's done.
你在搞什麼?
Where the fuck are you goin'?
你拿著,我開車
Take the ringer. I'll drive.
拿什麼?
- What? The what?
- The ringer.
箱子
調包計,督爺
The ringer, Dude.
-他們還沒來電嗎?
-你怎麼...
- What the...
- Have they called?
這是什麼?
- What the hell is this?
- My dirty undies, Dude.
我的髒內褲,督爺
剛想拿去洗的
Laundry. The whites.
沃爾特,你帶著這些來
一定有什麼原因
I'm sure there's a reason
you brought your dirty undies.
沒錯,督爺.要那種重量
The weight.
The ringer cannot look empty.
那箱子不能空著
沃爾特,你想的是什麼?
What the fuck are you thinking?
你說得對
督爺.我應該想想...
You're right, Dude.
I got to thinking,
為什麼我們
只要那小小的兩萬
why should we settle for
a measly fuckin' 20 grand...
我們?怎麼是我們了?
We? You said
you just wanted to come along.
你說你只是想跟我去的
督爺,我說的是...
Why should we settle
for 20 grand
我們手上拿著一百萬的
時候為什麼還想著那兩萬?
when we can keep
the entire million? Am I wrong?
-我錯了嗎?
-是的,你錯了
Yes, you're wrong.
This isn't a game, man.
現在不是在玩遊戲,夥計
但這就是個遊戲
你自己說過的
It is a game.
You said so yourself.
她綁架了自己
- She kidnapped herself.
- I said I thought...
我說我想是...
Dude here.
我是督爺
誰?
'Who is this? '
我是信使,你要我們怎麼辦?
Dude the bagman.
Where do you want us to go?
我們?
- 'Us? '
- Shit!
該死的!
是的,我還有司機
Yeah, you know,
me and the driver.
我不能一邊拿著錢開車
I'm not handling the money,
driving the car...
一邊講電話...
閉嘴!
- 'Shut the fuck up! '
- Are you fucking this up?
督爺,你搞砸了嗎?
那是誰?
Who is that?
That is the driver.
I told you...
那是司機
我告訴過你...
- Shit!
- What the fuck's goin' on?
該死的!
怎麼了?
沃爾特!怎麼了?
- Walter!
- What the fuck is goin' on?
他掛機了!
He hung up! You fucked it up!
You fucked it up!
你搞砸了!
你搞砸了!
她的性命
在我們手上,夥計
- Her life was in our hands.
- Easy, Dude.
別緊張,督爺
我們什麼也沒做到
We're screwed now.
We don't get shit.
他們一定會殺了她
They're gonna kill her.
We're fucked, Walter.
我們搞砸了,沃爾特
什麼也沒搞砸,督爺
Nothing is fucked, Dude.
You're being very unDude.
你現在不像督爺
他們會再來電的
They'll call back.
She kidnapped...
她綁架了...
看到了嗎?
什麼也沒搞砸,督爺
You see?
Nothing's fucked here, Dude.
什麼也沒搞砸
他們只是一幫
業餘的混蛋!
They're a bunch
of fuckin' amateurs!
沃爾特,先閉嘴好嗎?
Hey, will you shut the fuck up?
我在做正事的時候別搗亂
Don't say peep
while I'm doin' business here.
好吧,督爺
OK, Dude, have it your way.
他們只是業餘的
- But they're amateurs.
- Fuck.
操
- Dude.
- 'OK, we proceed,
督爺
好了,我們繼續
但不能再耍花樣
'but only if there's
no funny stuff.'
Yeah, yeah.
好的
不再耍花樣,好了嗎?
'So no funny stuff, OK? '
告訴我們該去哪裡
Just tell me
where the fuck to go.
那裡有個標誌
That was the sign, man.
我們要做的
就是帶她回來
So all we gotta do
is get her back.
不能抱怨誰
No one can complain,
and we keep the baksheesh.
小費我們留著
Terrific, Walter,
好極了,沃爾特
但你還沒告訴我
怎樣帶她回來
but how are we
gonna get her back?
她在哪裡?
那是很簡單的,督爺
That's the simple part, Dude.
我們去交換
We make the hand... off,
I grab one, beat it out of him.
讓我把那個傢伙打昏
- Huh?
- Yeah. That's a great plan.
是啊,那是一個
很好的計劃
沃爾特,你真是天才
That's fucking ingenious,
if I understand it correctly.
如果我的理解是對的
這就像瑞士
手錶那樣精確
It's a Swiss fuckin' watch.
沒錯,督爺
它的美就在於簡潔
Yeah, the beauty
of this is its simplicity.
一旦計劃變得複雜
If it gets complex,
everything can go wrong.
什麼都會出錯
如果說我學到了什麼...
If I learned one thing
in 'Nam, it's...
我是督爺
- Dude.
- 'You're coming to a bridge.
你們將要到達一座木橋
過橋的時候...
'When you cross the bridge,
不要停車,將箱子從
左邊的窗戶扔出去
'you throw the bag from the left
window. You're being watched.'
你們正被監視
Fuck!
該死的!
他怎麼說?在哪裡交換?
What'd he say?
Where's the hand... off?
現在沒有交換了
There isn't one, we throw
the money out of the car.
我們要在那木橋上
將錢扔下去
We throw the money
out of the moving car!
開著車將錢扔下去
不,我們不能那樣做,督爺
We can't do that.
That fucks up our plan.
那樣會搞砸我們的計劃
給他們電話
解釋一下,沃爾特
Call 'em and explain it to them.
你的計劃太簡單了
You're plan is so simple
I'm sure they'll understand.
我肯定他們會明白的
那就是它的美
木橋是嗎?
I'm throwin' the money, Walter.
We're not fuckin' around.
我要把錢扔下去,沃爾特
不能這樣搞砸了
督爺,木橋就到了
Bridge is comin' up.
Give me the ringer.
快把調包的箱子給我
去你的,沃爾特
Fuck that. I love ya,
but you have to face the fact
但你遲早要面對那事實
你是個該死的傻瓜
- you're a goddamn moron.
- No time to argue.
督爺,沒時間爭論了
那木橋
- Hey, man.
- The bridge.
沃爾特!
Hey, Walter! Hey! Walter!
沃爾特!
出去了!
There goes the ringer!
怎麼了?!
- What the fuck?
- Here, your wheel.
督爺,你開車
時速保持15英里
我滾出去
At 15 mph, I roll out,
grab one and beat it out of him.
我回頭將他們
其中一個收拾掉
-烏茲衝鋒鎗
-烏茲衝鋒鎗?!
- The Uzi.
- Uzi?
你不會以為
我空手滾出去吧?
- I'm not rolling out naked.
- Walter, please!
沃爾特,拜託了
15英里,督爺.來吧!
15, Dude. This is it.
在我們這裡!
We have it! We have it!
在我們這裡!
在我們這裡!
We have it!
在...我們這裡!
We... have it!
Aw, fuck it, Dude.
好了,督爺
我們去打保齡吧
Let's go bowling.
督爺,像我前妻那樣說
這不是我能控制的
Etz chaim he, Dude,
as the ex used to say.
那是什麼鬼意思?
What the fuck does that mean?
我們該怎樣和
勒保斯基說呢?
What the fuck
are we gonna tell Lebowski?
Huh? Oh, him. Uh...
他...
問題到底是什麼?
Well, what exactly
is the problem?
問題是...
The problem is...
你...
What do you mean, what's the...
我們根本沒有...
There was no...
We... we didn't, uh...
他們一定會殺了
那可憐的女人
They're gonna kill
that poor woman.
你在說什麼?
The poor woman...
那女人是個婊子
That poor slut kidnapped
herself. You said so yourself.
綁架了自己
督爺,你說過的
我說可能她綁架了自己
I said I thought
she kidnapped herself.
只有你才那麼肯定
- You're the one who's certain.
- 100% certain.
沒錯,督爺
100%肯定
他們寄信要求下周比賽
- They posted the next round.
- Shut the fuck...
多尼...我們的
對手是哪一隊?
- When do we play?
- This Saturday.
本週六,昆提那和...
週六?那他們就要改期了
Saturday?
They have to reschedule.
沃爾特,我該怎麼
和勒保斯基說?
What am I gonna tell Lebowski?
我要和負責
安排賽事的混蛋說
I told that fuck
at the league office...
-沃爾特-誰負責的?
- Who's in charge of scheduling?
- Burkhalter.
博克豪特
我跟他們說多少次了
我在安息日不打保齡
I told that kraut
I don't roll on Shabbos.
他已經寄信了
- He already posted it.
- He can fuckin' unpost it!
他可以要求退回的!
誰會在乎?!
Who gives a shit?
They're gonna kill that woman.
他們一定會殺了
那可憐的女人
我該怎麼和勒保斯基說?
What am I gonna tell Lebowski?
督爺
很顯然她已經
厭倦了這個遊戲
She'll get tired
of her game and go back.
已經想回家了
你為什麼不能在
週六打保齡,沃爾特?
- Why not on Saturday?
- I'm Shomer Shabbos.
我要過安息日
那是什麼,沃爾特?
What's that?
同時...
我該怎麼和勒保斯基說?
What do I tell Lebowski?
週六就是安息日
Saturday is Shabbos,
the Jewish day of rest.
那就意味者我不工作
不開車...
I don't work,
I don't drive a car,
不能數錢...
I don't handle money,
I don't turn on the oven,
而且肯定不能打保齡!
and I sure as shit
don't fucking roll!
天啊
Sheesh.
安息日!
Shomer Shabbos!
沃爾特...
- Walter, how am I gonna...
- Shomer fucking Shabbos.
安息日
夠了!我要走了
- That's it! I'm outta here.
- Come on, Dude.
督爺
督爺!
Dude! Dude!
你就告訴他...
Look, you just tell him...
Tell him we made the drop
and everything went...
我們把錢扔下去了
一切就像...
- How'd it go?
- Went all right.
怎麼了?
沒什麼,督爺車上有些寶貝
沃爾特,我們沒去交換人質
Walter, we didn't make
the fuckin' hand... off.
他們沒拿到錢!
They didn't get the fuckin'
money! They're gonna...
他們一定會...
他們一定會殺了
那可憐的女人
They're gonna kill
that poor woman.
他們一定會殺了
那可憐的女人
沃爾特,如果
你不能開車...
If you can't go by car, how
do you get around on Shammos?
你怎麼去參加
安息日儀式?
督爺,你真的讓我吃驚了
Really, Dude, you surprise me.
他們不會殺人的
他們一無是處
They're not gonna do shit.
What can they do to her?
他們能對她怎樣?
只是一幫烏合之眾
They're amateurs, and meanwhile,
而且你看看
who's sittin' on a million
fucking dollars? Am I wrong?
現在誰拿著那一百萬呢?
-我說錯了嗎?
-沃爾特...
現在誰有一百萬
放在我們車子後面呢?
Who's got a million
fuckin' dollars in our car?
我們的車,沃爾特?
Our car, Walter?
他們呢?只有我的髒內褲
What do they got? My dirty
undies. My fuckin' whites.
那些白色內褲
Say, Dude...
督爺
你的車呢?
where is your car?
誰拿了你的內褲,沃爾特?
Who's got your undies?
你的車呢,督爺?
- Where's your car, Dude?
- You don't know?
你不知道嗎,沃爾特?
It was parked in a handicap
zone. Perhaps they towed it.
停在殘疾人專用區的
可能被拖走了
你都知道它被偷了
You fuckin' know
it's been stolen.
肯定有這個可能,督爺
Well, certainly,
that's a possibility, Dude.
該死的
Oh, fuck it.
你去哪裡,督爺?
- Where you goin', Dude?
- I'm going home, Donny.
我要回家,多尼
電話在響啊,督爺
- Phone's ringing, Dude.
- Thank you, Donny.
謝謝提醒,多尼
Uh... yeah...
是的...
綠色...
Green... uh, some brown or...
有些棕色的...
rust colouration.
銹跡
在車裡有什麼
值錢的東西嗎?
Was there anything
of value in the car?
Oh. Uh, yeah...
有的
一台音響
a tape deck,
some Creedence tapes,
一些磁帶
還有...
and there was a... uh...
我們公文包
My briefcase.
In the briefcase?
在公文包裡面呢?
Uh, papers.
文件
只是文件
You know, just papers.
我的文件
You know, my papers.
Business papers.
生意文件
And what do you do, sir?
你做什麼生意,先生?
I'm unemployed.
我現在失業
My rug was also stolen.
我的地毯也被偷了
你的地毯在車上嗎?
Your rug was in the car?
不,在這裡被偷的
No, here.
Separate incidents?
獨立事件?
督爺不在家
'The Dude is not in... '
你們經常找回那些失車嗎?
Do you find them much,
these stolen cars?
Sometimes.
有時吧
但別對那音響有太大希望
- No hope for the tape deck.
- Or the Creedence.
那麼...
Well, what about, uh...
The briefcase?
我的公文包呢?
勒保斯基先生,我想見你
'Mr Lebowski,
I'd like to see you.
請回電,我會派車接你
'My name is Maude Lebowski.
I'm the one who took your rug.'
我叫莫迪.勒保斯基
我就是拿走你地毯的人
看來那案子已經解決了
Guess we can close
the file on that one.
Elfranco, ay�dame abajo.
I'll be with you
in a moment, Mr Lebowski.
請稍等,勒保斯基先生
女性的形態讓你覺得
舒服嗎,勒保斯基先生?
Does the female form make you
uncomfortable, Mr Lebowski?
這就是那樣的一幅畫嗎?
Is that what
this is a picture of?
在某種意義上,是的
我的藝術被認為與
女性的陰道有關
In a sense, yes.
My art is strongly vaginal,
which bothers some men.
這個詞讓某些
男人覺得不自在
The word itself makes some
men uncomfortable. Vagina.
陰道
是嗎?
Oh, yeah?
是的,他們不喜歡聽到
覺得難以啟齒
They find it difficult to say,
but without batting an eye,
男人相對應的
就是他的陽具
a man will refer to his dick
or his rod or his... johnson.
或者叫...小弟弟
- Johnson?
- All right, Mr Lebowski.
小弟弟?
好了,勒保斯基先生
我們說正事吧
Let's get down to cases.
我父親告訴我
他同意了給你那張地毯
My father agreed
to let you have the rug,
但那曾經是我已故
母親的一份禮物
but it was a gift from me
to my late mother,
所以他無權贈送給別人
and not his to give. Now...
現在...
Your face.
你的臉上
關於這次綁架...
As for this kidnapping...
I know all about it,
and that you acted as courier.
沒錯,我知道此事
你的角色是信使
讓我告訴你
Let me tell you something.
It stinks to high heaven.
這件事簡直讓人噁心
沒錯,但讓我解釋
一下地毯的事情
Right, but let me explain
something about the rug.
你喜歡性嗎
勒保斯基先生?
- Do you like sex, Mr Lebowski?
- Excuse me?
什麼?
性交,愛的身體行為
Sex. The physical act of love.
Coitus. Do you like it?
你喜歡嗎?
我剛在說我的地毯
I was talking about my rug.
你對性不感興趣?
- You're not interested in sex?
- You mean coitus?
你說的是性交?
我也喜歡
I like it. It's a myth about
feminists that we hate sex.
這是關於女權
主義者的男性神話
我們討厭性
這可以成為一種自然的
「性」致很高的產業
It can be a natural, zesty
enterprise. But some people...
然而有某些人...
被稱為色情狂
satyriasis in men,
nymphomania in women...
不能自控地參與而且
沒有任何樂趣可言
engage in it compulsively
and without joy.
不是吧
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes, Mr Lebowski.
是的,勒保斯基先生
那些不幸的人不能去愛
They cannot love
in the true sense of the word.
我們都認識的邦妮
就是其中之一
Our mutual acquaintance,
Bunny, is one of these.
莫迪
Listen, Maude,
如果你的繼母是個
戀男狂,我很抱歉
um, I'm sorry if your
stepmother is a nympho,
但我覺得這個與我的...
but what has that
to do with, uh...
- Do you have any Kahlua?
- Take a look at this, sir.
你有卡魯哇酒嗎?
看看這個吧,先生
我認識這男人
Oh, I know that guy.
他是一個虛無主義者
He's a nihilist.
Karl Hungus...
嗨
- 'Hi.
- Hello. Meine dispatcher says
總部說你這裡的
線路有些問題
'there's something
wrong mit deine kabel.
是的,我不知道
出了什麼問題
'Come in. I'm not sure
exactly what's wrong.
所以他們派我來
我是個專家
'Zat's why they sent me.
I am an expert.
電視機在這裡
'The TV's in here.'
你一定能認出她
You recognise her, of course.
這是我的朋友莎莉
'That's my friend. She came
over to use the shower.'
她只是來洗澡的
這故事非常無稽
The story is ludicrous.
我叫卡爾,維修工人
'Meine name is Karl.
Ich bin expert.'
你一定是來修線路的
'You're here to fix the cable.'
之後的事情
你也應該想像到了
You can imagine
where it goes from here.
他修線路?
- He fixes the cable?
- Don't be fatuous, Jeffrey.
別那麼笨了
這女人從事色情行業
對我來說是無關痛癢的
Little matter that she pursues
a career in pornography
更不用說他勾搭上了
傑奇.特裡赫姆
nor that she's been
"banging" Jackie Treehorn,
這是我們說話的方式
to use the parlance
of our times.
然而我是勒保斯基
基金會的兩個托管人之一
But I am one of the two trustees
of the Lebowski Foundation,
另外一個是我生母
the other being my father.
我們的基金會領養了
一些年輕人...
The Foundation
takes youngsters...
是啊,那些成就者
Shit, yeah, the achievers.
沒錯,就是他們
Little Lebowski
Urban Achievers, yes.
我們對他們感到很驕傲
我問我父親關於在
基金戶口的一百萬提款
I asked my father about
his withdrawal of $1 million,
and he told me
about this abduction.
他就告訴我這次拐騙事件
但我認為這是荒謬的
It is preposterous.
This compulsive fornicator
那個私通者想騙取
我父親的錢財
is taking my father
for the proverbial ride.
是的,但我的...
- But my...
- I'm getting to your rug.
我正想說到你的地毯
我和父親相處並不融洽『
My father and I don't get along.
他不贊同我的生活風格
We don't approve
of each other's lifestyles.
不必說,我也不贊同他的
但我不想就他的
行為訴諸法律
But I hardly wish to make his
embezzlement a police matter.
所以我建議
你向那些壞人...
I propose that you try
to recover the money.
要回那一筆錢
我可以那樣做的
Well, I could do that.
如果你成功做到了
我會將...
If you do so,
I will compensate you
收回數目的10%
作為你的賠償
to the tune of 10%
of the recovered sum.
A hundred...
10萬...
...thousand, yes, bones or clams
or whatever you call them.
沒錯
10萬美金
但是...
Yeah, but...
what about my, uh...
我的...
沒錯,還有你的地毯
有了那筆錢
Your rug. With that money
you can buy any rug
你可以買到對我沒有
任何情感價值的地毯
that doesn't have
sentimental value for me.
我還要對你下巴的
拳傷道歉
I am sorry about
that crack on the jaw.
那沒什麼...
Oh, that's fine.
That doesn't even, uh...
這是一位醫生的名片
Here's the number of a doctor
who will look at it.
他會為你服務的
你不必付帳
You'll receive no bill.
He's a good man.
他很好人,工作很徹底
你真體貼,不過...
- That's thoughtful, but...
- Please see him.
請你去找他
他很好人,而且很徹底
He's a good man.
那麼...
Oh, well... all right.
好吧
他說,我老婆總是給我麻煩
讓我不得安寧
He says, "My wife's a pain.
"She's always bustin'
my friggin' agates.
我女兒嫁了一個無用的丈夫
"My daughter's married
to a loser bastard,
我的屁股也長皮疹了
"and I got a rash
so bad on my ass
不能坐下來
"I can't sit down. But you
know me, can't complain."
但我不能抱怨什麼
沒錯
Fuckin' A, man.
I got a rash, man.
是啊
Fuckin' A.
我告訴你吧
I gotta tell you, man,
以前的我總是覺得很沮喪
earlier in the day,
I was feeling shitty, man.
無精打采
Down in the dumps.
失去了不少錢財...
Lost a little money...
別想那些了
Hey, you know what?
Forget about it.
算了吧
沒錯
I can't be worried about
that shit. Life goes on, man.
我不應該再擔心那些事情
生活還要繼續啊
到家了,先生
Home, sweet home, Mr L.
看啊
Look. Who's your friend
in the Volkswagen?
你那位開大眾汽車的
朋友是誰?
他跟隨我們到這裡的
Yeah, he followed us here.
他什麼時候...啊!
When did he start foll...
What the fuck?
搞什麼?!
進去裡面,你這個混蛋
In the limo, you son of a bitch.
No arguing.
小心點,我還拿著飲料
Careful, man.
There's a beverage here.
開始說話
Start talking and talk fast,
you lousy bum.
快點,你這個該死的遊民
我們在瘋狂地找你,督爺
We've been trying
to reach you, Dude.
我的錢在哪裡?!
Where's my goddamn money,
you bum?
我們...
W... well, we...
我...
I don't...
他們沒收到,笨蛋!
They did not receive
the money, you nitwit!
他們沒收到那筆錢!
她的性命在你手上!
- Her life was in your hands!
- This is our concern, Dude.
這是我們所關注的,督爺
現在沒什麼搞砸了
No, man, nothing is fucked here.
沒什麼搞砸了?!
- Nothing is fucked?
- No, man.
是的
飛機已經撞毀了!
The goddamn plane
has crashed into the mountain!
聽我說
Come on, who are you gonna
believe, those guys or...
你要相信
那些人還是相信...
We dropped off the damn money.
我們把錢扔下去了
We?
我們?!
I.
我
我代表我們
The royal we.
You know, the editorial.
像那些社論一樣
我按他們的
要求把錢扔下去
I dropped off the money
exactly as per...
我得到的信息是很確切的
I've got certain
information, all right?
有些事情暴露了出來...
Certain things
have come to light, and...
你有沒有想過...
Has it ever occurred to you
除了到處跑
that instead of,
you know, running around,
還有責怪我...
blaming me, given the nature
of all this new shit,
這事情會比想像
之中更加...
this could be a lot more...
負責嗎?
Complex?
這也許不是預料中
那麼簡單的
I mean, it might not be
such a simple, uh... you know?
你知道嗎?
你究竟在說些什麼?
What in God's name
are you blathering about?
我在告訴你我要說的
I'll tell you
what I'm blathering about.
我收到信息,夥計
I've got information.
New shit has come to light.
有新的問題出現了
而且是...
And, shit, man...
她綁架了她自己
She kidnapped herself.
是啊
Well, sure, man.
一個放蕩女子...
Look at it.
A young trophy wife,
我們是這樣說的...
in the parlance of our times.
她在城裡欠了很多債
She owes money all over town,
還有那個色情電影製片人
including to
known pornographers.
那真的很酷啊
And that's cool. That's cool.
我要說的是,她需要錢
I'm saying she needs money, man.
還有...
And... and, you know,
他們肯定會說沒拿到的
of course they're gonna say
they didn't get it,
因為她想要更多
because she wants more, man.
她有那麼多手下...
She's gotta feed the monkey.
I mean...
你從來沒想過這些嗎?
Hasn't that ever
occurred to you, man? Sir?
先生?
沒有,勒保斯基先生
No, Mr Lebowski,
it had not occurred to me.
我從沒想過
我們從沒想過,督爺
That had not occurred
to us, Dude.
你知道...
新出現的麻煩和你們
並沒有利害關係...
You guys aren't privy
to all the new shit, so...
但是...
you know. But...
那是你們僱用我去做的
Hey, that's what you pay me for.
說到這個
你們現在能否...
Speaking of which,
do you think that you could...
將我的兩萬元兌現呢?
give me my 20,000 in cash?
我本來要找我的
會計核對一下...
My concern is... and I gotta
check with my accountant...
但這樣我必須
交很多稅,所以...
but this might bump me
into a higher tax...
布蘭特...
把信封給他
Brandt... Give him the envelope.
如果你們給現金
Oh, if you've already got the
cheque made out, that's coolOOOh
那就最好
我們早上收到這個
We received this this morning.
你的使命沒有完成
Since you have
failed to achieve,
那是如此簡單的任務
even in the modest task
which was your charge,
既然你偷了我的錢
since you have stolen my money,
既然你背叛了
我的信任...
since you have unrepentantly
betrayed my trust...
I have no choice
我別無選擇
只能告訴你這個
遊民該做什麼
but to tell these bums
to do whatever is necessary
你要賠償那筆錢,勒保斯基
to recover their money
from you, Jeffrey Lebowski.
布蘭特做我的證人
With Brandt as my witness,
I will tell you this:
我告訴你
邦妮受到的傷害
Any further harm
visited upon Bunny
將10倍加於你頭上
will be visited tenfold
upon your head.
我不能再接受另一隻腳趾
By God, sir, I will not
abide another toe.
那不是她的腳趾,督爺
That wasn't her toe, Dude.
- Whose toe was it, Walter?
- How the fuck should I know?
那是誰的,沃爾特?
我怎麼知道?
我知道的是沒有
任何跡象表明...
Nothing about it indicates...
那趾甲油,沃爾特
- The nail polish, Walter.
- Fine, Dude.
好了,督爺
那趾甲油也可以
塗在其他人的腳趾上
You can get nail polish and
apply it to someone else's toe.
其他人的?
Where the fuck
are they gonna get...
他們怎麼可以...
You want a toe?
I can get you a toe.
你要腳趾嗎?我可以找到
相信我吧,肯定
有辦法的,督爺
Believe me,
there are ways, Dude.
你不會想知道的
You don't wanna know about it.
今天下午3點前
我就能給你一隻腳趾
I can get you a toe
by 3 pm, with nail polish.
有趾甲油的
那些該死的混蛋
These fuckin' amateurs.
They send us a toe,
沃爾特...
他們給我送來了一隻腳趾
我們本應該很害怕的
we're supposed to shit ourselves
with fear. Jesus Christ!
沃爾特...
問題是...
他們會殺了她的,沃爾特
They're gonna kill her
and then me.
然後他們就要來殺我
Dude... that's...
督爺...
That's just
the stress talking, man.
那只是威脅的手段
這讓我覺得...
We have what appears to me
是一些對他人無害的犯罪
to be a series
of victimless crimes.
那腳趾呢?
- What about the toe?
- Forget about the fucking toe!
別說那腳趾了!
不好意思
你們可以小聲一點嗎?
Could you keep your voices down?
This is a family restaurant.
這是一間家庭餐廳
拜託了
Dear, for your information,
告訴你,最高法院
已經否決了這種限制!
the Supreme Court
has rejected prior restraint!
沃爾特,這和
第一修正案沒關係
This is not
a First Amendment thing.
如果你不冷靜下來
If you don't calm down,
you'll have to leave.
我只能要求你離開
我見過在泥地裡死掉的人
Lady, my buddies died
face... down in the muck
所以我可以在這裡吃東西!
so we could enjoy
this family restaurant!
好了,我要走了
- I'm outta here.
- Dude, don't go away, man.
督爺,別走啊
這對我們都有影響
This affects all of us.
我們基本的自由啊!
There are basic freedoms!
I'm stayin'.
我不走
我在喝咖啡
I'm finishing my coffee.
享受著咖啡
Enjoying my coffee.
督爺不在
'The Dude is not in.
請留言
'Leave a message after the beep.
Thanks, man.'
謝謝
勒保斯基先生,我是
洛杉磯警察局的羅探員
'Mr Lebowski, this is duty
officer Rolvaag of the LAPD.
我們找到了你的失車
'We've recovered
your automobile.
在北好萊塢停車場可以認領
'It can be claimed at... '
太好了
Far out, man. Far fucking out!
太好了!
Hey! This is
a private residence, man.
這是私人住宅啊
不錯嘛
Ah, nice marmot.
Vere is the money, Lebowski.
Ve vant the money, Lebowski.
我們要那筆錢,勒保斯基
我們要那筆錢,勒保斯基
你以為我們在開玩笑嗎?
You zink ve are kidding
or making with the funny stuff?
有些東西你還沒夢想過
勒保斯基
Things you haven't
dreamed of, Lebowski.
我們什麼也不相信
Ve believes in nossing,
Lebowski, nossing.
他什麼也不相信
勒保斯基
明天我們會回來
Ve come back
and ve cut off your chonson.
將你的小弟弟切掉
Excuse me?
什麼?
我說我們要將你的
小弟弟切掉!
I said we'll
cut off your johnson!
想想吧,勒保斯基
Just think about that, Lebowski.
就是你那雞巴,勒保斯基
Ja, your viggly penis, Lebowski.
也許我們可以
扯下來,勒保斯基
Maybe we stomp on it
and sqoosh it, Lebowski.
昨晚被人發現的
It was discovered last night
停靠在橋墩底下
- lodged against an abutment.
- Oh, man, lodged where?
哪裡?
它沒被撞散了架
已經算走運了
You're lucky she didn't
get chopped, Mr Lebowski.
勒保斯基先生
他們一定在到處兜風
A joyride situation.
撞到擋土牆之後就遺棄了
They abandon the vehicle
once they hit the wall.
我的公文包啊!
My fucking briefcase!
Man, it's not here. Shit!
不在裡面!
我在報告上看到了,很抱歉
I saw the report. Sorry.
你得從另一邊進去
You gotta get in
on the other side.
後鏡在路上找到的
The side... view was found
on the road by the car.
就在車子旁邊
那音響還在
已經算你走運了
You're lucky they left the
tape deck, and the Creedence.
還有那唱片
Aw, Jesus!
What's that smell, man?
天啊!什麼氣味?
Probably a vagrant
slept in the car
或者被人當作廁所使用
or just used it as a toilet.
Hey, man...
朋友...
Are you gonna find
these guys, you know...
你一定能找到
那幫傢伙,或者...
I mean, you got any
promising, uh, leads or...
總有一些線索...
Leads? Yeah, sure.
線索?
I'll just check with the boys
down at the crime lab.
當然有了
我會和罪案調查組的人說的
They got four more detectives
working on the case.
他們有4個人
可以調查這案子
They got us working in shifts.
我們只是來換班的
線索
我唯一的願望就是在那幫
德國佬切掉我小弟弟之前
Leads?
讓那老勒保斯基殺了我
I hope the big Lebowski kills me
那太荒謬了,督爺
before the Germans
can cut my dick off.
沒人會切掉你的小弟弟
謝謝你,沃爾特
我沒說什麼
That is just ridiculous, Dude.
No one'll cut your dick off.
謝謝,沃爾特
這讓我覺得非常安全
- Thank you.
- Not if I have anything to say.
督爺
讓我內心非常溫暖
- That makes me feel secure.
- Dude.
督爺
這件麻煩的事情
- It makes me feel warm inside.
- Now, Dude.
我可以和那帶著
尿跡的地毯留在這裡
This whole fuckin' thing.
但我不會那樣
I could be sitting here
with just pee stains on my rug.
該死的德國佬
什麼也沒改變
- But, no, man, I gotta...
- Fucking Germans.
該死的納粹
他們是納粹嗎,督爺?
Nothing changes. Fucking Nazis.
多尼
他們以閹割作為恐嚇
They were Nazis, Dude?
我們要在
這裡喋喋不休嗎?
不
Come on, Donny, they
were threatening castration.
我錯了嗎?
他...
他們是虛無主義者
- Are we gonna split hairs?
- No.
他們一直說自己
什麼也不相信
- Am I wrong?
- Well, he...
They were nihilists, man.
虛無主義者
They kept saying
they believed in nothing.
該死的
Nihilists.
說說你對社會主義
有什麼要求吧,督爺
Fuck me.
起碼這是一種思潮
Say what you want about the
tenets of national socialism,
我們不要忘記...
不要忘記,督爺...
at least it's an ethos.
收養野生動物
那兩棲齧齒動物
And also,
let's not forget, Dude,
在這城市裡面...
that keeping wildlife,
an amphibious rodent
for, you know, domestic...
是違反法律的
你現在成了
動物管理員了嗎?
within the city...
不,我只是想...
That ain't legal either.
誰在乎那該死的土撥鼠呢?
- Are you a fucking park ranger?
- No, I'm just...
我們只是在同情,督爺
Who gives a shit
about the fucking marmot?
該死的同情
我不需要你們的同情
- We are sympathising, Dude.
- Fuck sympathy.
我要留著我的小弟弟
你要來做什麼呢,督爺?
I don't need your fucking
sympathy. I need my johnson.
你要振作起來!
你不能帶著負面的
影響參加比賽
- What do you need that for?
- You've got to buck up!
操那比賽
操你的,沃爾特
You cannot drag this negative
energy into the tournament.
Fuck the tournament.
Fuck you, Walter.
操那比賽?
督爺,我明白你的心情
Fuck the tournament?
多尼
OK, Dude. I can see you
don't want to be cheered up.
我們去打一輪吧
Come on, Donny.
Let's go get us a lane.
再來一杯
好的,督爺
- Another Caucasian, Gary.
- Right, Dude.
朋友們都喜歡這個,是吧?
是啊,督爺
Friends like these,
huh, Gary?
That's right, Dude.
有好的撒爾沙酒嗎?
蘇城的撒爾沙酒?
Do you have a good Sarsaparilla?
是啊,那裡的很好
Sioux City Sarsaparilla?
Yeah. That's a good one.
你好嗎,督爺?
不是很好
How you doin' there, Dude?
很不順心是吧?
Not too good, man.
是啊
- One of those days, huh?
- Yeah.
一個比我
賢明的人說過...
Well...
有時候反吃一口...
A wiser fella than myself
once said,
事情就會解決了
"Sometimes you eat
the bar and..."
反吃一口...
Much obliged.
他會吃你
那是東部的諺語嗎?
"And sometimes the bar, well...
"he eats you."
很遙遠的
That some kind of Eastern thing?
Far from it.
我喜歡你的風格,督爺
I like your style, Dude.
我也在鑽研你的風格
你的風格很牛仔
Hmm. Well...
I dig your style, too, man.
You got
a whole cowboy thing going.
謝謝
還有一件事,督爺
Thankee.
什麼?
你必須用那麼多
詛咒的詞語嗎?
- There's just one thing, Dude.
- What's that?
Do you have to use
so many cuss words?
你在說什麼?
What the fuck
are you talking about?
好吧,督爺
堅持你的方式
別對她的事太緊張,督爺
OK, Dude, have it your way.
謝謝
Take her easy, Dude.
Yeah. Thanks, man.
你的電話,督爺
Call for you, Dude.
喂?
傑弗裡,你還沒去看醫生
是啊,我還沒去
Hello?
'Jeffrey, you have
not gone to the doctor.'
我想馬上見你
Uh, oh, yeah.
No... no, I haven't yet.
'I'd like to
see you immediately.'
Oh?
你就是勒保斯基
是啊
- So you're Lebowski.
- Yeah.
莫迪將你的事情都告訴我了
她很快就回來,請坐
要喝點什麼嗎?
Maude has told me all about you.
好的,白色俄羅斯
She'll be back
in a minute. Sit down.
酒吧檯在那邊
- Do you want a drink?
- Yeah, sure. White Russian.
The bar's over there.
你做什麼的,勒保斯基?
你是什麼人?
- So what do you do, Lebowski?
- Who the fuck are you, man?
莫迪的一個朋友
屁股裂開的朋友?
Just a friend of Maudie's.
你做什麼的?
The friend
with the cleft asshole?
沒什麼
你好,傑弗裡
What do you do?
你好
你好嗎?
Oh, nothing much.
莫迪
我必須...
Hello, Jeffrey.
Yeah, how are you?
Listen, Maude,
向你請辭
I got to, uh...
因為...你母親似乎...
真的被綁架了
tender my resignation
or whatever.
幾乎可以肯定她不是
It looks like your mother
really was kidnapped after all.
你為什麼
有時候不聽我的話?
She most certainly was not.
你也許可以學到什麼
Hey, man,
why don't you fucking...
現在...
別稱呼她為我母親
listen occasionally?
You might learn something.
她是個罪犯而不是受害者
- Now, I got...
- Don't call her my mother.
我得到了
非常確切的證據...
She's the perpetrator
and not the victim.
從誰那裡得來?
-那個男人...-奧利
I got pretty
definitive evidence...
奧利?
她在色情電影裡面的搭檔?
- From who?
- From the main guy, Uli.
那電影...
Uli Kunkel? Her co... star
in the beaver picture?
你認識那男人?
Beaver? You mean vagina...
我已經介紹過他
I mean, you know the guy?
你記得奧利嗎?
I might have introduced them
for all I know.
他過去是個音樂家
Do you remember Uli?
看看我的收藏
70年代後期
發行過一張唱片
He's a musician.
Used to have a group, Autobahn.
類似電子流行音樂
They released
one album in the late 70s.
他在假扮誘騙者?
Their music is
sort of a... technopop.
是的
傑弗裡,你也不會
綁架一個熟悉的人
So he's pretending
to be the abductor?
- Well, yeah.
- Look, Jeffrey,
綁架就不能讓人質在
釋放後認出自己
you don't kidnap someone
you're acquainted with.
我知道
The idea is that the hostage
can't identify you
- after you've let them go.
- I know that.
那傢伙到底有什麼關係?
他是誰?
諾克斯.哈靈頓
錄像藝術師
What the fuck
is with this guy? Who is he?
那麼錢在奧利那裡?
Knox Harrington.
The video artist.
其實不是
- So Uli has the money?
- Well...
這個非常複雜,莫迪
No, not exactly...
很多曲折
This is a very
complicated case, Maude.
諸如此類的事物
很多讓我困惑的事情
A lot of ins and outs
and what... have... yous...
很多讓督爺困惑的事情
A lot of strands
to keep in my head.
喂?
如果錢不在奧利那裡
那麼會在誰手上?
是桑德拉
A lot of strands
in old Duder's head.
我必須接聽這個
Then who has the money?
It's Sandra, about the Biennale.
你還有那醫生的電話嗎?
其實瘀傷也已經退了
I have to take this. Do you
have that doctor's number?
傑弗裡
我不想對任何後效應負責
- It's not bruised any more.
- Please, Jeffrey,
[意大利語]
I don't want to be responsible
for any delayed after... effects.
後效應?
[意大利語]
After... effects?
脫下衣服好嗎
勒保斯基先生?
Could you slide your shorts
down, Mr Lebowski, please?
不必了.她打在我這裡
我知道
脫下衣服好嗎?
No, man. She hit me right here.
I understand.
Could you slide
your shorts down, please?
他住在北好萊塢
拉德弗德路
在那間10漢堡包店附近
He lives in North Hollywood,
在那間10漢堡包店附近
on Radford,
near the In 'n' Out Burger.
那裡的漢堡包
很好吃啊,沃爾特
The In 'n' Out Burger's
on Camrose.
閉嘴,多尼
那小孩在讀九年級,督爺
- Near it.
- Those are good burgers.
他父親是...
Shut the fuck up, Donny.
一個叫迪比
塞勒斯的作家
The kid's in ninth grade,
and his father...
那是什麼人?
Are you ready for this? His
father is Arthur Digby Sellers.
迪比.塞勒斯?
聽說過一個叫「烙印」的
節目嗎,督爺?
Who the fuck is that?
Who the fuck is
Arthur Digby Sellers?
我知道...
只有一個人
可以生存的那個?
Ever heard of a show
called "Branded"?
我知道,沃爾特.
那又怎樣了?
"All but one man died
there at Bitter Creek"?
那個該死的迪比.塞勒斯
寫了156章,督爺
I know the fucking show.
So what?
連續劇啊
Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers
wrote 156 episodes, Dude.
不是個容易對付的傢伙
是啊
The bulk of the series.
而他的兒子是個笨笨
- Not exactly a lightweight.
- No.
我們要到他家裡
And yet his son
is a fucking dunce.
那孩子應該很容易對付的
我們要到
10漢堡包店附近啊
We'll go there
after the what... have... you,
閉嘴,多尼!
we'll brace the kid.
我們要對那孩子逼供
We'll be near
the In 'n' Out Burger.
應該很容易對付
Shut the fuck up, Donny!
我們要奪回
那該死的一百萬
We'll brace the kid.
He should be a pushover.
如果他還沒花光的話
整整一百萬啊
We'll get that fucking
$1 million back...
是啊,我們就要到...
If he hasn't spent it already.
10漢堡包店
A million fucking clams.
- Yes, we'll be near the, uh...
- In 'n' Out.
吃些漢堡包
喝幾杯啤酒
說幾個笑話
我們的麻煩
就要結束了,督爺
Some burgers, some beers,
a few laughs.
Our fucking troubles
are over, Dude.
該死的!
那孩子已經
把錢花光了!
Oh, fuck me, man!
就那輛新車?
還遠著呢,督爺
That kid's already spent
all the money, man!
起碼還剩下90多萬
New 'vette? Hardly, Dude.
看他買了什麼配件
I'd say he still has
960, $970,000 left,
在車裡等著,多尼
depending on the options.
Wait in the car, Donny.
誰?
皮拉爾是嗎?
我是沃爾特
- Yes?
- Pilar?
這是我的助手傑弗裡
My name is Walter Sobchak.
我們是來找拉裡的
This is my associate
Jeffrey Lebowski.
可以進來嗎?
可以
We came to talk about
little Larry. May we come in?
謝謝
- Yes, yes.
- Thank you.
就是他,督爺
That's him, Dude.
你好,先生!
請坐
And a good day to you, sir!
Sit down, please.
拉裡,那位先生來了!
他...
Larry, sweetie,
that man is here!
他還在寫作嗎?
不
Is he... Does he still write?
他有健康問題
Oh, no, no.
He has health problems.
我想說的是...
我們...
個人來說都是你的...
Sir, I just want to say
龐大的支持者之一
that we're both,
on a personal level,
「烙印」,尤其是前面的章節
really enormous fans.
對我們很有啟發
"Branded", especially
the early episodes,
親愛的,下來啊!
這男人是個警察
was truly a source
of inspiration...
不
我們不想給人警察的印象
Sweetie, sit down!
This is the police.
我們不希望報警
Oh, no, ma'am,
we are not exactly the police.
但這取決於小拉裡
We hope it won't
be necessary to call the police.
對嗎,拉裡?
But that's up
to little Larry here.
Isn't it, Larry?
這是你的作業嗎,拉裡?
這是你的作業嗎,拉裡?
Is this your homework, Larry?
督爺
這是你的作業嗎,拉裡?
- Is this your homework?
- Look, man...
問他關於車子的事情
Dude, please.
Is this your homework, Larry?
這是你的嗎?
這是你的作業嗎,拉裡?
外面的車是你的嗎?
Just ask him about the car.
這是你的作業嗎,拉裡?
我們知道這是他的作業!
- Is this your homework, Larry?
- Is that your car out front?
錢在哪裡,你這個臭小子?
- Is this your homework, Larry?
- We know it's his homework!
拉裡...
你聽說過越戰的事情嗎?
Where's the fucking money?
你真讓人頭痛
Look, Larry...
我們知道這是你的作業
你偷了我們的車
Have you heard of Vietnam?
You're entering
a world of pain, son.
還有那些錢!
還有那些錢
我們知道這是你的作業
We know that you stole the car.
我們要切掉你的小弟弟,拉裡
- And the fucking money!
- And the fucking money.
你快要了你爸爸的命了
We know that this
is your homework.
- We'll cut your dick off.
- You're killing your father.
好了
這是沒意義的
好了嗎?
該用B計劃了
All right. This is pointless.
OK? It's time for plan B.
你也許想看看外面,拉裡
這就是惹怒陌生人的後果!
You might want to watch out
that front window, Larry.
Son, this is what happens
有些語言上的問題
when you fuck a stranger
in the ass!
那臭小子惹我發火
Little language problem here.
沃爾特!
The little prick's
stonewalling me.
你在幹什麼?
Walter!
What... what are you doing, man?
你在幹什麼?
看吧,拉裡
What are you doing?
看到了嗎?
Here you go, Larry.
You see what happens?
看到了嗎?
You see what happens, Larry?
這就是惹怒陌生人的後果!
This is what happens
看到嗎?
when you fuck a stranger
in the ass, Larry!
看到了嗎?
This is what happens, Larry!
You see what happens, Larry,
看到嗎,拉裡?
when you fuck a stranger
in the ass?
This is what happens.
看到嗎,拉裡?
You see what happens, Larry?
這就是惹怒陌生人的後果!
You see what happens, Larry?
Do you see what happens, Larry,
這就是後果!
when you fuck a stranger
in the ass?
這就是後果!
不!
這就是後果!
This is what happens, Larry!
This is what happens, Larry!
這就是後果!
- No!
- This is what happens, Larry!
你在幹什麼?!
住手!
This is what happens
when you fuck a stranger...
我上周才買到這輛車的!
What the fuck
are you doing? Stop it!
我要殺了你!
I just bought
that fucking car last week!
我上周才買到這輛車的!
I'm gonna fuckin' kill you!
我要砸了你的車!
I just bought
the fucking car last week!
那不是他的車啊!
I'll kill your
fucking car, man!
該死的!
不!
No! That's not his... hey!
去你的!
- God damn it!
- No! Oh, no!
你喜歡嗎?
去你的!
Fuck you! You like that?
我要砸了你的車!
Fuck you!
I kill your fucking car!
我要砸了你的車!
I kill your fucking car!
我接受你的道歉
不,我只是...
I accept your apology.
想從現在開始自己處理
不
No. I just... want to
handle it by myself from now on.
那與此事無關
No, no, no.
是的,車子熬到回家
That has nothing to do with it.
你在家裡打電話給我
Yes, the car made it home.
不,沃爾特
看起來不是的...
You're calling me at home.
拉裡不會說出什麼
No, Walter, it did not look
like Larry was about to crack.
那是你的猜測
沃爾特,你說得對
Well, that's your perception.
有一句話我還沒說
You know, Walter, you're right.
就是「去你的」!
別管我了!
There is an unspoken message
here. It's "Fuck you"!
沒錯,我會去練習的
Leave me the fuck alone!
Yeah, I'll be at practice.
戴上你的尿布,勒保斯基
傑奇.特裡赫姆想見你
傑奇.特裡赫姆知道
你是哪個勒保斯基
Pin your diapers on. Jackie
Treehorn wants to see you.
傑奇.特裡赫姆想見
那個游手好閒的勒保斯基
Jackie Treehorn knows
which Lebowski you are.
你要應付的不是白癡
Jackie Treehorn wants to see
the deadbeat Lebowski.
You're not dealing with morons.
你好,督爺
謝謝你的到來
我是傑奇.特裡赫姆
Hello, Dude. Thanks for coming.
你這裡地方不錯啊
I'm Jackie Treehorn.
像世外桃源
This is quite a pad
you got here, man.
喝點什麼嗎,督爺?
白色俄羅斯,謝謝
Completely unspoiled.
白色俄羅斯
- What's your drink, Dude?
- White Russian. Thanks.
你的色情電影生意怎樣了?
White Russian.
我也不知道,督爺
How's the smut business, Jackie?
我是做出版的
娛樂
I wouldn't know, Dude.
政治主張
I deal in publishing,
一種僵局?
很遺憾,那是對的
entertainment,
political advocacy.
成人娛樂被加上了標準
- Oh. Which one's "Logjammin"'?
- Yes, regrettably, it's true.
這是錄像,督爺
既然我們要和那些
業餘的傢伙競爭
Standards have fallen
in adult entertainment.
我們可以投資一些
有情節的故事
It's video, Dude.
Now that we're
competing with amateurs,
加大生產量
we can't afford to invest
in extras, like story,
加入感情
production value,
人們忘記了...
大腦是最大的情慾地帶
feelings.
You know, people forget
也許在你身上是的
that the brain is
the biggest erogenous zone.
當然有利也有弊
可以用新的技術
做一些刺激的事情
On you maybe.
You have to take
the good with the bad.
那些交互式的色情軟件
New technology permits us
to do exciting things
未來的衝擊波,督爺
100%電子化
in interactive erotic software.
Wave of the future, Dude.
我還是喜歡手動的
100% electronic.
Well...
I still jerk off manually.
當然了
我知道你很迫不及待
就在這裡,督爺
Of course you do.
I can see you're anxious
for me to get to the point.
邦妮在哪裡?
我還以為你知道呢
Well, here it is, Dude.
我怎麼會知道?
Where's Bunny?
她為了那一筆數目不小的
債而從我這裡逃跑了
- I thought you might know that.
- Why would I?
不,她沒逃跑,只是...
She ran off to get away from
that sizeable debt to me.
那綁架的故事
我聽說了,省下吧
我知道你被夾在中間,督爺
She didn't run off.
She's been...
我也不在乎你想從
他丈夫那裡得到什麼
I've heard that story.
I know you're
mixed up in this, Dude.
那是你的事情
I don't care what you're
trying to get from the husband.
我要說的是...
我要我的東西
That's your business.
是啊
有很多刻面
All I'm saying is...
很多部分
- I want mine.
- Yeah, right, man.
There are a lot of...
facets to this,
不好意思
a lot of interested parties.
Excuse me.
是啊
那是什麼?
Yeah?
Oh, yeah.
Where's that?
好了
All right.
不好意思
Excuse me.
原諒我
沒問題
- Forgive me.
- No problemo, man.
如果我找到你的錢...
So, uh...
對我有什麼好處?
If I, uh, can find your money...
那當然是可以商量的
What's in it for the Dude?
再來一杯嗎?
是的,樹林裡的尿液好嗎?
Of course, there's that
to discuss. Refill?
10%的費用
好嗎?
The Pope shit in the woods?
好的
成交
好,我欣賞你做生意的方式
10% finder's fee.
That all right?
OK. Done, Jackie.
你的錢在一個叫
拉裡.塞勒斯的小孩那裡
I dig the way
you do business, man.
他住在北好萊塢
Your money is being held
by a kid named Larry Sellers.
拉德弗德路...
在10漢堡包附近
He lives in North Hollywood,
on Radford, uh...
他是個臭小子
但我想你的手下...
by the In 'n' Out Burger.
一定能搞定的,他才15歲
A fuckin' brat,
but I'm sure
you can get it off him.
該死的學生
I mean, he's 15.
Flunking social studies.
如果你可以...
寫一張支票,50萬的10%...
So, if you could just, uh...
5簽...
write me a cheque
for my 10% of half a million...
我就會出去
five grand...
I'll go out and mingle.
你的酒調得不賴啊,傑奇
一個15歲的小子
You mix a hell
of a Caucasian, Jackie.
那是開玩笑嗎?
A 15... year... old kid.
不
Is this some sort of a joke?
不是開玩笑的
就在那小子那裡
No, no joke.
嗨
No funny stuff, Jackie.
The kid's got it.
那小子想要一輛車
Hi, fellas.
The kid just wanted a car.
督爺只想要回他的地毯
我並不貪心
All the Dude ever wanted
was his rug back.
它真的...
I'm not greedy.
對我很重要
It really...
督爺接受了黑暗的洗禮
tied the room together.
就像在沒有月亮的
晚上在海上航行
Darkness washed over the Dude.
Darker than
a black steer's tookus
進入一個無底洞
on a moonless prairie night.
There was no bottom.
傑奇.特裡赫姆出品
主演:督爺
莫迪.勒保斯基
保齡情史
烙印!
Branded!
這是你唯一的身份證明?
我知道我的權力
Is this your only I. D?
你什麼也不知道,勒保斯基
I know my rights, man.
我要一個律師
我要...
- You don't know shit, Lebowski.
- I want a fucking lawyer, man.
比爾.克斯勒
I want... Bill Kunstler, man...
或者朗恩.庫奇
特裡赫姆先生告訴我們...
他將你從派對裡趕出去
or Ron Coobie.
Mr Treehorn tells us
你喝醉了,並失去控制
that he had to eject you
from his garden party,
特裡赫姆先生將事物
當作女人一般對待
that you were drunk
and abusive.
Mr Treehorn treats objects
like women, man.
特裡赫姆先生
對這城市的貢獻很大
但你什麼貢獻也沒有
勒保斯基
Mr Treehorn draws
a lot of water in this town.
這裡有一個
寧靜的海灘社區
You don't draw shit, Lebowski.
而我要保證它的寧靜
We got a nice quiet
little beach community here,
我說明白一點
and I aim to keep it
nice and quiet.
我不喜歡你在這裡搞事
騷擾這裡的市民,勒保斯基
So let me make something plain.
我不喜歡你的鳥名字
I don't like you sucking around,
不喜歡你的鳥臉
bothering our citizens,
Lebowski.
不喜歡你的鳥行為
I don't like your jerk... off name,
我不喜歡你...
I don't like your jerk... off face,
怪胎
I don't like
your jerk... off behaviour,
and I don't like you... Jerk... off.
聽明白了嗎?
對不起,我沒聽到
Do I make myself clear?
I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.
該死的法西斯!
遠離馬裡布,勒保斯基!
Fucking fascist!
遠離馬裡布,混蛋!
Stay out of Malibu, Lebowski!
將你的屁股從
我的社區帶走
Stay out of Malibu, deadbeat!
Keep your ugly goldbricking ass
out of my beach community.
天啊...
換個頻道好嗎?
去你的!如果你
不喜歡我的音樂
Jesus... Man, could you
change the channel.
就別坐我的車!
我真的...
我要將你踢出去
If you don't like my music,
get your own fucking cab!
我今晚真的很倒霉啊
I'll pull over
and kick your ass out.
我討厭老鷹樂隊
I had a rough night,
and I hate the fucking Eagles.
滾出去!
出去!
嗨!
Out of my fucking cab!
Out! Get...
嗨!
Hey... man!
Man, hey!
天啊
Oh... Jesus.
傑弗裡
莫迪?
Jeffrey.
愛我吧
Maude?
那是我的浴袍啊
Love me.
告訴我你的過去吧,傑弗裡
Uh, that's my robe.
其實沒太多好說的
Tell me about yourself, Jeffrey.
我曾經是休倫湖港口
聲明的創作者之一
Well, not much to tell.
I, um, I was one of the authors
休倫湖港口聲明的原本
of the Port Huron statement.
不是那經過
妥協的第二版本
The original
Port Huron statement.
Not the compromised
second draft.
然後...
你聽說過西雅圖七俠嗎?
Uh, and then I, uh,
那就是我
you ever hear of the Seattle 7?
還有另外6個人...
That was me.
And, um, the six other guys.
後來做了一段時間音樂
Um... and then,
ah, music business briefly.
是嗎?
是啊,重金屬...
搖滾樂
- Yeah, a roadie for Metallica.
- Oh.
一幫傻瓜
- "Speed of Sound" tour.
- Mm... hmm.
然後
做些這個,做些那個
Bunch of assholes.
Uh, and then, you know,
我的事業最近停滯了
a little of this,
a little of that.
你有什麼消遣?
My career's slowed down
a little lately.
通常是打保齡和開車兜風
What do you do for recreation?
Oh, the usual.
Bowl, drive around.
偶然吃點迷幻藥
The occasional acid flashback.
你的屋子怎麼了?
傑奇.特裡赫姆
將這裡翻了一遍
他以為我有你父親的錢
What happened to your house?
Oh, Jackie Treehorn
trashed the place.
他在我不在
這裡的時候干的
He thought I had
your father's money.
要雞尾酒嗎?
不了,謝謝
He got me out of the way
while he looked for it.
那不是我父親的錢
是基金會的
- Cocktail?
- No, thanks.
為什麼他覺得你有呢?
It's not my father's money.
It's the Foundation's.
誰知道呢?
那個中學生拉裡
Why did he think you have it?
And who does?
真是個該死的臭小子
這是一個非常
複雜的案子,莫迪
Larry Sellers,
this high school kid.
Real fucking brat.
很多曲折
You know, this is a very
complicated case, Maude.
不幸的是
我要遵守一個
很嚴格的...
Lotta ins, lotta outs.
You know, fortunately,
藥物管理規則
不讓自己放縱
I'm adhering
to a pretty strict...
你知道的
已經非常接近
你父親的錢了
drug regiment to keep
my mind, you know,
我一直在說那是
基金會的錢
uh, limber, you know.
我父親沒錢的
Very close
to your father's money.
It's the Foundation's money.
Father doesn't have any.
你說什麼?他很富有啊
不,那些是我母親的遺產
What are you talking about?
He's loaded.
不,他是管理者...
我們的確讓他管理
其中一間公司
No, no, the wealth
was all mother's.
但他做得很不好
No, he runs stuff, uh...
不,你知道的
他現在幫助管理
一個慈善機構
We did let him run a company,
but he didn't do very well.
而我給他合理的養老金
- No, he's...
- He administers the charities,
他自己沒錢的
and I give him
a reasonable allowance.
我知道他介紹自己的方式
他的缺點就是虛榮
He has no money of his own.
於是,那個婊子...
I know how he presents himself.
Father's weakness is vanity.
你認為他...
- Hence, the slut.
- Uh, do you think he, uh...
怎麼了?你在做瑜珈
這樣可以增加懷孕的機會
What is that, yoga?
增加?
It increases
the chances of conception.
是啊
你以為那是為什麼?
玩遊戲嗎?
- Increases?
- Well, yes.
我要生孩子
What did you think this
was about? Fun and games?
讓我...
I want a child.
讓我解釋一下我自己
OK, yeah, OK, but let me...
傑弗裡
我不需要一個搭檔
Let me explain
something about the Dude.
事實上我不想要一個父親
Look, Jeffrey,
I don't want a partner.
或者和我有利害關係的人
I don't want the father
to be someone I have to see,
我要自己養育我的孩子
所以那個醫生...
or who has any interest
in raising the child himself.
沒錯.你的臉怎麼了?
Oh, so that doctor...
傑奇.特裡赫姆
也那樣打你嗎?
Exactly.
不,是那個該死的
馬裡布警察
Now, what happened to your face?
Did Jackie Treehorn
do that as well?
一個反動分子
No, uh, it was
the Chief of Police of Malibu.
你的父親...
A real reactionary.
So, your father...
我明白了
什麼?
我對這案子的想法...
- Yeah, I get it. Yeah, yeah.
- What?
已經很清楚了,你父親
Oh, man, my thinking
about this case
had become very uptight.
Yeah, your father.
傑弗裡,你在說什麼?
Jeffrey,
what are you talking about?
傑弗裡!
沃爾特,如果你在...
快拿起電話
Jeffrey!
Walter, if you're there,
這是急事
pick up the fucking phone.
Come on.
督爺?
沃爾特,我在家
Pick it up, man,
this is an emergency.
我要你馬上開車來接我
我不能開車
督爺,今天是安息日
'Dude? '
I'm at my place. I need you
to come and pick me up.
-什麼?-安息日
-什麼?-安息日
'I can't drive, Dude,
it's Erev Shabbos.'
我不能開車!
本來聽電影也不行的
- What?
- 'Erev Shabbos.'
除非是急事
- 'I can't drive.'
- Man!
這就是急事啊
我知道,所以我聽了電話
'I'm not supposed
to pick up the phone
- 'unless it's an emergency.'
- This is a fucking emergency!
沃爾特,你這個混蛋
我們得去帕薩裡那
'That's why
I picked up the phone.'
快來接我,不然我退出
那該死的保齡球賽
Walter, you fuck,
we gotta go to Pasadena.
Pick me up
or I'm off the bowling team.
快出來
出來!
Get out of that
fucking car, man.
出來
Get out of that fucking car!
出來...
Get the fuck out
of the car, man.
你到底是誰?
別緊張
Get out of the fucking...
我無意傷害你
Who the fuck are you, man?
你到底是誰?
Easy, man. Relax, man.
No physical harm intended.
為什麼跟蹤我?
說啊,混蛋
我是希姆斯兄弟的人
Who the fuck are you?
Why are you following me around?
希姆斯兄弟?
Come on, fuckhead.
Relax, man.
I'm a brother Seamus.
像那些愛爾蘭僧人?
你在說什麼鬼話?
Brother Seamus?
Like an Irish monk?
我叫達菲諾
像你一樣是個私家偵探
What the fuck are you
talking about?
什麼?
My name is Da Fino. I'm a
private snoop, like you, man.
偵探
我很欣賞你的工作
- What?
- A dick, man.
兩頭都應付得了
還能和美人消魂
Let me tell you something.
I dig your work.
我不是...
Playing one side
against the other.
別靠近我的女性朋友
In bed with everybody.
Fabulous stuff.
我不是來找你的
特別女朋友麻煩
I'm not! Fuck it.
Just stay away
from my lady friend.
她不是我的特別女朋友
她是個大麻煩
我只是幫助她懷孕
I'm not messing
with your special lady.
我不是...
She's not my special lady.
你為誰工作?
勒保斯基?
I'm just helping her conceive.
傑奇.特裡赫姆?
- I'm not...
- Who are you working for?
克納森
Lebowski? Jackie Treehorn?
克納森是什麼鬼東西?
The Knutsens.
克納森家要
尋找他們的女兒
The... who the fuck
are the Knutsens?
The Knutsens.
It's a wandering... daughter job.
邦妮.勒保斯基
她的真名叫弗恩.克納森
Bunny Lebowski, man.
她父母想找她
Her real name is Fawn Knutsen.
天啊
Her parents want her back.
她一年前離家出走了
Jesus fucking Christ.
克納森家說找到她時
要給她看這些
Crazy, huh? Ran away
about a year ago.
家族的農場
The Knutsens told me to
show her this when I found her.
在明尼蘇達州的
他們覺得這個會讓她思鄉
It's the family farm
outside of Moorhead, Minnesota.
他們怎麼還能保留那農場?
They think it'll
make her homesick.
她被綁架了
How are you gonna keep 'em down
once they've seen Karl Hungus?
也許不是的
但是她肯定不在附近
- She's been kidnapped, Da Fino.
- Oh, man.
也許我們可以交換信息
Maybe not, but she's not around.
Hey, maybe you and me
could pool our resources.
職業道德啊
明白我的意思嗎?
Trade information.
Professional courtesy.
明白,你消失吧
不要靠近我的...
Compeers, you know what I mean?
麻煩的女性朋友
Yeah, yeah, I get it.
Fuck off, Da Fino.
And stay away from my special...
from my fucking
lady friend, man.
我要橘子薄餅
Ze lingonberry pancakes.
[德語]
橘子薄餅
Lingonberry pancakes.
橘子薄餅
[德語]
Sree pigs in blanket.
[德語]
她要橘子薄餅
[德語]
She has lingonberry pancakes.
我們都搞砸了
不能發工資
那些綁架的人都被惹怒了
We totally fucked it up, man.
勒保斯基經常對我大喊
We fucked up his payoff,
we pissed off the kidnappers,
但他什麼也沒做
有時候...
and Lebowski, he yelled at me
but he didn't do anything, huh?
我是說,既然他知道
我什麼也做不了
Well, sometimes
it's a cathartic...
為什麼要我去找她老婆回來?
因為他不想她回來
If he knows I'm a fuck... up,
why does he ask me
to get his wife back?
他已經對她沒興趣了
Because he doesn't
want her back.
那些都是演戲的
但為什麼他要拿出
一百萬呢?
He's had enough.
He no longer digs her.
他知道我們不會把
那一百萬交給綁匪
But then,
why doesn't he give a shit
但他從沒要求拿回來
about his million bucks?
那箱子裡面根本
沒有一百萬
I mean, he knows we never
handed off his briefcase,
but he never asked for it back.
那箱子是空的
The million bucks was
never in the briefcase.
那混蛋想他們殺了她
The briefcase was
fucking empty, man.
你扔出去的是一個誘餌
The asshole was hoping
that they would kill her.
但為什麼要那麼急呢?
You threw out a ringer
for a ringer.
我知道你在說什麼,督爺
How does
this add up to an emergency?
他留著那筆錢
Huh?
我要說的是...
I see what you're
getting at, Dude,
今天是安息日
只是關乎人命的
事情才能去做
he kept the money.
My point is...
here we are, it's Shabbos,
which I'm allowed to break
別吹牛了好嗎,沃爾特?
你根本不是猶太人
only if it's a matter
of life or death.
你在說什麼?
你是個波蘭天主教徒
Come off it.
You're not even fucking Jewish.
你在說什麼?
What the fuck
are you talking about?
我和辛迪雅結婚後就轉變了
督爺
You're fucking Polish... Catholic.
你知道的
I converted when I married
Cynthia. Come on.
5年前你們就離婚了
你們離婚之後
- Yeah, yeah.
- You know this.
你就改變了信仰?
不做猶太人了?
Five years ago,
you were divorced.
So when you get divorced,
you return your library card?
這是公路嗎?
我是一個猶太人
You get a new licence?
You stop being Jewish?
這都是因為辛迪雅
而產生的病態
- This is the driveway.
- I'm Jewish as fucking Tevy�.
照顧她留下的小狗...
Man, it's all a part
of your sick Cynthia thing.
去那些猶太人集會...
你還活在你的過去
Taking care of her fucking dog.
Going to her fucking synagogue.
那是有3000年
歷史的傳統
You're living in the past.
你說得對
我還活在過去!
3,000 years
of beautiful tradition
from Moses to Sandy Koufax,
天啊
damn right I'm living
in the fucking past! I... Jesus.
怎麼了?
What the hell happened?
她在哪裡?
去了探訪朋友
她剛離開的
沒告訴我們
Where was she, man?
我想那該死的虛無
主義者知道她在哪裡
Visiting friends
in Palm Springs.
督爺,她沒綁架自己
She just left.
Never bothered to tell us.
這位是誰,督爺?
I guess the nihilist
knew where she was.
我是個退伍軍人
She never
even kidnapped herself.
他不應該來這裡的,督爺
- Who is this gentleman, Dude?
- Who am I? A fucking veteran.
他現在非常生氣
You shouldn't go in, Dude.
He's very angry.
你好
她回來了,不是因為你們
So, man...
錢在哪裡,勒保斯基?
So, she's back,
no thanks to you.
從那基金會提出來的一百萬!
- Where's the fucking money?
- A million bucks
你是個人渣!
他到底是誰?
from fucking needy little
urban achievers! You are scum!
我是誰?
我是一個非常討厭
你那些詭計的人
- Who the hell is he?
- Who am I?
他知道那箱子是空的
我們知道你自己
留下了那一百萬
I'm the guy that's gonna kick
your goldbricking ass!
你們有你的故事
我有我的故事
The briefcase was empty.
You kept the money for yourself.
我說我把錢委託給你們了
而你們偷走了
如果我們想過的話
You have your story,
I have mine.
I entrusted the money
to you, and you stole it.
你那些該死的錢!
你以為邦妮被綁架了
As if we would ever
take your bullshit money!
而你很高興
可以用作讓錢消失的借口
You thought Bunny had been
kidnapped, and you were glad.
你需要的只是
一個動手的傻子
你這個人渣!
You could make
some money disappear.
You needed was a sap
to pin it on.
這裡有一個失敗者
You just met me.
You... human paraquat!
一個沒人理會的傢伙
You figured,
"Oh, here's a loser."
你不是嗎?
Somebody the square community
won't give a shit about.
我是,不過...
- Well, aren't you?
- Well, yeah, but...
你們都出去
看那該死的混蛋,督爺
還假扮成百萬富翁
你們這些遊民
給我滾出去!
Get out, both of you.
Look at that phony.
Pretending to be a millionaire.
讓我告訴你別的事情
我見過很多脊椎炎的
例子,督爺
Out of this house now, you bums!
這傢伙是假冒的
Let me tell you something.
該死的騙子
I've seen
a lot of spinals, Dude,
別靠近我!
and this guy's a fake.
A fucking goldbricker.
他可以走路的
沒什麼比這個更加肯定了
- Stay away from me!
- This guy fucking walks.
走開!
沃爾特,他是個殘廢
- I've never been more certain.
- Stay away!
快啊
走開!
Walter, for Christ's sake,
man, he's a cripple.
放他下來吧!
我會的,督爺!
Get away from me!
來吧!
- Put him down, man!
- Yeah, I'll put him down!
Rauss! Achtung, baby!
幫我放他回去椅子上面
Come on, help me
put him back in his chair.
你會看到一些坦克大戰的
但在沙漠戰爭和
叢林戰爭非常不一樣
Sure, you'll see
some tank battles.
這是步兵的戰鬥
Fighting in desert
is very different
所以這個應該...
from fighting in jungle.
'Nam was a foot soldier's war,
非常簡單
我有一支M16
whereas this thing should,
you know, be a piece of cake.
而不是一輛坦克
我和查理面對面
I mean, I had an M16 Jacko,
not an Abrams fucking tank.
那才是戰役
Me and Charlie,
eyeball to eyeball.
那穿黑色長袍的傢伙,督爺
- Yeah.
- That's fuckin' combat.
是個該死的對手
The man in
the black pyjamas, Dude.
誰穿著長袍,沃爾特?
閉嘴,多尼
Worthy fuckin' adversary.
我們有的只是...
- Who's in pyjamas, Walter?
- Shut the fuck up, Donny.
很多遊民用過的毛巾
想弄翻那蘇軍的坦克
Whereas, what we have here...
這些不值得...
Fig... eaters wearing
towels on their heads,
這是說廢話的日子嗎?
trying to find reverse
on a Soviet tank.
- This... this is not a worthy...
- Hey!
什麼胡說八道的!
我不在乎!
What's this day... of... rest shit?
對我來說不重要
但你們騙不了我
What's this bullshit?!
I don't fuckin' care!
你們也許能欺騙
管理辦公室的笨蛋
It don't matter to Jesus.
But you not fooling me, man.
但你騙不了我
那些都是胡話
You might fool
the league office,
but you don't fool Jesus.
真可笑!
It's bush league
psyche... out stuff.
我本來可以
在週六收拾你們的
Laughable, man.
現在改成下週三也無所謂
I would have fucked you
in the ass Saturday.
你們週三有約了
I'll fuck you in the ass
next Wednesday instead.
Whoo! You got a date
Wednesday, baby.
他在胡說
大亞洲的概念...
很多學者對此有爭議
He's cracking.
但在14世紀...
The whole concept of Asia.
Many learned men
have disputed this,
but in the 14th Century,
the Rabahm, he...
他們總算成功了
他們毀了我的車
我們要錢,勒保斯基
Well, they finally did it.
They killed my fucking car.
不然我們就殺了那女孩
We want ze money, Lebowski.
你似乎忘記了我們的
交易了,勒保斯基
Ja, otherwise, we kill ze girl.
那女孩不在你們手上,混蛋
Ja, it seems you have
forgotten our little deal.
我們知道的
You don't have
the fucking girl, dipshit.
他們是納粹嗎,沃爾特?
不,多尼,他們只是
些虛無主義者
< We know you never did.
沒什麼要害怕的
Are these the Nazis?
我們還是要錢
No, nihilists.
Nothing to be afraid of.
否則我們要對付你
Ve don't care. Ve still
want the money, Lebowski,
你們三個去死吧
沒有人質就沒有贖金
or we'll fuck you up.
Fuck you.
Fuck the three of yous.
贖金就是這樣的
No, without a hostage,
there is no ransom.
那些是規矩
他女朋友獻出了一隻腳趾
That's what ransom is.
Those are the fucking rules.
她以為我們可以
拿到一百萬的
His girlfriend gave up her toe.
這不公平
公平?
那該死的傢伙是誰?
She zought
we'd be getting $1 million.
你們這些娘娘腔的
It's not fair.
沃爾特,冷靜點
Fair? Who's the fucking
nihilist around here,
根本就沒什麼錢
you bunch of fucking crybabies.
老勒保斯基給了
我一個空箱子
Cool it, Walter. Hey, look, pal,
there never was any money.
你們去找他算帳吧
是啊,我還要拿回我的內褲
The big Lebowski
gave me an empty briefcase,
他們要傷害我們嗎,沃爾特?
so take it up with him, man.
不,多尼,他們都是懦夫
I would like my undies back.
那我們拿走你們身上的錢
- Are these guys gonna hurt us?
- No, these men are cowards.
這樣就扯平了
OK, so we take
ze money you have on you
去你的
不,沃爾特,來吧
and we calls it even.
解決問題就算了
Fuck you.
不,我的東西就是我的
沃爾特
No, Walter, come on.
We're ending this cheap, man.
別耍花樣
好了,我有...
- No, what's mine is mine.
- Come on, Walter.
差不多5塊
- No funny stuff.
- All right, I got...
我有18塊
我的東西就是我的
我們要拿走你們的錢
- uh, 4 bucks, almost 5.
- I got $18.
What's mine is mine.
過來拿啊
We fuck you up, man.
We takes the money.
我們要收拾你們
Come and get it.
做給我看啊,混蛋
去你的
We fuck you up.
沃爾特,他有鋼鋸啊
有9只腳趾的女人的男朋友
Show me what you got, nihilist.
I fuck you.
去你的!
Come on, he's got a sword.
去你的!
Dipshit with a nine... toed woman.
Fuck you! Fuck you!
I fuck you, I!
別緊張
這裡有4塊
Take it easy, man.
Here's the $4.
我有一隻保齡球
I got a fucking ball, man.
反猶太人!
我要殺了你
我要殺了你
Anti... Semite!
去你的!
I fuck you in ze ass.
去你的!
I fuck you! I fuck you!
I fuck you! I fuck you!
有人倒下了,督爺
We got a man down, Dude.
天啊,他們開槍了
不,督爺
他們開槍射了多尼?
沒有開槍
God, they shot him, man.
心臟病發
- No, Dude.
- They shot Donny?
找救護兵,督爺
There weren't any shots fired.
It's a heart attack.
我也想去,但我也負傷了
Call the medics, Dude.
堅持住,夥計,你行的
I'd go myself, but I'm
pumping blood. Might pass out.
救援就到了
Rest easy, good buddy,
you're doing fine.
We got help choppering in.
你們就是死者的朋友?
是的
我是弗朗西斯.杜納裡
很高興見到你們
Hello, gentlemen.
You are the bereaved?
傑弗裡.勒保斯基
Yeah, man.
沃爾特.索布查克
Francis Donnelly.
Pleased to meet you.
應該是督爺
Jeff Lebowski.
什麼?
Walter Sobchak.
沒什麼
The Dude, actually, is, uh...
我知道你們要帶走骨灰
- Excuse me?
- Oh, nothing.
Yes, I understand
you're taking away the remains.
是的
已經放進了骨灰罐
Yeah.
這應該用信用卡結帳吧?
We have the urn.
I assume this is credit card.
是的
Yeah.
這是什麼?
骨灰罐的錢
沒必要了
我們要將骨灰撒開
What's this?
好的
That's for the urn.
Don't need it.
We're scattering the ashes.
但是...
我們必須用一個
容器轉交給你們
Yes, so we were informed.
However, we must, of course,
transmit the remains
to you in a receptacle.
要180美金啊
這是我們最低價的容器了
This is $180.
-我們能否...-180美金?
It is our most...
modestly priced receptacle.
最高可達3000
- Can we just, uh...
- $180?
我們...
可以借用一下嗎?
- They range up to 3,000.
- Uh, we're, uh, ahem...
先生,這裡是太平間
不是租借的地方
Can't we just
rent it from you?
我們只是要將骨灰撒開!
Sir, this is a mortuary,
not a rental house.
別當我們是傻瓜!
先生,請小聲一點
We're scattering the ashes!
Just because we're bereaved,
doesn't make us saps!
你們有沒有...
其他東西給我們放骨灰的嗎?
Sir, please, lower your voices.
Man, don't you have, you know,
這是我們最低價的容器了
something else we could
put him in, you know?
該死的!
That is our most...
modestly priced receptacle.
這附近有超市嗎?
Goddamn it!
Is there a Ralph's around here?
多尼是一個保齡球好手
也是一個好人
他是我們的同伴
Donny was a good bowler
and a good man.
一個熱愛保齡的男人
He was one of us.
他喜歡衝浪
熱愛南加州的海灘
He was a man who loved
the outdoors... and bowling.
從聖荷拉一直到普裡斯莫
As a surfer,
he explored the beaches
of Southern California,
from La Jolla to Leo Carrillo
and up to Pismo.
他在自己的黃金時期
離開了人世
He died... he died as so
many men of his generation,
真主,以你的智慧
你帶走了他
正如你帶走了其他年輕人
before his time.
In your wisdom, Lord,
you took him.
在科沙,在蘭多
As you took so many bright,
flowering young men
還有364山
at Khe Sanh, at Lan Doc,
and Hill 364.
那些年輕人獻出了生命
多尼也如此
These young men
gave their lives.
熱愛保齡的多尼
So did Donny.
Donny who loved bowling.
多尼.卡拉波索斯
And so...
根據我們所想到的
你最後的願望
Theodore Donald Karabotsos,
in accordance
with what we think
我們將你的骨灰
your dying wishes
might well have been,
投入太平洋的懷抱
we commit your final,
mortal remains
這是你最喜愛的海洋
to the bosom
of the Pacific Ocean,
永別了,朋友
which you loved so well.
Goodnight, sweet prince.
該死的
督爺,對不起
Shit.
該死的大風
Oh, shit, Dude, I'm sorry.
沃爾特
你這個混蛋!
- Goddamn wind.
- Goddamn it, Walter.
督爺,對不起
你做什麼都那麼無稽
對不起,那是意外
- You fucking asshole!
- Dude, I'm sorry.
那些越戰的鬼話是什麼?
Everything's
a fucking travesty with you.
為什麼所有事情
都和越南拉上關係?
Sorry. It was an accident.
你在說什麼鬼話?
What was that shit
about Vietnam?
What does anything
have to do with Vietnam?
督爺,對不起
What the fuck
were you talking about?
你...
Dude, I'm sorry.
Fuckin'...
去你的,沃爾特
督爺,別說了
Fuck, Walter.
Come on, Dude.
Hey, fuck it, man.
我們去打保齡吧
Let's go bowling.
2份蘇打水,加裡
祝你們明天好運
好的,謝謝
多尼的事我很難過
Two oat sodas, Gary.
是啊
- Good luck tomorrow.
- Yeah, thanks, man.
I'm sorry to hear about Donny.
世事難料
有時候...
Oh, well, yeah, you know,
sometimes you eat the bar
and sometimes, you know...
你好啊,督爺
我還想著能否再見到你
Hey, man!
我沒錯過半決賽吧?
Howdy doo, Dude.
最近怎麼了?
I wondered if I'd see you again.
還是那樣
I wouldn't miss the semis.
How have things been going?
有起有伏
是啊
謝謝
Strikes and gutters,
ups and downs.
- Sure. I gotcha.
- Yeah.
我得回去了,保重
好的,督爺.別緊張啊
Thanks, Gary.
好的
Well, take care, man.
Gotta get back.
我知道你能成功的
當然了,督爺可以承受的
- Sure. Take it easy, Dude.
- Oh, yeah.
I know that you will.
Yeah, well, the Dude abides.
督爺可以承受的
The Dude abides.
不知道你是否這樣
但我從中得到安慰
看到督爺一切如常
I don't know about you,
but I take comfort in that.
這讓人很高興
It's good knowing
he's out there, the Dude.
希望他能打進決賽
Takin' her easy
for all us sinners.
Shoosh.
將對手打個落花流水
I sure hope he makes the finals.
Well, that about does her.
Wraps her all up.
督爺和沃爾特的
狀況似乎不錯
這也是一個不錯的故事
Things seem to have worked out
good for the Dude and Walter.
你說不是嗎?
讓我當眾大笑
It was a pretty good story,
don't you think?
只是偶然這樣
Made me laugh to beat the band.
我不想看到多尼離開
Parts, anyway.
但我知道...
I didn't like seeing Donny go.
一個小勒保斯基
就要出現了
But then I happen to know
我想這就是人類喜劇
流傳下來的方式
that there's
a little Lebowski on the way.
I guess that's how
the whole darn human comedy
一代接一代
keeps perpetuating itself
就如西部的大馬車...
橫跨大沙漠...
down through the generations.
Westward the wagons,
看看我
across the sands
of time until we...
又開始長篇大論了
希望你們喜歡這個故事
Oh, look at me.
I'm ramblin' again.
在保齡球場上再見
Well, I hope you folks
enjoyed yourselves.
再給我一杯撒爾沙酒好嗎?
Catch ya later on
down the trail.
Say, friend, you got any more
of that good Sarsaparilla?
