1
00:02:04,561 --> 00:02:07,688
<i>People always ask me
if I know Tyler Durden.</i>

2
00:02:08,632 --> 00:02:09,656
Three minutes.

3
00:02:09,733 --> 00:02:12,065
This is it. Ground zero.

4
00:02:12,135 --> 00:02:15,833
Do you have a speech for the occasion?

5
00:02:15,907 --> 00:02:19,467
<i>With a gun barrel between your teeth,
you speak only in vowels.</i>

6
00:02:19,542 --> 00:02:21,635
I can't think of anything.

7
00:02:21,711 --> 00:02:25,580
<i>For a second, I forget about
Tyler's controlled demolition thing</i>

8
00:02:25,683 --> 00:02:27,843
<i>and I wonder how clean that gun is.</i>

9
00:02:27,918 --> 00:02:29,977
It's getting exciting now.

10
00:02:30,086 --> 00:02:33,250
<i>That old thing,
how you always hurt the one you love.</i>

11
00:02:33,357 --> 00:02:35,450
<i>Well, it works both ways.</i>

12
00:02:35,526 --> 00:02:39,792
<i>We have front-row seats
for this theater of mass destruction.</i>

13
00:02:39,897 --> 00:02:42,661
<i>The Demolitions Committee
of Project Mayhem</i>

14
00:02:42,733 --> 00:02:46,170
<i>wrapped the foundations
of 12 buildings with explosives.</i>

15
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:50,339
<i>In two minutes,
primary charges will blow base charges</i>

16
00:02:50,408 --> 00:02:53,776
<i>and a few blocks will be reduced
to smouldering rubble.</i>

17
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:56,905
<i>I know this because Tyler knows this.</i>

18
00:02:56,982 --> 00:03:00,384
Two and a half.
Think of everything we've accomplished.

19
00:03:00,486 --> 00:03:05,821
<i>Suddenly I realize that all of this,
the gun, the bombs, the revolution,</i>

20
00:03:05,924 --> 00:03:09,190
<i>has got something to do
with a girl named Marla Singer.</i>

21
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:14,096
<i>Bob. Bob had bitch tits.</i>

22
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:18,365
<i>This was a support group
for men with testicular cancer.</i>

23
00:03:18,438 --> 00:03:21,737
<i>The big moosie slobbering all over me,
that was Bob.</i>

24
00:03:21,808 --> 00:03:23,969
We're still men.

25
00:03:24,043 --> 00:03:26,238
Yes, we're men.

26
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:28,540
Men is what we are.

27
00:03:28,614 --> 00:03:32,051
<i>Bob had had his testicles removed.
Then hormone therapy.</i>

28
00:03:32,152 --> 00:03:35,951
<i>He developed bitch tits because
his testosterone was too high</i>

29
00:03:36,022 --> 00:03:38,150
<i>and his body upped the oestrogen.</i>

30
00:03:38,225 --> 00:03:41,956
<i>- That was where I fit...
- They'll have to drain my pecs again.</i>

31
00:03:42,029 --> 00:03:44,521
<i>..between those huge sweating tits</i>

32
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:48,830
<i>that hung enormous,
the way you'd think of God's as big.</i>

33
00:03:48,936 --> 00:03:51,131
OK, you cry now.

34
00:03:51,205 --> 00:03:53,766
<i>No, wait. Back up. Let me start earlier.</i>

35
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:57,773
<i>For six months, I couldn't sleep.</i>

36
00:03:57,845 --> 00:04:00,406
<i>I couldn't sleep.</i>

37
00:04:00,482 --> 00:04:02,643
<i>With insomnia, nothing's real.</i>

38
00:04:02,751 --> 00:04:04,810
<i>Everything's far away.</i>

39
00:04:05,754 --> 00:04:08,086
<i>Everything's a copy of a copy</i>

40
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:10,214
<i>of a copy.</i>

41
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:18,089
<i>When deep space exploration ramps up,
it'll be the corporations that name everything.</i>

42
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:20,258
<i>The IBM Stellar Sphere.</i>

43
00:04:20,602 --> 00:04:22,662
<i>The Microsoft Galaxy.</i>

44
00:04:22,772 --> 00:04:24,831
<i>The Planet Starbucks.</i>

45
00:04:25,408 --> 00:04:28,469
I need you out of town this week
to cover some red flags.

46
00:04:28,577 --> 00:04:32,104
<i>It must have been Tuesday.
He had on his cornflower blue tie.</i>

47
00:04:32,214 --> 00:04:36,811
You want me to deprioritize my reports
until you advise of a status upgrade?

48
00:04:36,887 --> 00:04:41,482
Prioritize these. Here's your flight coupons.
Call me if there's any snags.

49
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:45,459
<i>He was full of pep.
Must have had his grande latte enema.</i>

50
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:51,695
<i>Like so many others, I had become
a slave to the Ikea nesting instinct.</i>

51
00:04:51,802 --> 00:04:54,134
Yes. I'd like to order

52
00:04:54,237 --> 00:04:56,501
the Erika Pekkari dust ruffles.

53
00:04:56,606 --> 00:04:58,700
<i>- Please hold.
- Anything clever,</i>

54
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:03,143
<i>like a coffee table in the shape of a yin-yang,
I had to have it.</i>

55
00:05:04,214 --> 00:05:06,615
<i>The Klipsk personal office unit.</i>

56
00:05:06,684 --> 00:05:08,948
<i>The Hovetrekke home exerbike.</i>

57
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,881
<i>Or the Ohamshab sofa
with the Strinne green stripe pattern.</i>

58
00:05:12,957 --> 00:05:18,452
<i>Even the Ryslampa wire lamps of
environmentally-friendly unbleached paper.</i>

59
00:05:18,529 --> 00:05:21,328
<i>I'd flip through catalogues and wonder</i>

60
00:05:21,467 --> 00:05:24,492
<i>"What kind of dining set
defines me as a person?"</i>

61
00:05:24,569 --> 00:05:29,337
<i>I had it all. Even the glass dishes
with tiny bubbles and imperfections,</i>

62
00:05:29,475 --> 00:05:34,538
<i>proof that they were crafted by the honest,
hard-working, indigenous peoples of...</i>

63
00:05:34,646 --> 00:05:37,581
<i>- Please hold.
- ..wherever.</i>

64
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:40,176
<i>We used to read pornography.</i>

65
00:05:40,285 --> 00:05:43,119
<i>Now it was the Horchow collection.</i>

66
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:46,589
- No. You can't die of insomnia.
- What about narcolepsy?

67
00:05:46,692 --> 00:05:49,059
I nod off, I wake up in strange places.

68
00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:51,188
I have no idea how I got there.

69
00:05:51,297 --> 00:05:55,097
- You need to lighten up.
- Can you please just give me something?

70
00:05:55,168 --> 00:05:58,797
<i>Red and blue Tuinals, lipstick-red Seconals...</i>

71
00:05:59,205 --> 00:06:02,663
No. You need healthy, natural sleep.

72
00:06:03,376 --> 00:06:06,869
Chew some valerian root
and get more exercise.

73
00:06:08,915 --> 00:06:10,975
Hey, come on.

74
00:06:11,085 --> 00:06:13,144
- I'm in pain.
- You wanna see pain?

75
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,780
Swing by First Methodist, Tuesday nights.

76
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:18,950
See the guys with testicular cancer.

77
00:06:19,026 --> 00:06:21,119
That's pain.

78
00:06:37,012 --> 00:06:40,413
I always wanted three kids...
two boys and a girl.

79
00:06:40,549 --> 00:06:42,915
Mindy wanted two girls and a boy.

80
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:46,987
We never could agree on anything.

81
00:06:47,322 --> 00:06:49,120
Well, I... She...

82
00:06:49,192 --> 00:06:51,716
She had her first child last week.

83
00:06:51,793 --> 00:06:54,023
A girl.

84
00:06:54,129 --> 00:06:57,361
With... With her... With her new husband.

85
00:06:58,201 --> 00:07:00,260
Fuck!

86
00:07:01,604 --> 00:07:03,663
Thank God, you know...

87
00:07:03,773 --> 00:07:05,832
I'm glad for her.

88
00:07:06,642 --> 00:07:09,612
She deserves...

89
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:17,251
Everyone, let's thank Thomas
for sharing himself with us.

90
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:19,413
Thank you, Thomas.

91
00:07:19,556 --> 00:07:22,992
I look around this room,
and I see a lot of courage.

92
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,153
And that gives me strength.

93
00:07:25,229 --> 00:07:27,595
We give each other strength.

94
00:07:27,664 --> 00:07:29,962
It's time for the one-on-ones.

95
00:07:30,567 --> 00:07:34,971
So let's all of us follow Thomas's example
and really open ourselves up.

96
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:37,097
Could you find a partner?

97
00:07:39,277 --> 00:07:42,440
<i>And this is how I met the big moosie.</i>

98
00:07:44,115 --> 00:07:47,312
<i>His eyes already shrink-wrapped in tears.</i>

99
00:07:49,821 --> 00:07:52,619
<i>Knees together. Those awkward little steps.</i>

100
00:07:57,829 --> 00:07:59,922
- My name is Bob.
- Bob?

101
00:08:00,632 --> 00:08:02,897
<i>Bob had been a champion bodybuilder.</i>

102
00:08:03,002 --> 00:08:06,665
<i>You know that chest expansion programme
on late-night TV?</i>

103
00:08:06,739 --> 00:08:08,832
<i>That was his idea.</i>

104
00:08:08,907 --> 00:08:11,000
I was a juicer.

105
00:08:11,076 --> 00:08:13,203
You know, using steroids?

106
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:15,805
Diabonal and

107
00:08:15,882 --> 00:08:18,214
Wisterol.

108
00:08:18,285 --> 00:08:22,220
Oh, they use that on racehorses,
for Christ sakes.

109
00:08:22,721 --> 00:08:24,815
And now I'm bankrupt.

110
00:08:25,692 --> 00:08:27,751
I'm divorced.

111
00:08:28,495 --> 00:08:30,622
My two grown kids

112
00:08:31,464 --> 00:08:34,126
won't even return my phone calls.

113
00:08:34,234 --> 00:08:39,298
<i>Strangers with this kind of honesty
make me go a big, rubbery one.</i>

114
00:08:41,107 --> 00:08:43,166
Go ahead,... Cornelius.

115
00:08:43,276 --> 00:08:45,336
You can cry.

116
00:09:01,096 --> 00:09:04,531
<i>And then... something happened.
I let go.</i>

117
00:09:04,665 --> 00:09:06,724
That's really good.

118
00:09:06,801 --> 00:09:08,895
<i>Lost in oblivion.</i>

119
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:11,268
<i>Dark and silent and complete.</i>

120
00:09:14,275 --> 00:09:17,973
<i>I found freedom.
Losing all hope was freedom.</i>

121
00:09:20,415 --> 00:09:22,509
It's OK.

122
00:09:24,786 --> 00:09:26,981
<i>Babies don't sleep this well.</i>

123
00:09:30,593 --> 00:09:33,187
<i>I became addicted.</i>

124
00:09:46,909 --> 00:09:48,968
If I didn't say anything

125
00:09:49,045 --> 00:09:51,742
people always assumed the worst.

126
00:09:55,586 --> 00:09:58,646
They cried harder... then I cried harder.

127
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:12,229
Now we're going to open the green door,
the heart chakra...

128
00:10:12,336 --> 00:10:14,396
<i>I wasn't really dying.</i>

129
00:10:14,539 --> 00:10:17,269
<i>I wasn't host to cancer or parasites.</i>

130
00:10:18,209 --> 00:10:22,077
<i>I was the warm little center
that the life of this world crowded around.</i>

131
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:26,050
Imagine your pain
as a white ball of healing light.

132
00:10:26,151 --> 00:10:30,248
It moves over your body, healing you.

133
00:10:30,356 --> 00:10:33,847
Now keep this going. Remember to breathe

134
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:37,622
and step forward
through the back door of the room.

135
00:10:38,464 --> 00:10:40,591
Where does it lead?

136
00:10:40,699 --> 00:10:42,826
To your cave.

137
00:10:42,902 --> 00:10:44,802
Step forward

138
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:47,065
into your cave.

139
00:10:47,173 --> 00:10:49,232
That's right.

140
00:10:49,308 --> 00:10:52,800
You're going deeper into your cave.

141
00:10:53,479 --> 00:10:55,572
And you're going to find

142
00:10:55,648 --> 00:10:57,776
your power animal.

143
00:10:59,886 --> 00:11:01,217
Slide.

144
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,393
<i>Every evening I died.</i>

145
00:11:15,535 --> 00:11:18,231
<i>And every evening I was born again.</i>

146
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:20,899
<i>Resurrected.</i>

147
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:27,142
<i>Bob loved me because he thought
my testicles were removed too.</i>

148
00:11:27,248 --> 00:11:30,046
<i>Being there, pressed against his tits,</i>

149
00:11:30,117 --> 00:11:32,210
<i>ready to cry.</i>

150
00:11:32,286 --> 00:11:34,949
<i>This was my vacation.</i>

151
00:11:37,258 --> 00:11:38,885
<i>And she</i>

152
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,623
<i>ruined everything.</i>

153
00:11:41,697 --> 00:11:43,824
This is cancer, right?

154
00:11:46,702 --> 00:11:48,932
<i>This chick, Marla Singer,</i>

155
00:11:49,037 --> 00:11:51,665
<i>did not have testicular cancer.</i>

156
00:11:51,773 --> 00:11:53,866
<i>She was a liar.</i>

157
00:11:53,942 --> 00:11:56,035
<i>She had no diseases at all.</i>

158
00:11:56,112 --> 00:11:59,911
<i>I had seen her at Free And Clear,
my blood parasites group, Thursdays.</i>

159
00:11:59,982 --> 00:12:03,441
<i>Then at Hope,
my bimonthly sickle-cell circle.</i>

160
00:12:03,953 --> 00:12:08,913
<i>And again, at Seize The Day,
my tuberculosis, Friday night.</i>

161
00:12:10,058 --> 00:12:12,050
<i>Marla,</i>

162
00:12:12,128 --> 00:12:14,596
<i>the big tourist.</i>

163
00:12:14,697 --> 00:12:16,790
<i>Her lie reflected my lie.</i>

164
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:19,393
<i>And suddenly, I felt nothing.</i>

165
00:12:19,503 --> 00:12:23,131
<i>I couldn't cry. So once again,</i>

166
00:12:23,206 --> 00:12:25,299
<i>I couldn't sleep.</i>

167
00:12:36,287 --> 00:12:38,755
<i>Next group, after guided meditation,</i>

168
00:12:38,889 --> 00:12:42,290
<i>after we open our heart chakras,
when it's time to hug,</i>

169
00:12:42,359 --> 00:12:45,522
<i>I'm gonna grab that bitch,
Marla Singer, and scream.</i>

170
00:12:45,596 --> 00:12:49,590
Marla, you liar!
You big tourist, I need this! Now, get out!

171
00:12:51,703 --> 00:12:54,102
<i>I hadn't slept in four days.</i>

172
00:12:54,171 --> 00:12:56,037
<i>We'll just let that dry...</i>

173
00:12:56,141 --> 00:12:59,577
<i>When you have insomnia,
you're never really asleep.</i>

174
00:12:59,644 --> 00:13:02,135
<i>And you're never really awake.</i>

175
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:05,806
To begin tonight's communion,

176
00:13:05,917 --> 00:13:08,613
Chloe would like to say a few words.

177
00:13:08,753 --> 00:13:11,655
<i>Oh, yeah. Chloe.</i>

178
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:17,518
<i>Chloe looked the way Meryl Streep's skeleton
would look if you made it walk around</i>

179
00:13:17,597 --> 00:13:19,656
<i>being extra nice to everybody.</i>

180
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,225
Well, I'm still here.

181
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:24,730
But I don't know for how long.

182
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:28,665
That's as much certainty
as anyone can give me.

183
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:30,742
But I've got some good news.

184
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:34,575
I no longer have any fear of death.

185
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:42,251
But... I am in a pretty lonely place.

186
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,383
No-one will have sex with me.

187
00:13:46,561 --> 00:13:50,963
I'm so close to the end,
and all I want is to get laid for the last time.

188
00:13:51,565 --> 00:13:55,024
I have pornographic movies
in my apartment,

189
00:13:55,103 --> 00:13:58,800
- and lubricants and amyl nitrite.
- Thank you, Chloe.

190
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,634
Everyone, let's thank Chloe.

191
00:14:01,709 --> 00:14:03,870
Thank you, Chloe.

192
00:14:06,681 --> 00:14:10,515
Now, let's ready ourselves
for guided meditation.

193
00:14:11,653 --> 00:14:15,054
You're standing at the entrance of your cave.

194
00:14:15,523 --> 00:14:19,016
You step inside your cave and you walk...

195
00:14:19,094 --> 00:14:22,221
<i>If I did have a tumor, I'd name it Marla.</i>

196
00:14:23,265 --> 00:14:25,256
<i>Marla.</i>

197
00:14:25,334 --> 00:14:29,794
<i>The scratch on the roof of your mouth
that would heal if you could stop tonguing it.</i>

198
00:14:29,905 --> 00:14:31,998
<i>But you can't.</i>

199
00:14:32,908 --> 00:14:35,741
<i>..deeper into your cave as you walk.</i>

200
00:14:35,844 --> 00:14:39,406
<i>You feel a healing energy all around you.</i>

201
00:14:42,052 --> 00:14:44,110
<i>Now find your power animal.</i>

202
00:14:47,023 --> 00:14:49,048
Slide.

203
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:55,965
OK. Let's partner up.

204
00:14:56,066 --> 00:14:58,364
Pick someone special to you tonight.

205
00:15:04,575 --> 00:15:06,667
Hey.

206
00:15:07,078 --> 00:15:09,137
- We need to talk.
- Sure.

207
00:15:13,951 --> 00:15:16,044
- I'm onto you.
- What?

208
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,248
Yeah. You're a faker. You're not dying.

209
00:15:19,323 --> 00:15:21,120
Sorry?

210
00:15:21,192 --> 00:15:26,187
In the Tibetan-philosophy, Sylvia-Plath
sense of the word, I know we're all dying.

211
00:15:26,298 --> 00:15:30,496
- But you're not dying the way Chloe is.
- So?

212
00:15:31,103 --> 00:15:33,162
So you're a tourist.

213
00:15:33,271 --> 00:15:37,470
I've seen you. I saw you at melanoma,
I saw you at tuberculosis.

214
00:15:37,543 --> 00:15:40,067
I saw you at testicular cancer!

215
00:15:40,145 --> 00:15:41,772
I saw you practising this.

216
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,315
- Practising what?
- Telling me off.

217
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:48,217
Is it going as well as you hoped,... Rupert?

218
00:15:48,321 --> 00:15:50,117
I'll expose you.

219
00:15:50,188 --> 00:15:52,282
Go ahead. I'll expose you.

220
00:15:53,025 --> 00:15:55,892
Come together. Let yourselves cry.

221
00:16:02,902 --> 00:16:04,995
Oh, God. Why are you doing this?

222
00:16:05,104 --> 00:16:07,835
It's cheaper than a movie
and there's free coffee.

223
00:16:07,941 --> 00:16:10,704
Look, this is important.
These are my groups.

224
00:16:10,777 --> 00:16:12,904
I've been coming for over a year.

225
00:16:13,012 --> 00:16:16,210
- Why do you do it?
- I don't know.

226
00:16:16,316 --> 00:16:20,150
When people think you're dying,
they listen to you instead of...

227
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,212
Instead of waiting for their turn to speak.

228
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,584
Yeah. Yeah.

229
00:16:27,761 --> 00:16:30,629
Share yourself... completely.

230
00:16:31,432 --> 00:16:33,524
Look, you don't want to get into this.

231
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,660
- It becomes an addiction.
- Really?

232
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:40,036
I'm not kidding. I can't cry
if another faker is present, and I need this.

233
00:16:40,141 --> 00:16:42,200
You gotta find somewhere else to go.

234
00:16:42,277 --> 00:16:45,838
Candystripe a cancer ward.
It's not my problem.

235
00:16:49,017 --> 00:16:51,077
No, wait a second. Hold on.

236
00:16:51,187 --> 00:16:53,246
We'll split up the week, OK?

237
00:16:53,355 --> 00:16:55,549
You take lymphoma and tuberculosis.

238
00:16:55,623 --> 00:16:58,752
You take tuberculosis.
My smoking doesn't go over at all.

239
00:16:58,828 --> 00:17:02,161
OK. Good. Fine.
Testicular cancer should be no contest.

240
00:17:02,231 --> 00:17:06,167
Technically, I have more right to be there.
You still have your balls.

241
00:17:06,235 --> 00:17:08,601
- You're kidding.
- I dunno. Am I?

242
00:17:09,271 --> 00:17:10,704
No. No.

243
00:17:10,806 --> 00:17:13,435
- What do you want?
- I'll take the parasites.

244
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:16,308
You can't have both.
Take the blood parasites.

245
00:17:16,413 --> 00:17:20,713
- I want brain parasites.
- I'll take the blood but I want brain dementia.

246
00:17:20,817 --> 00:17:23,581
- I want that.
- You can't have the whole brain.

247
00:17:23,653 --> 00:17:26,178
So far, you have four. I only have two.

248
00:17:26,256 --> 00:17:30,192
OK. Take both the parasites. They're yours.

249
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:32,524
Now we both have three...

250
00:17:35,266 --> 00:17:37,894
Hey! You left half your clothes.

251
00:17:54,452 --> 00:17:56,614
- What, are you selling those?
- Yes!

252
00:17:56,688 --> 00:17:58,747
I'm selling some clothes!

253
00:17:58,857 --> 00:18:00,915
So! We each have three. That's six.

254
00:18:01,025 --> 00:18:03,859
What about the seventh day?
I want bowel cancer.

255
00:18:03,929 --> 00:18:06,022
<i>The girl had done her homework.</i>

256
00:18:06,131 --> 00:18:08,224
No. No. I want bowel cancer.

257
00:18:08,867 --> 00:18:10,927
That's your favorite too?

258
00:18:11,037 --> 00:18:14,528
- Tried to slip it by me, eh?
- Look, we'll split it.

259
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,699
Take the first and third Sunday.

260
00:18:19,178 --> 00:18:21,043
Deal.

261
00:18:23,649 --> 00:18:25,948
Looks like this is goodbye.

262
00:18:26,052 --> 00:18:28,179
Let's not make a big thing out of it.

263
00:18:28,288 --> 00:18:30,722
How's this for not making a big thing?

264
00:18:34,193 --> 00:18:35,990
Hey, Marla!

265
00:18:36,329 --> 00:18:38,490
Marla!

266
00:18:38,564 --> 00:18:41,159
Maybe we should exchange numbers.

267
00:18:41,268 --> 00:18:43,168
Should we?

268
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:47,330
- We might wanna switch nights.
- OK.

269
00:18:52,513 --> 00:18:55,005
<i>This is how I met Marla Singer.</i>

270
00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:00,982
<i>Marla's philosophy of life
was that she might die at any moment.</i>

271
00:19:01,088 --> 00:19:03,387
<i>The tragedy, she said, was that she didn't.</i>

272
00:19:03,491 --> 00:19:07,517
It doesn't have your name!
Who are you? Cornelius? Rupert?

273
00:19:07,594 --> 00:19:11,554
Travis? Any of the stupid names
you give each night?

274
00:19:14,536 --> 00:19:16,595
<i>You wake up at SeaTac.</i>

275
00:19:16,705 --> 00:19:19,640
<i>SFO. LAX.</i>

276
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:22,107
<i>You wake up at O'Hare.</i>

277
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:24,338
<i>Dallas Fort Worth.</i>

278
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,381
<i>BWI.</i>

279
00:19:26,449 --> 00:19:30,248
<i>Pacific. Mountain. Central.
Lose an hour. Gain an hour.</i>

280
00:19:30,352 --> 00:19:34,221
The check-in for that flight
isn't for another two hours, sir.

281
00:19:34,323 --> 00:19:37,588
<i>This is your life,
and it's ending one minute at a time.</i>

282
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:40,652
<i>You wake up at Air Harbor International.</i>

283
00:19:42,064 --> 00:19:45,932
<i>If you wake up at a different time,
in a different place,</i>

284
00:19:46,002 --> 00:19:48,665
<i>could you wake up as a different person?</i>

285
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:50,830
<i>Everywhere I travel,</i>

286
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,204
<i>tiny life.</i>

287
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,801
<i>Single-serving sugar and cream.</i>

288
00:19:55,879 --> 00:19:57,676
<i>Single pat of butter.</i>

289
00:19:57,781 --> 00:20:00,614
<i>The microwave cordon bleu hobby kit.</i>

290
00:20:00,684 --> 00:20:02,652
<i>Shampoo-conditioner combos.</i>

291
00:20:02,753 --> 00:20:06,621
<i>Sample-package mouthwash.
Tiny bars of soap.</i>

292
00:20:08,058 --> 00:20:10,584
<i>The people I meet on each flight,</i>

293
00:20:10,661 --> 00:20:12,787
<i>they're single-serving friends.</i>

294
00:20:12,863 --> 00:20:16,595
<i>Between takeoff and landing,
we have our time together.</i>

295
00:20:16,667 --> 00:20:18,897
<i>That's all we get.</i>

296
00:20:19,003 --> 00:20:20,903
<i>Welcome!</i>

297
00:20:23,007 --> 00:20:27,205
<i>On a long enough time line,
the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.</i>

298
00:20:27,278 --> 00:20:31,010
<i>I was a recall coordinator.
My job was to apply the formula.</i>

299
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:33,483
The infant went through the windshield.

300
00:20:33,585 --> 00:20:37,646
<i>A new car built by my company
leaves somewhere traveling at 60mph.</i>

301
00:20:37,723 --> 00:20:39,816
<i>The rear differential locks up.</i>

302
00:20:40,859 --> 00:20:43,453
The teenager's braces
are stuck to the ashtray.

303
00:20:43,529 --> 00:20:45,895
Might make a good anti-smoking ad.

304
00:20:45,998 --> 00:20:49,490
<i>The car crashes and burns
with everyone trapped inside.</i>

305
00:20:49,601 --> 00:20:51,865
<i>Now, should we initiate a recall?</i>

306
00:20:51,937 --> 00:20:54,031
The father must have been huge.

307
00:20:54,107 --> 00:20:57,337
See where the fat burned to the seat?
The polyester shirt?

308
00:20:57,443 --> 00:20:59,434
Very modern art.

309
00:20:59,511 --> 00:21:02,003
<i>Take the number of vehicles in the field, A.</i>

310
00:21:02,082 --> 00:21:04,812
<i>Multiply it by the probable rate of failure, B.</i>

311
00:21:04,884 --> 00:21:08,684
<i>Multiply the result by
the average out-of-court settlement, C.</i>

312
00:21:08,755 --> 00:21:10,848
<i>A x B x C</i>

313
00:21:11,057 --> 00:21:12,957
equals X.

314
00:21:13,059 --> 00:21:15,654
If X is less than the cost of a recall,

315
00:21:15,729 --> 00:21:17,754
we don't do one.

316
00:21:17,864 --> 00:21:21,061
Are there a lot of these kinds of accidents?

317
00:21:21,134 --> 00:21:23,069
You wouldn't believe.

318
00:21:24,538 --> 00:21:27,063
Which car company do you work for?

319
00:21:27,141 --> 00:21:29,268
A major one.

320
00:21:31,745 --> 00:21:35,681
<i>Every time the plane banked too sharply
on takeoff or landing,</i>

321
00:21:35,749 --> 00:21:39,049
<i>I prayed for a crash or a midair collision.</i>

322
00:21:39,721 --> 00:21:41,278
<i>Anything.</i>

323
00:21:50,132 --> 00:21:53,863
<i>Life insurance pays off triple
if you die on a business trip.</i>

324
00:21:56,805 --> 00:22:00,105
"If you are seated in an emergency exit row

325
00:22:00,176 --> 00:22:03,702
and would be unable or unwilling
to perform the duties

326
00:22:03,778 --> 00:22:08,216
listed on the safety card, please
ask a flight attendant to reseat you."

327
00:22:10,019 --> 00:22:12,078
It's a lot of responsibility.

328
00:22:12,155 --> 00:22:14,385
Wanna switch seats?

329
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:17,926
No. I'm not sure
I'm the man for that particularjob.

330
00:22:17,994 --> 00:22:22,398
An exit-door procedure at 30,000ft.

331
00:22:22,499 --> 00:22:24,557
The illusion of safety.

332
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,893
Yeah. I guess so.

333
00:22:26,969 --> 00:22:29,905
You know why
they put oxygen masks on planes?

334
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:34,535
- So you can breathe.
- Oxygen gets you high.

335
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:39,173
In a catastrophic emergency,
you take giant panic breaths.

336
00:22:39,249 --> 00:22:41,774
Suddenly you become euphoric, docile.

337
00:22:41,852 --> 00:22:44,151
You accept your fate.

338
00:22:44,789 --> 00:22:46,813
It's all right here.

339
00:22:46,924 --> 00:22:50,053
Emergency water landing, 600mph.

340
00:22:50,161 --> 00:22:52,994
Blank faces. Calm as Hindu cows.

341
00:22:53,064 --> 00:22:55,157
That's...

342
00:22:56,401 --> 00:22:58,665
That's an interesting theory.

343
00:23:00,672 --> 00:23:02,799
- What do you do?
- What do you mean?

344
00:23:02,874 --> 00:23:04,968
What do you do for a living?

345
00:23:05,044 --> 00:23:08,206
Why? So you can pretend you're interested?

346
00:23:10,882 --> 00:23:12,373
OK.

347
00:23:12,451 --> 00:23:15,352
You have
a kind of sick desperation in your laugh.

348
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:20,650
We have the exact same briefcase.

349
00:23:21,493 --> 00:23:23,484
Soap.

350
00:23:23,596 --> 00:23:27,260
- Sorry?
- I make and I sell soap.

351
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,765
The yardstick of civilization.

352
00:23:30,269 --> 00:23:32,237
<i>And this is how I met...</i>

353
00:23:32,371 --> 00:23:34,169
Tyler Durden.

354
00:23:34,241 --> 00:23:39,508
Did you know if you mix gasoline and
frozen orange juice, you can make napalm?

355
00:23:39,613 --> 00:23:42,582
- No, I did not. Is that true?
- That's right.

356
00:23:42,649 --> 00:23:46,483
One can make all kinds of explosives
with simple household items.

357
00:23:46,586 --> 00:23:49,021
- Really?
- If one was so inclined.

358
00:23:53,994 --> 00:23:59,058
Tyler, you are by far the most interesting
single-serving friend I have ever met.

359
00:24:00,935 --> 00:24:05,065
- Everything on a plane is single-serving...
- Oh, I get it. Very clever.

360
00:24:05,139 --> 00:24:06,697
Thank you.

361
00:24:06,807 --> 00:24:08,900
How's it working out for you?

362
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:11,741
- What?
- Being clever?

363
00:24:11,847 --> 00:24:14,212
Great.

364
00:24:14,282 --> 00:24:17,274
Keep it up, then. Right up.

365
00:24:18,487 --> 00:24:20,648
A question of etiquette.

366
00:24:20,722 --> 00:24:23,714
As I pass, do I give you the ass or the crotch?

367
00:24:30,766 --> 00:24:33,099
<i>How I came to live with Tyler is...</i>

368
00:24:33,169 --> 00:24:37,468
<i>Airlines have this policy
about vibrating luggage.</i>

369
00:24:45,148 --> 00:24:49,778
- Was it ticking?
- Throwers know modern bombs don't tick.

370
00:24:49,886 --> 00:24:53,049
- Sorry, throwers?
- Baggage handlers.

371
00:24:53,122 --> 00:24:55,353
But when a suitcase vibrates,

372
00:24:55,492 --> 00:24:58,153
the throwers have got to call the police.

373
00:24:58,261 --> 00:25:01,753
- My suitcase was vibrating?
- Nine times out of ten

374
00:25:01,864 --> 00:25:03,924
it's an electric razor.

375
00:25:04,001 --> 00:25:06,128
But... every once in a while

376
00:25:09,072 --> 00:25:11,132
it's a dildo.

377
00:25:11,909 --> 00:25:15,970
It's company policy never to imply
ownership in the event of a dildo.

378
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,948
<i>We have to use the indefinite article,
a dildo, never</i>

379
00:25:20,017 --> 00:25:22,110
<i>your dildo.</i>

380
00:25:22,186 --> 00:25:24,280
I don't own...

381
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:30,086
<i>I had everything in that suitcase.
My CK shirts.</i>

382
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:33,324
<i>My DKNYshoes. My AX ties.</i>

383
00:25:34,999 --> 00:25:37,331
<i>Never mind.</i>

384
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:41,934
Hey! That's my car!

385
00:25:48,247 --> 00:25:50,215
<i>Home was a condo on the 15th floor</i>

386
00:25:50,316 --> 00:25:53,341
<i>of a filing cabinet
for widows and professionals.</i>

387
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:56,047
<i>The walls were solid concrete.</i>

388
00:25:56,155 --> 00:25:58,214
<i>A foot of concrete is important</i>

389
00:25:58,324 --> 00:26:02,591
<i>when your next-door neighbor
has to watch game shows at full volume.</i>

390
00:26:02,662 --> 00:26:06,563
<i>Or when a blast of debris
that used to be your personal effects</i>

391
00:26:06,632 --> 00:26:10,660
<i>blows out of your windows
and sails flaming into the night.</i>

392
00:26:17,144 --> 00:26:19,408
<i>I suppose these things happen.</i>

393
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,353
There's... nothing up there.

394
00:26:34,429 --> 00:26:37,830
You can't go into the unit. Police orders.

395
00:26:46,508 --> 00:26:49,032
Do you have somebody you can call?

396
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:51,237
<i>How embarrassing.</i>

397
00:26:51,312 --> 00:26:54,214
<i>A houseful of condiments and no food.</i>

398
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:07,426
<i>The police later told me
the pilot light might have gone out</i>

399
00:27:08,431 --> 00:27:11,399
<i>letting out just a little bit of gas.</i>

400
00:27:11,467 --> 00:27:13,731
<i>That gas could have filled the condo.</i>

401
00:27:13,836 --> 00:27:17,329
<i>1700 square feet with high ceilings
for days and days.</i>

402
00:27:25,548 --> 00:27:29,315
<i>Then the refrigerator's compressor
could have clicked on.</i>

403
00:27:30,421 --> 00:27:32,479
<i>Yeah?</i>

404
00:27:35,625 --> 00:27:37,685
<i>I can hear you breathing...</i>

405
00:27:46,337 --> 00:27:50,273
<i>If you ask me now,
I couldn't tell you why I called him.</i>

406
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:35,750
<i>- Hello?
- Who's this?</i>

407
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:40,083
<i>- Tyler?
- Who is this?</i>

408
00:28:41,627 --> 00:28:43,823
We met... We met on the airplane.

409
00:28:43,931 --> 00:28:46,161
We had the same suitcase?

410
00:28:46,233 --> 00:28:48,325
The clever guy?

411
00:28:48,401 --> 00:28:50,768
<i>Oh, yeah. Right.</i>

412
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:55,401
I called a second ago. There was no answer.

413
00:28:55,509 --> 00:28:59,707
<i>- I'm at a payphone.
- Yeah, I *69'd you. I never pick up my phone.</i>

414
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:04,543
<i>So what's up?</i>

415
00:29:05,219 --> 00:29:07,244
Well.

416
00:29:07,355 --> 00:29:09,414
You're not gonna believe this.

417
00:29:11,558 --> 00:29:13,789
You know, it could be worse.

418
00:29:13,861 --> 00:29:17,627
A woman could cut off your penis
while you sleep and toss it out of a car.

419
00:29:18,466 --> 00:29:21,765
There's always that. I don't know.

420
00:29:21,836 --> 00:29:24,964
When you buy furniture,
you tell yourself, that's it.

421
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,133
That's the last sofa I'll need.

422
00:29:27,209 --> 00:29:30,007
Whatever happens,
that sofa problem is handled.

423
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:33,536
I had it all.
I had a stereo that was very decent.

424
00:29:33,648 --> 00:29:37,176
A wardrobe that was getting very respectable.

425
00:29:37,252 --> 00:29:39,413
I was close to being complete.

426
00:29:39,488 --> 00:29:42,049
- Shit, man. Now it's all gone.
- All gone.

427
00:29:42,158 --> 00:29:44,887
All gone.

428
00:29:46,161 --> 00:29:48,186
Do you know what a duvet is?

429
00:29:48,263 --> 00:29:51,165
- A comforter.
- It's a blanket.

430
00:29:51,234 --> 00:29:55,226
Just a blanket. Why do guys
like you and I know what a duvet is?

431
00:29:55,304 --> 00:29:59,469
Is this essential to our survival
in the hunter-gatherer sense?

432
00:29:59,576 --> 00:30:01,203
No.

433
00:30:01,277 --> 00:30:03,268
What are we, then?

434
00:30:03,381 --> 00:30:05,974
I dunno. Consumers.

435
00:30:06,049 --> 00:30:08,108
Right. We're consumers.

436
00:30:08,218 --> 00:30:11,484
We are by-products of a lifestyle obsession.

437
00:30:11,589 --> 00:30:15,490
Murder, crime, poverty.
These things don't concern me.

438
00:30:15,592 --> 00:30:19,029
What concerns me are celebrity magazines,

439
00:30:19,096 --> 00:30:21,189
television with 500 channels,

440
00:30:21,265 --> 00:30:23,927
some guy's name on my underwear. Rogaine.

441
00:30:24,035 --> 00:30:26,095
Viagra. Olestra.

442
00:30:26,204 --> 00:30:29,036
- Martha Stewart.
- Fuck Martha Stewart.

443
00:30:29,106 --> 00:30:32,598
She's polishing the brass on the Titanic.
It's all going down.

444
00:30:32,711 --> 00:30:36,442
So fuck off with your sofa units
and Strinne green stripe patterns.

445
00:30:36,515 --> 00:30:39,847
I say never be complete.

446
00:30:39,917 --> 00:30:41,943
I say stop being perfect.

447
00:30:42,054 --> 00:30:44,079
I say let's evolve.

448
00:30:44,156 --> 00:30:46,454
Let the chips fall where they may.

449
00:30:48,627 --> 00:30:50,720
But that's me, and I could be wrong.

450
00:30:50,829 --> 00:30:52,888
Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.

451
00:30:52,964 --> 00:30:55,456
It's just stuff. Not a tragedy...

452
00:30:55,535 --> 00:30:59,301
You did lose a lot of versatile solutions
for modern living.

453
00:30:59,371 --> 00:31:01,965
Fuck, you're right. I don't smoke.

454
00:31:05,344 --> 00:31:09,110
My insurance is probably gonna cover it, so...

455
00:31:11,551 --> 00:31:13,678
What?

456
00:31:13,786 --> 00:31:16,915
The things you own end up owning you.

457
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:22,318
Do what you like, man.

458
00:31:23,062 --> 00:31:25,497
Oh, it's late.

459
00:31:25,566 --> 00:31:28,296
- Hey, thanks for the beer.
- Yeah, man.

460
00:31:28,368 --> 00:31:30,461
I should find a hotel.

461
00:31:31,205 --> 00:31:33,298
What?

462
00:31:33,373 --> 00:31:35,000
What?

463
00:31:35,109 --> 00:31:37,168
- A hotel?
- Yeah.

464
00:31:37,277 --> 00:31:40,338
- Just ask, man.
- What are you talking about?

465
00:31:40,415 --> 00:31:44,180
Oh, God. Three pitchers of beer
and you still can't ask.

466
00:31:45,185 --> 00:31:46,813
What?

467
00:31:46,921 --> 00:31:49,549
You called me
because you needed a place to stay.

468
00:31:49,624 --> 00:31:53,082
- Oh, hey. No, no, no.
- Yes, you did. So just ask.

469
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:55,721
Cut the foreplay and just ask, man.

470
00:31:57,532 --> 00:31:59,796
Would... Would that be a problem?

471
00:31:59,901 --> 00:32:01,961
Is it a problem for you to ask?

472
00:32:02,972 --> 00:32:05,201
- Can I stay at your place?
- Yeah.

473
00:32:06,574 --> 00:32:08,634
Thanks.

474
00:32:12,815 --> 00:32:15,808
- I want you to do me a favor.
- Yeah, sure.

475
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:18,318
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.

476
00:32:18,387 --> 00:32:20,355
What?

477
00:32:20,422 --> 00:32:24,257
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.

478
00:32:24,361 --> 00:32:27,261
<i>Let me tell you a little bit about Tyler Durden.</i>

479
00:32:27,463 --> 00:32:29,829
<i>Tyler was a night person.</i>

480
00:32:29,932 --> 00:32:32,163
While the rest of us slept, he worked.

481
00:32:32,235 --> 00:32:35,398
He had one part-time job as a projectionist.

482
00:32:35,472 --> 00:32:38,464
A movie doesn't come all on one big reel.
It comes on a few.

483
00:32:38,575 --> 00:32:42,272
Someone has to switch the projectors
at the exact moment

484
00:32:42,379 --> 00:32:45,611
that one reel ends and the next one begins.

485
00:32:45,683 --> 00:32:49,618
You can see little dots come into
the upper right corner of the screen.

486
00:32:49,686 --> 00:32:52,417
In the industry, we call them cigarette burns.

487
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:54,583
That's the cue for a changeover.

488
00:32:54,659 --> 00:32:59,426
He flips the projectors, movie keeps
going and the audience has no idea.

489
00:32:59,497 --> 00:33:01,761
Why would anyone want this shitjob?

490
00:33:01,866 --> 00:33:05,029
Because it affords him
interesting opportunities.

491
00:33:05,102 --> 00:33:08,630
Like splicing a frame of pornography
into family films.

492
00:33:08,707 --> 00:33:13,700
So when the snooty cat and the courageous
dog with the celebrity voices first meet,

493
00:33:13,845 --> 00:33:18,044
that's when you'll catch a flash
of Tyler's contribution to the film.

494
00:33:24,923 --> 00:33:27,517
Nobody knows that they saw it but they did.

495
00:33:27,626 --> 00:33:30,187
Nice, big cock.

496
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,731
Even a hummingbird
couldn't catch Tyler at work.

497
00:33:43,076 --> 00:33:48,104
Tyler also works sometimes as a banquet
waiter at the luxurious Pressman hotel.

498
00:33:52,753 --> 00:33:56,813
<i>He was the guerrilla terrorist
of the food service industry.</i>

499
00:33:56,923 --> 00:33:59,222
Do not watch. I cannot go when you watch.

500
00:33:59,293 --> 00:34:03,696
Apart from seasoning the lobster bisque,
he farted on meringues,

501
00:34:03,764 --> 00:34:06,324
and as for the cream of mushroom soup...

502
00:34:06,433 --> 00:34:08,458
Go ahead, tell 'em.

503
00:34:08,535 --> 00:34:10,526
You get the idea.

504
00:34:10,738 --> 00:34:13,970
- You just want me to hit you?
- Come on. Do me this one favor.

505
00:34:14,075 --> 00:34:17,441
- Why?
- I don't know. Never been in a fight. You?

506
00:34:17,511 --> 00:34:21,505
- No. But that's a good thing.
- You can't know yourself if you haven't!

507
00:34:21,583 --> 00:34:23,949
I don't wanna die without any scars.

508
00:34:24,052 --> 00:34:28,318
- Come on. Hit me, before I lose my nerve.
- Oh, God. This is crazy.

509
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:30,688
So go crazy! Let it rip.

510
00:34:30,759 --> 00:34:33,455
- I don't know about this.
- I don't either.

511
00:34:33,528 --> 00:34:36,589
Who gives a shit? No-one's watching.
What do you care?

512
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:39,166
This is crazy. You want me to hit you?!

513
00:34:39,267 --> 00:34:41,326
That's right.

514
00:34:41,403 --> 00:34:44,601
- Where? Like, in the face?
- Surprise me.

515
00:34:46,776 --> 00:34:48,869
This is so fucking stupid.

516
00:34:59,756 --> 00:35:01,950
Motherfucker!

517
00:35:02,024 --> 00:35:04,117
He hit me in the ear!

518
00:35:04,193 --> 00:35:07,391
- Well, Jesus, I'm sorry.
- Ow, Christ!

519
00:35:07,497 --> 00:35:09,556
- Why the ear, man?
- I fucked it up.

520
00:35:09,633 --> 00:35:11,362
No, that was perfect.

521
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:26,374
No, it's all right.

522
00:35:27,218 --> 00:35:29,311
It really hurts.

523
00:35:29,754 --> 00:35:31,813
Right.

524
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:34,385
Hit me again.

525
00:35:34,459 --> 00:35:36,586
No, you hit me. Come on!

526
00:35:53,545 --> 00:35:56,036
We should do this again sometime.

527
00:36:08,827 --> 00:36:11,058
- Where's your car?
- What car?

528
00:36:21,574 --> 00:36:23,906
<i>I don't know how Tyler found that house</i>

529
00:36:24,044 --> 00:36:26,275
<i>but he said he'd been there for a year.</i>

530
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:29,246
<i>It looked like it was waiting to be torn down.</i>

531
00:36:29,315 --> 00:36:31,715
<i>Most of the windows were boarded up.</i>

532
00:36:31,818 --> 00:36:37,189
<i>There was no lock on the front door from
when the police, or whoever, kicked it in.</i>

533
00:36:37,258 --> 00:36:39,317
<i>The stairs were ready to collapse.</i>

534
00:36:39,427 --> 00:36:41,918
<i>I didn't know if he owned it or was squatting.</i>

535
00:36:42,063 --> 00:36:44,531
<i>Neither would have surprised me.</i>

536
00:36:45,433 --> 00:36:47,493
Yep. That's you.

537
00:36:47,602 --> 00:36:50,196
That's me. That's the toilet. Good?

538
00:36:50,272 --> 00:36:52,330
Yeah, thanks.

539
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,340
<i>What a shithole.</i>

540
00:36:54,442 --> 00:36:56,411
<i>Nothing worked.</i>

541
00:37:00,048 --> 00:37:03,950
<i>Turning on one light meant
another light in the house went out.</i>

542
00:37:04,086 --> 00:37:07,817
<i>There were no neighbors.
Just warehouses and a paper mill.</i>

543
00:37:07,889 --> 00:37:11,883
<i>That fart smell of steam.
The hamster-cage smell of wood chips.</i>

544
00:37:13,662 --> 00:37:16,062
What have we here?

545
00:37:30,847 --> 00:37:32,941
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

546
00:37:43,927 --> 00:37:46,987
<i>Every time it rained, we had to kill the power.</i>

547
00:37:47,898 --> 00:37:51,299
<i>By the end of the first month,
I didn't miss TV.</i>

548
00:37:52,336 --> 00:37:55,670
<i>I didn't even mind the warm, stale refrigerator.</i>

549
00:38:08,018 --> 00:38:10,146
Can I be next?

550
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:16,619
All right, man.

551
00:38:16,729 --> 00:38:18,719
Lose the tie.

552
00:38:22,734 --> 00:38:27,138
<i>At night, Tyler and I were alone
for half a mile in every direction.</i>

553
00:38:32,578 --> 00:38:36,514
<i>Rain trickled down through
the plaster and the light fixtures.</i>

554
00:38:36,582 --> 00:38:39,416
<i>Everything wooden swelled and shrank.</i>

555
00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:42,715
<i>Everywhere were rusted nails
to snag your elbow on.</i>

556
00:38:42,788 --> 00:38:45,383
<i>The previous occupant had been a shut-in.</i>

557
00:38:45,458 --> 00:38:47,551
Hey, man. What are you reading?

558
00:38:47,627 --> 00:38:51,995
Listen to this. It's an article written
by an organ in the first person.

559
00:38:52,064 --> 00:38:54,829
"I am Jack's medulla oblongata.
Without me,

560
00:38:54,935 --> 00:38:58,393
Jack could not regulate
his heart rate or breathing."

561
00:38:58,471 --> 00:39:00,565
There's a whole series of these.

562
00:39:00,641 --> 00:39:02,733
"I Am Jill's Nipples."

563
00:39:04,744 --> 00:39:08,738
- "I Am Jack's Colon."
- "I Get Cancer. I Kill Jack."

564
00:39:11,986 --> 00:39:15,786
<i>After fighting, everything else
in life got the volume turned down.</i>

565
00:39:17,792 --> 00:39:19,487
What?

566
00:39:19,594 --> 00:39:23,156
<i>- You could deal with anything.
- Have you finished those reports?</i>

567
00:39:27,802 --> 00:39:30,397
<i>If you could choose,
who would you fight?</i>

568
00:39:30,472 --> 00:39:32,565
I'd fight my boss, probably.

569
00:39:32,641 --> 00:39:34,768
Really?

570
00:39:34,843 --> 00:39:38,210
- Yeah, why? Who would you fight?
- I'd fight my dad.

571
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,373
I don't know my dad.

572
00:39:40,449 --> 00:39:42,383
I mean, I know him, but...

573
00:39:42,451 --> 00:39:44,818
He left when I was like, six years old.

574
00:39:44,887 --> 00:39:47,878
Married this other woman
and had some other kids.

575
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:50,049
He did this every six years.

576
00:39:50,192 --> 00:39:54,289
- He changes city and starts a new family.
- Fucker's setting up franchises!

577
00:39:55,098 --> 00:39:57,224
My dad never went to college.

578
00:39:57,299 --> 00:40:01,236
- So it was real important that I go.
- That sounds familiar.

579
00:40:01,304 --> 00:40:05,742
So I graduate. Call him up long-distance
and say, "Dad, now what?"

580
00:40:05,843 --> 00:40:07,834
- He says, "Get ajob."
- Same here.

581
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:10,606
Now I'm 25. Make my yearly call again.

582
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,671
"Dad, now what?"

583
00:40:12,749 --> 00:40:14,877
He says, "I dunno. Get married."

584
00:40:14,952 --> 00:40:18,444
You can't get married.

585
00:40:19,222 --> 00:40:21,282
I'm a 30-year-old boy.

586
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:23,849
We're a generation of men raised by women.

587
00:40:23,927 --> 00:40:28,228
I'm wondering if another woman
is really the answer we need.

588
00:40:34,238 --> 00:40:37,436
<i>Most of the week, we were Ozzie and Harriet.</i>

589
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:41,745
<i>But every Saturday night,
we were finding something out.</i>

590
00:40:42,947 --> 00:40:46,439
<i>We were finding out more and more
that we were not alone.</i>

591
00:40:50,356 --> 00:40:54,985
<i>It used to be that when I came home angry
or depressed, I'd just clean my condo.</i>

592
00:40:55,093 --> 00:40:57,153
<i>Polish my Scandinavian furniture.</i>

593
00:40:57,296 --> 00:41:02,324
<i>I should have been looking for a new condo
or haggling with my insurance company.</i>

594
00:41:02,401 --> 00:41:06,167
<i>I should have been upset
about my nice flaming little shit.</i>

595
00:41:06,305 --> 00:41:08,170
<i>But I wasn't.</i>

596
00:41:08,307 --> 00:41:11,937
The premise of cybernetting an office
is make things more efficient.

597
00:41:12,012 --> 00:41:14,878
<i>Monday mornings,
I just thought about next week.</i>

598
00:41:14,947 --> 00:41:17,973
Can I get the icon in cornflower blue?

599
00:41:18,084 --> 00:41:19,177
Absolutely.

600
00:41:19,319 --> 00:41:22,550
Efficiency is priority No.1, people.

601
00:41:22,689 --> 00:41:25,486
Because waste is a thief.

602
00:41:25,558 --> 00:41:28,687
I showed this to my man here.
You liked it, didn't you?

603
00:41:32,366 --> 00:41:36,302
<i>You can swallow a pint of blood
before you get sick.</i>

604
00:41:37,337 --> 00:41:39,567
<i>It was right in everyone's face.</i>

605
00:41:39,639 --> 00:41:41,801
<i>Tyler and I just made it visible.</i>

606
00:41:41,909 --> 00:41:44,343
<i>It was on the tip of everyone's tongue.</i>

607
00:41:44,412 --> 00:41:46,505
<i>Tyler and I just gave it a name.</i>

608
00:41:57,725 --> 00:41:59,784
Come on, you've gotta go home!

609
00:42:22,017 --> 00:42:24,349
Turn off the jukebox. Lock the back.

610
00:42:45,241 --> 00:42:48,973
<i>Every week,
Tyler gave the rules that he and I decided.</i>

611
00:42:49,046 --> 00:42:51,105
Gentlemen!

612
00:42:51,882 --> 00:42:53,974
Welcome to Fight Club.

613
00:42:56,086 --> 00:42:58,247
The first rule of Fight Club is

614
00:42:58,389 --> 00:43:00,721
you do not talk about Fight Club.

615
00:43:00,825 --> 00:43:03,420
The second rule of Fight Club is

616
00:43:03,828 --> 00:43:07,264
you do not talk about Fight Club!

617
00:43:07,398 --> 00:43:09,663
Third rule of Fight Club.

618
00:43:09,734 --> 00:43:12,532
Someone yells stop, goes limp, taps out,

619
00:43:12,637 --> 00:43:15,400
the fight is over. Fourth rule.

620
00:43:15,473 --> 00:43:17,806
Only two guys to a fight.

621
00:43:17,876 --> 00:43:19,741
Fifth rule.

622
00:43:19,845 --> 00:43:22,507
One fight at a time, fellas.

623
00:43:22,614 --> 00:43:25,083
Sixth rule. No shirts. No shoes.

624
00:43:25,151 --> 00:43:29,086
Seventh rule.
Fights will go on as long as they have to.

625
00:43:30,922 --> 00:43:33,517
And the eighth and final rule.

626
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:37,856
If this is your first night at Fight Club

627
00:43:37,929 --> 00:43:40,023
you have to fight.

628
00:43:44,070 --> 00:43:46,130
<i>This kid from work, Ricky,</i>

629
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:50,733
<i>couldn't remember whether
you ordered pens with blue ink or black.</i>

630
00:43:50,843 --> 00:43:53,243
<i>But Ricky was a god for ten minutes</i>

631
00:43:53,312 --> 00:43:56,680
<i>when he trounced
the maitre d' of a local food court.</i>

632
00:43:58,551 --> 00:44:03,888
<i>Sometimes, all you could hear were the flat,
hard, packing sounds over the yelling.</i>

633
00:44:07,661 --> 00:44:10,687
<i>Or the wet choke
when someone gasped and sprayed...</i>

634
00:44:10,764 --> 00:44:12,789
Stop!

635
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,768
<i>You weren't alive anywhere
like you were there.</i>

636
00:44:15,870 --> 00:44:20,670
<i>But Fight Club only exists in the hours
between when Fight Club starts and ends.</i>

637
00:44:21,174 --> 00:44:24,201
<i>Even if I could tell someone
they had a good fight,</i>

638
00:44:24,312 --> 00:44:26,610
<i>I wouldn't be talking to the same man.</i>

639
00:44:26,714 --> 00:44:30,013
<i>Who you were in Fight Club
is not who you were outside of it.</i>

640
00:44:30,118 --> 00:44:35,146
<i>A guy came to Fight Club for the first time.
His ass was a wad of cookie dough.</i>

641
00:44:35,223 --> 00:44:38,091
<i>After a few weeks, he was carved out of wood.</i>

642
00:44:38,928 --> 00:44:42,125
If you could fight any celebrity,
who would you fight?

643
00:44:42,196 --> 00:44:45,325
- Alive or dead?
- Doesn't matter. Who'd be tough?

644
00:44:46,235 --> 00:44:49,363
Hemingway. You?

645
00:44:50,005 --> 00:44:53,168
Shatner. I'd fight William Shatner.

646
00:44:54,209 --> 00:44:57,440
<i>We all started seeing things differently.</i>

647
00:44:58,714 --> 00:45:02,048
<i>Everywhere we went,
we were sizing things up.</i>

648
00:45:05,387 --> 00:45:08,551
<i>I felt sorry for guys packed into gyms,</i>

649
00:45:08,625 --> 00:45:12,721
<i>trying to look like how Calvin Klein
or Tommy Hilfiger said they should.</i>

650
00:45:12,796 --> 00:45:14,924
Is that what a man looks like?

651
00:45:15,832 --> 00:45:18,665
Oh, self-improvement is masturbation.

652
00:45:18,768 --> 00:45:20,827
Now, self-destruction...

653
00:45:20,937 --> 00:45:22,929
Excuse me.

654
00:45:57,576 --> 00:46:00,773
<i>Fight Club wasn't about winning or losing.</i>

655
00:46:00,846 --> 00:46:02,905
<i>It wasn't about words.</i>

656
00:46:04,850 --> 00:46:08,309
<i>The hysterical shouting was in tongues</i>

657
00:46:08,421 --> 00:46:10,388
<i>like at a Pentecostal Church.</i>

658
00:46:14,927 --> 00:46:17,020
- Is that it?
- Stop!

659
00:46:17,096 --> 00:46:19,997
<i>When the fight was over, nothing was solved.</i>

660
00:46:20,066 --> 00:46:22,000
<i>But nothing mattered.</i>

661
00:46:22,068 --> 00:46:24,866
Cool.

662
00:46:24,937 --> 00:46:27,736
<i>Afterwards, we all felt saved.</i>

663
00:46:28,676 --> 00:46:30,940
Hey, man. How about next week?

664
00:46:31,045 --> 00:46:33,103
How about next month?!

665
00:46:33,212 --> 00:46:35,272
Irvine, you're in the middle.

666
00:46:35,349 --> 00:46:37,408
New guy, you too.

667
00:46:39,153 --> 00:46:41,314
<i>Sometimes, Tyler spoke for me.</i>

668
00:46:41,422 --> 00:46:43,515
He fell down some stairs.

669
00:46:44,158 --> 00:46:46,251
I fell down some stairs.

670
00:46:48,095 --> 00:46:52,760
<i>Fight Club became the reason to cut
your hair short or trim your fingernails.</i>

671
00:46:52,867 --> 00:46:55,334
OK. Any historical figure.

672
00:46:55,436 --> 00:46:57,302
I'd fight Gandhi.

673
00:46:57,939 --> 00:46:59,770
Good answer.

674
00:46:59,874 --> 00:47:02,104
- How about you?
- Lincoln.

675
00:47:02,177 --> 00:47:04,772
Lincoln?

676
00:47:04,879 --> 00:47:08,474
Big guy, big reach.
Skinny guys fight till they're burger.

677
00:47:09,350 --> 00:47:11,443
Fuck!

678
00:47:12,655 --> 00:47:15,317
Hey, even the Mona Lisa's falling apart.

679
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,799
Hello?

680
00:47:25,901 --> 00:47:28,301
<i>Where have you been the last eight weeks?</i>

681
00:47:28,370 --> 00:47:29,701
<i>Marla?</i>

682
00:47:32,675 --> 00:47:35,804
<i>- How did you find me?
- You left a forwarding number.</i>

683
00:47:35,912 --> 00:47:38,903
I haven't seen you at any support groups.

684
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:42,179
<i>We split 'em up.
That was the idea. Remember?</i>

685
00:47:42,285 --> 00:47:45,118
Yeah, but you haven't been going to yours.

686
00:47:45,188 --> 00:47:48,715
- How do you know?
- I cheated.

687
00:47:48,792 --> 00:47:50,623
I found a new one.

688
00:47:51,161 --> 00:47:53,425
- Really?
- It's for men only.

689
00:47:53,530 --> 00:47:55,122
Like the testicle thing?

690
00:47:58,903 --> 00:48:00,927
Look, this is a bad time.

691
00:48:01,004 --> 00:48:03,439
I've been going to Debtors Anonymous.

692
00:48:03,541 --> 00:48:07,102
<i>- They're really fucked-up people...
- I'm on my way out.</i>

693
00:48:07,178 --> 00:48:09,544
Me too. I've got a stomach full of Xanax.

694
00:48:09,647 --> 00:48:11,945
I took what was left of a bottle.

695
00:48:12,016 --> 00:48:14,109
It might have been too much.

696
00:48:14,185 --> 00:48:17,814
<i>Picture Marla Singer throw herself
around her crummy apartment.</i>

697
00:48:17,956 --> 00:48:22,415
This isn't a for-real suicide thing.
This is probably a cry-for-help thing.

698
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:25,429
So you're staying in tonight, then?

699
00:48:25,531 --> 00:48:28,364
Do you wanna wait
and hear me describe death?

700
00:48:28,433 --> 00:48:32,961
<i>Do you wanna listen
and see if my spirit can use a phone?</i>

701
00:48:35,207 --> 00:48:37,869
<i>Have you ever heard a death rattle before?</i>

702
00:49:04,171 --> 00:49:09,005
<i>Tyler's door was closed. I'd been here for
two months and his door was never closed.</i>

703
00:49:14,014 --> 00:49:17,074
You won't believe this dream
I had last night.

704
00:49:17,184 --> 00:49:20,449
I can hardly believe anything about last night.

705
00:49:30,264 --> 00:49:32,233
What are you doing here?

706
00:49:34,936 --> 00:49:37,029
What?

707
00:49:37,105 --> 00:49:39,539
This is my house.
What are you doing here?

708
00:49:41,943 --> 00:49:43,934
Fuck you!

709
00:49:58,561 --> 00:50:01,928
Oh, you've got some fucked-up friends!

710
00:50:02,031 --> 00:50:04,022
Limber, though.

711
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:06,091
Silly cooze.

712
00:50:07,169 --> 00:50:09,900
I come in last night. Phone's off the hook.

713
00:50:09,973 --> 00:50:12,065
Guess who's on the other end?

714
00:50:12,141 --> 00:50:14,336
<i>I knew the story before he told me.</i>

715
00:50:16,647 --> 00:50:20,242
<i>Have you ever heard a death rattle before?</i>

716
00:50:20,317 --> 00:50:23,150
Do you think it'll live up to its name?

717
00:50:23,253 --> 00:50:26,848
<i>Or will it just be a death hairball?</i>

718
00:50:30,261 --> 00:50:34,253
<i>Prepare to evacuate soul.</i>

719
00:50:34,331 --> 00:50:35,958
<i>Ten,</i>

720
00:50:36,066 --> 00:50:38,865
<i>nine,... eight...</i>

721
00:50:38,937 --> 00:50:41,167
<i>How could Tyler, of all people,</i>

722
00:50:41,272 --> 00:50:45,140
<i>think it was a bad thing
that Marla Singer was about to die?</i>

723
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:46,870
<i>Five,</i>

724
00:50:46,945 --> 00:50:48,537
<i>four...</i>

725
00:50:49,314 --> 00:50:51,373
Hang on.

726
00:50:56,821 --> 00:50:59,153
You got here fast.

727
00:51:00,693 --> 00:51:02,786
Did I call you?

728
00:51:13,505 --> 00:51:16,600
The mattress is all sealed in slippery plastic.

729
00:51:19,845 --> 00:51:22,246
Oh, don't worry. It's not a threat to you.

730
00:51:25,051 --> 00:51:26,951
Oh, fuck!

731
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:29,113
Somebody called the cops.

732
00:51:41,034 --> 00:51:44,527
- Hey, where's 513?
- End of the hall.

733
00:51:45,339 --> 00:51:49,207
The girl who lives there
used to be a charming, lovely girl.

734
00:51:49,276 --> 00:51:51,437
She has lost faith in herself.

735
00:51:51,545 --> 00:51:54,378
- Miss Singer, let us help you!
- She's a monster!

736
00:51:54,448 --> 00:51:58,579
- You have every reason to live.
- She's infectious human waste!

737
00:51:58,653 --> 00:52:02,452
- Miss Singer!
- Good luck trying to save her!

738
00:52:07,262 --> 00:52:09,457
If I fall asleep,

739
00:52:09,564 --> 00:52:11,828
I'm done for.

740
00:52:13,802 --> 00:52:15,997
You're gonna have to keep me up

741
00:52:16,071 --> 00:52:18,164
all night.

742
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:20,573
Un-fucking-believable.

743
00:52:20,643 --> 00:52:22,838
<i>He was obviously able to handle it.</i>

744
00:52:22,912 --> 00:52:26,608
- You know what I mean, you fucked her.
- No, I didn't.

745
00:52:26,681 --> 00:52:28,809
- Never?
- No.

746
00:52:29,719 --> 00:52:31,846
You're not into her, are you?

747
00:52:31,921 --> 00:52:34,013
No! God, not at all.

748
00:52:34,089 --> 00:52:36,684
<i>I am Jack's raging bile duct.</i>

749
00:52:36,826 --> 00:52:38,726
Are you sure? You can tell me.

750
00:52:38,861 --> 00:52:40,692
Believe me, I'm sure.

751
00:52:40,830 --> 00:52:44,096
<i>- Put a gun to my head and spray my brains.
- That's good.</i>

752
00:52:44,201 --> 00:52:46,930
She's a predator posing as a house pet.
Stay away.

753
00:52:48,905 --> 00:52:52,535
The shit that came out of
this woman's mouth, I had never heard!

754
00:52:52,643 --> 00:52:54,304
My God.

755
00:52:54,411 --> 00:52:57,744
I haven't been fucked like that
since grade school.

756
00:52:57,881 --> 00:53:00,315
<i>How could Tyler not go for that?</i>

757
00:53:00,417 --> 00:53:03,944
<i>The other night,
he was splicing sex organs into Cinderella.</i>

758
00:53:04,054 --> 00:53:06,853
Marla doesn't need a lover,
just a caseworker.

759
00:53:06,924 --> 00:53:09,518
Or a wash.
This isn't love, it's sport fucking.

760
00:53:09,626 --> 00:53:12,494
<i>She invaded my support groups
and now my home.</i>

761
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:14,657
Hey, hey. Sit down.

762
00:53:18,735 --> 00:53:22,172
Now, listen.
I can't have you talking to her about me.

763
00:53:22,273 --> 00:53:24,104
Why would I...

764
00:53:24,175 --> 00:53:29,545
Say anything about me or what goes on
in this house to her or anybody,... we're done.

765
00:53:29,647 --> 00:53:32,309
- Now promise me. You promise?
- OK.

766
00:53:32,383 --> 00:53:34,511
- Yeah, I promise.
- Promise?

767
00:53:34,587 --> 00:53:37,988
- I just said, I promise! What...
- That's three times you promised.

768
00:53:39,492 --> 00:53:43,485
<i>If only I had wasted a few minutes
and gone to watch Marla Singer die,</i>

769
00:53:43,562 --> 00:53:45,655
<i>none of this would have happened.</i>

770
00:53:50,570 --> 00:53:53,504
Harder, yes! Oh, harder, harder!

771
00:54:00,113 --> 00:54:02,580
<i>I could have moved to another room.</i>

772
00:54:03,717 --> 00:54:07,551
<i>On the third floor
where I might not have heard them.</i>

773
00:54:07,621 --> 00:54:09,714
<i>But I didn't.</i>

774
00:54:33,949 --> 00:54:38,044
- What are you doing?
- Just going to bed.

775
00:54:38,152 --> 00:54:40,212
Wanna finish her off?

776
00:54:43,125 --> 00:54:46,651
- No. No, thank you.
- I've found a cigarette.

777
00:54:46,761 --> 00:54:50,129
- Who were you talking to?
- Shut up.

778
00:54:50,199 --> 00:54:53,464
<i>I became the calm little center of the world.</i>

779
00:54:54,136 --> 00:54:56,196
<i>I was the Zen master.</i>

780
00:55:01,343 --> 00:55:03,335
<i>I wrote little haiku poems.</i>

781
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:06,278
<i>I e-mailed them to everyone.</i>

782
00:55:06,382 --> 00:55:08,474
Is that your blood?

783
00:55:10,186 --> 00:55:12,245
Some of it, yeah.

784
00:55:12,355 --> 00:55:15,017
You can't smoke in here.

785
00:55:15,091 --> 00:55:17,185
Take the rest of the day off.

786
00:55:17,261 --> 00:55:19,785
Come back Monday with some clean clothes.

787
00:55:19,862 --> 00:55:21,989
Get yourself together.

788
00:55:22,365 --> 00:55:24,698
<i>I got right in everyone's hostile face.</i>

789
00:55:24,802 --> 00:55:27,293
<i>"Yes, these are bruises from fighting."</i>

790
00:55:27,404 --> 00:55:29,463
<i>"Yes, I'm comfortable with that."</i>

791
00:55:29,572 --> 00:55:31,438
<i>"I am enlightened."</i>

792
00:55:33,377 --> 00:55:38,508
<i>You give up the condo life, give up
all your flaming worldly possessions,</i>

793
00:55:38,616 --> 00:55:41,676
<i>move to a dilapidated house
in a toxic waste area,</i>

794
00:55:41,785 --> 00:55:45,653
<i>and you have to come home to this.</i>

795
00:55:56,301 --> 00:55:59,702
<i>- Hello.
- This is Detective Stern with the Arson Unit.</i>

796
00:55:59,804 --> 00:56:04,036
<i>We have some new information about
the incident at your former condo.</i>

797
00:56:04,109 --> 00:56:05,406
Yes.

798
00:56:05,477 --> 00:56:10,415
I don't know if you're aware, but someone
sprayed Freon into your front-door lock.

799
00:56:10,483 --> 00:56:13,145
<i>They used a chisel to shatter the cylinder.</i>

800
00:56:13,252 --> 00:56:15,242
No, I wasn't aware of that.

801
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:17,312
<i>I am Jack's cold sweat.</i>

802
00:56:17,423 --> 00:56:19,687
Does this sound strange to you?

803
00:56:19,759 --> 00:56:22,626
<i>Yes, sir, strange. Very strange.</i>

804
00:56:22,695 --> 00:56:24,720
<i>- The dynamite
- Dynamite?</i>

805
00:56:24,830 --> 00:56:27,924
left a residue
of ammonium oxalate potassium perchloride.

806
00:56:28,067 --> 00:56:31,504
<i>- Do you know what this means?
- No, what does it mean?</i>

807
00:56:31,571 --> 00:56:33,505
It means it was home-made.

808
00:56:33,573 --> 00:56:37,839
I'm sorry. This is just coming
as quite a shock to me, sir.

809
00:56:37,911 --> 00:56:43,474
Whoever set this dynamite could have blown
out your pilot light days before the explosion.

810
00:56:43,550 --> 00:56:46,644
<i>- The gas was just a detonator.
- Who would go and do that?</i>

811
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,779
<i>- I'll ask the questions.
- Tell him.</i>

812
00:56:48,922 --> 00:56:53,326
Tell him the liberator who destroyed
my property realigned my perceptions.

813
00:56:53,394 --> 00:56:55,487
<i>Excuse me. Are you there?</i>

814
00:56:55,563 --> 00:56:58,497
I am listening.
It's hard to know what to make of this.

815
00:56:58,565 --> 00:57:03,060
Have you recently made enemies who might
have access to home-made dynamite?

816
00:57:03,137 --> 00:57:05,401
- Enemies?
- Reject civilization,

817
00:57:05,506 --> 00:57:07,566
especially material possessions.

818
00:57:07,676 --> 00:57:10,542
<i>- Son, this is serious.
- Yes, I know it's serious.</i>

819
00:57:10,611 --> 00:57:13,205
<i>- I mean that.
- Yes, it's very serious.</i>

820
00:57:13,314 --> 00:57:16,148
Look, nobody takes this
more seriously than me.

821
00:57:16,218 --> 00:57:18,948
That condo was my life. OK?

822
00:57:19,088 --> 00:57:22,580
I loved every stick of furniture in that place.

823
00:57:22,691 --> 00:57:25,717
<i>That was not just a bunch of stuff
that got destroyed.</i>

824
00:57:25,794 --> 00:57:28,695
<i>- It was me!
- I'd like to thank the Academy.</i>

825
00:57:28,764 --> 00:57:32,791
<i>- Is this not a good time for you?
- Just tell him you fucking did it!</i>

826
00:57:32,901 --> 00:57:36,770
Tell him you blew it all up!
That's what he wants to hear.

827
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:41,742
<i>- Are you still there?
- Wait. Are you saying that I'm a suspect?</i>

828
00:57:41,810 --> 00:57:45,804
No. I may need to talk to you, so you
let me know if you're gonna leave town.

829
00:57:45,915 --> 00:57:48,315
<i>- OK?
- OK.</i>

830
00:57:50,988 --> 00:57:55,617
<i>Except for their humping,
Tyler and Marla were never in the same room.</i>

831
00:57:55,725 --> 00:57:58,786
<i>My parents pulled this exact same act
for years.</i>

832
00:57:58,863 --> 00:58:02,629
The condom is the glass slipper
of our generation.

833
00:58:02,733 --> 00:58:05,634
You slip one on when you meet a stranger.

834
00:58:05,736 --> 00:58:07,795
You... dance all night.

835
00:58:07,872 --> 00:58:09,965
Then you throw it away.

836
00:58:10,207 --> 00:58:12,835
The condom, I mean. Not the stranger.

837
00:58:14,378 --> 00:58:15,845
What?

838
00:58:20,685 --> 00:58:23,483
I got this dress at a thrift store for $1.

839
00:58:23,588 --> 00:58:25,452
It was worth every penny.

840
00:58:25,556 --> 00:58:27,616
It's a bridesmaid's dress.

841
00:58:28,593 --> 00:58:31,790
Someone loved it intensely

842
00:58:31,863 --> 00:58:33,888
for one day.

843
00:58:33,999 --> 00:58:36,092
Then tossed it.

844
00:58:37,969 --> 00:58:40,028
Like a Christmas tree.

845
00:58:40,172 --> 00:58:42,265
So special.

846
00:58:42,375 --> 00:58:43,808
Then

847
00:58:43,876 --> 00:58:45,673
bam!

848
00:58:45,778 --> 00:58:47,836
It's on the side of the road.

849
00:58:48,413 --> 00:58:50,507
Tinsel still clinging to it.

850
00:58:52,585 --> 00:58:54,644
Like a sex crime victim.

851
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:56,813
Underwear inside out.

852
00:58:57,491 --> 00:59:01,324
- Bound with electrical tape.
- Well then, it suits you.

853
00:59:01,427 --> 00:59:04,123
You can borrow it sometime.

854
00:59:11,137 --> 00:59:13,231
Get rid of her.

855
00:59:14,007 --> 00:59:16,908
<i>- What? You get rid of her!
- Don't mention me.</i>

856
00:59:17,010 --> 00:59:21,208
<i>I am six years old again,
passing messages between parents.</i>

857
00:59:23,217 --> 00:59:26,813
- I really think it's time you left.
- Don't worry, I'm leaving.

858
00:59:26,888 --> 00:59:31,517
- Not that we don't love your visits.
- You are such a nutcase. I can't keep up.

859
00:59:33,694 --> 00:59:36,562
Gotta get off

860
00:59:36,664 --> 00:59:37,926
Thanks. Bye.

861
00:59:38,032 --> 00:59:43,971
Gotta get off of this merry-go-round

862
00:59:44,739 --> 00:59:48,574
Gonna get, need to get...

863
00:59:48,677 --> 00:59:50,702
Gotta get...

864
00:59:52,914 --> 00:59:54,347
You kids!

865
00:59:56,352 --> 00:59:58,843
Why do you still waste time with her?

866
00:59:58,921 --> 01:00:01,253
I'll say this about Marla.

867
01:00:01,323 --> 01:00:03,588
<i>At least she's trying to hit bottom.</i>

868
01:00:03,693 --> 01:00:04,989
And I'm not?

869
01:00:05,094 --> 01:00:07,927
Feathers up your butt
do not make you a chicken.

870
01:00:07,997 --> 01:00:10,090
What are we doing tonight?

871
01:00:10,767 --> 01:00:12,997
Tonight... we make soap.

872
01:00:13,970 --> 01:00:15,095
Really?

873
01:00:15,204 --> 01:00:18,038
To make soap, first we render fat.

874
01:00:36,927 --> 01:00:39,157
The salt balance has to be just right

875
01:00:39,296 --> 01:00:41,788
so the best fat for soap comes from humans.

876
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:45,694
- Wait, what is this place?
- A liposuction clinic.

877
01:00:53,778 --> 01:00:55,804
Pay dirt!

878
01:00:55,914 --> 01:00:59,747
Richest, creamiest fat in the world.
Fat of the land!

879
01:01:05,357 --> 01:01:08,918
No! Don't pull it, don't pull it!

880
01:01:13,532 --> 01:01:15,796
- Oh, God!
- Give me another one.

881
01:01:21,940 --> 01:01:25,399
As the fat renders,
the tallows float to the surface.

882
01:01:25,478 --> 01:01:27,571
Like in Boy Scouts.

883
01:01:27,647 --> 01:01:31,448
- It's hard to imagine you as a Boy Scout.
- Keep stirring.

884
01:01:33,786 --> 01:01:37,347
Once the tallow hardens,
you skim off a layer of glycerin.

885
01:01:37,423 --> 01:01:39,824
Add nitric acid, you've got nitroglycerin.

886
01:01:39,893 --> 01:01:43,760
Then add sodium nitrate and sawdust,
you've got dynamite.

887
01:01:43,830 --> 01:01:47,665
Yeah, with enough soap,
one could blow up just about anything.

888
01:01:47,768 --> 01:01:49,827
<i>Tyler was full of useful information.</i>

889
01:01:49,903 --> 01:01:53,862
People found clothes got cleaner
when washed at a certain point in the river.

890
01:01:53,974 --> 01:01:55,999
- You know why?
- No.

891
01:01:58,846 --> 01:02:02,647
Human sacrifices were once made
on the hills above this river.

892
01:02:02,717 --> 01:02:05,913
Bodies burnt.
Water permeated the ashes to create lye.

893
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:08,455
This is lye. The crucial ingredient.

894
01:02:08,523 --> 01:02:13,324
Once it mixed with the melted body fat,
a white soapy discharge crept into the river.

895
01:02:13,428 --> 01:02:15,487
May I see your hand, please?

896
01:02:20,869 --> 01:02:24,101
What is this?

897
01:02:24,206 --> 01:02:26,799
This is a chemical burn.

898
01:02:26,875 --> 01:02:30,403
It will hurt more than any burn
and it will leave a scar.

899
01:02:30,479 --> 01:02:33,107
<i>Meditation worked for cancer,
it could work now.</i>

900
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:36,680
- Don't shut the pain out.
- Oh, God!

901
01:02:37,486 --> 01:02:41,923
The first soap was made from heroes' ashes,
like the first monkey shot into space.

902
01:02:42,024 --> 01:02:45,017
Without pain or sacrifice,
we would have nothing.

903
01:02:45,095 --> 01:02:48,030
<i>I tried not to think
of the word searing of flesh.</i>

904
01:02:48,098 --> 01:02:51,260
Stop it!
This is your pain, this is your burning hand.

905
01:02:51,367 --> 01:02:54,030
I'm going to my cave
to find my power animal.

906
01:02:54,104 --> 01:02:58,131
No! Don't deal with this
the way those dead people do! Come on!

907
01:02:58,241 --> 01:03:02,234
- I get the point!
- No! You're feeling premature enlightenment.

908
01:03:05,048 --> 01:03:09,110
It's the greatest moment of your life,
and you're off somewhere else!

909
01:03:09,187 --> 01:03:10,710
I am not!

910
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:13,779
Shut up!
Our fathers were our models for God.

911
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:17,054
If our fathers bailed,
what does that tell you about God?

912
01:03:18,062 --> 01:03:23,295
Listen to me. You have to consider
the possibility that God does not like you.

913
01:03:23,401 --> 01:03:27,497
He never wanted you.
In all probability, He hates you.

914
01:03:27,572 --> 01:03:31,134
This is not the worst thing that can happen.
We don't need Him!

915
01:03:31,210 --> 01:03:34,178
- I agree!
- Fuck damnation, fuck redemption.

916
01:03:34,278 --> 01:03:36,770
We are God's unwanted children? So be it!

917
01:03:36,882 --> 01:03:41,376
- I'm getting water!
- You can use water and make it worse or...

918
01:03:42,521 --> 01:03:46,013
- Or use vinegar to neutralize the burn.
- Please let me up!

919
01:03:46,125 --> 01:03:48,184
First, you have to give up.

920
01:03:48,293 --> 01:03:50,990
First, you have to know, not fear,

921
01:03:51,097 --> 01:03:54,089
know that some day, you're gonna die.

922
01:03:54,167 --> 01:03:56,396
You don't know how this feels!

923
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:04,640
It's only after we've lost everything
that we're free to do anything.

924
01:04:06,646 --> 01:04:08,739
OK.

925
01:04:21,996 --> 01:04:24,021
Congratulations.

926
01:04:24,131 --> 01:04:27,032
You're one step closer to hitting the bottom.

927
01:04:30,070 --> 01:04:33,130
<i>Tyler sold his soap
to department stores at $20 a bar.</i>

928
01:04:33,207 --> 01:04:35,199
<i>God knows what they charged.</i>

929
01:04:35,277 --> 01:04:38,541
- This is the best soap.
- Why, thank you, Susan.

930
01:04:38,612 --> 01:04:40,671
<i>It was beautiful.</i>

931
01:04:40,781 --> 01:04:44,650
<i>We were selling rich women
their own fat asses back to them.</i>

932
01:04:45,654 --> 01:04:47,747
<i>He was wearing his yellow tie.</i>

933
01:04:47,823 --> 01:04:50,087
<i>I didn't wear a tie to work any more.</i>

934
01:04:50,192 --> 01:04:53,821
"The first rule of Fight Club
is don't talk about Fight Club."

935
01:04:53,895 --> 01:04:57,457
<i>I'm half-asleep again.
I must have left it in the copy machine.</i>

936
01:04:57,567 --> 01:05:00,034
"The second rule..." Is this yours?

937
01:05:01,903 --> 01:05:05,465
Pretend you're me.
Make a managerial decision.

938
01:05:05,575 --> 01:05:08,009
You find this. What would you do?

939
01:05:12,648 --> 01:05:14,639
Well, I gotta tell you,

940
01:05:14,717 --> 01:05:18,380
I'd be very, very careful
who you talk to about that.

941
01:05:18,487 --> 01:05:21,787
Because the person who wrote that
is dangerous.

942
01:05:21,859 --> 01:05:26,319
And this button-down, Oxford-cloth psycho
might just snap

943
01:05:26,463 --> 01:05:29,296
and then stalk from office to office

944
01:05:29,399 --> 01:05:34,462
with an Armalite AR10 carbine gas-powered
semiautomatic weapon,

945
01:05:34,538 --> 01:05:38,998
pumping round after round
into colleagues and co-workers.

946
01:05:39,676 --> 01:05:43,044
This might be someone
you've known for years.

947
01:05:43,114 --> 01:05:46,241
Someone very, very close to you.

948
01:05:46,316 --> 01:05:49,718
<i>Tyler's words coming out of my mouth.</i>

949
01:05:50,722 --> 01:05:52,815
<i>And I used to be such a nice guy.</i>

950
01:05:52,891 --> 01:05:56,224
Or maybe you shouldn't bring me
every piece of trash you pick up.

951
01:06:00,064 --> 01:06:03,728
- Compliance and Liability.
- My tit's gonna rot off.

952
01:06:04,670 --> 01:06:07,229
Will you excuse me? I need to take this.

953
01:06:13,512 --> 01:06:17,140
- What do you mean?
- I need you to check for a lump in my breast.

954
01:06:17,248 --> 01:06:21,185
- Go to a hospital.
- I can't afford to waste money on a doctor.

955
01:06:22,154 --> 01:06:24,349
I don't know about this, Marla.

956
01:06:24,456 --> 01:06:26,152
Please.

957
01:06:26,259 --> 01:06:30,251
<i>She didn't call Tyler. I'm neutral in her book.</i>

958
01:06:32,298 --> 01:06:36,326
That's nice.
Taking food to Mrs Haniver and Mrs Raines.

959
01:06:36,403 --> 01:06:38,530
Where are they, exactly?

960
01:06:38,605 --> 01:06:42,735
Tragically, they're dead.
I'm alive and I'm in poverty. Want any?

961
01:06:42,809 --> 01:06:44,902
- No, no.
- I got one for you.

962
01:06:44,978 --> 01:06:47,071
Thanks for the thought.

963
01:06:48,416 --> 01:06:50,747
What happened to your hand?

964
01:06:50,817 --> 01:06:52,978
Oh, nothing.

965
01:06:53,086 --> 01:06:55,146
Right there?

966
01:06:56,190 --> 01:06:58,886
- Feel anything?
- No.

967
01:06:58,993 --> 01:07:00,983
Well, make sure.

968
01:07:01,094 --> 01:07:03,120
OK, I'm pretty sure.

969
01:07:03,197 --> 01:07:05,188
You feel nothing?

970
01:07:05,299 --> 01:07:07,597
No, nothing.

971
01:07:09,136 --> 01:07:11,969
Well, that's a relief. Thank you.

972
01:07:13,574 --> 01:07:16,772
- No problem.
- I wish I could return the favor.

973
01:07:16,845 --> 01:07:18,938
Breast cancer doesn't run in my family.

974
01:07:19,014 --> 01:07:22,506
- I could check your prostate.
- I think I'm OK.

975
01:07:22,617 --> 01:07:24,710
Well, thanks, anyway.

976
01:07:29,725 --> 01:07:32,024
- Are we done?
- Yeah, we're done.

977
01:07:32,128 --> 01:07:34,322
See you... around.

978
01:07:51,539 --> 01:07:53,667
Cornelius?

979
01:07:53,742 --> 01:07:56,107
Cornelius!

980
01:07:56,210 --> 01:07:58,906
It's me! Bob!

981
01:07:59,013 --> 01:08:00,446
Hey, Bob.

982
01:08:04,019 --> 01:08:07,010
- We all thought you were dead.
- No, no. Still here.

983
01:08:07,088 --> 01:08:11,116
- How are you, Bob?
- Better than I've ever been in my whole life.

984
01:08:11,226 --> 01:08:14,718
- Really? Still remaining men together?
- No, no.

985
01:08:14,830 --> 01:08:18,561
- I got something so much better now.
- Really, what is it?

986
01:08:19,234 --> 01:08:21,099
Well...

987
01:08:21,170 --> 01:08:25,437
The first rule is,
I'm not supposed to talk about it.

988
01:08:25,542 --> 01:08:27,669
And the second rule is

989
01:08:27,744 --> 01:08:30,042
I'm not supposed to talk about it.

990
01:08:30,113 --> 01:08:33,549
- And the third rule is...
- Bob, Bob. I'm a member.

991
01:08:33,683 --> 01:08:35,742
Look at my face, Bob.

992
01:08:38,155 --> 01:08:40,486
That's fucking... fucking great.

993
01:08:40,557 --> 01:08:44,288
- I've never seen you there.
- I go Tuesdays and Thursdays.

994
01:08:44,361 --> 01:08:48,093
- I go Saturday.
- Congratulations.

995
01:08:48,499 --> 01:08:50,864
Yeah, hey, to both of us, right?

996
01:08:50,934 --> 01:08:53,563
Have you heard about the guy
that invented it?

997
01:08:53,704 --> 01:08:56,571
- Yeah, actually...
- I hear all kinds of things.

998
01:08:56,707 --> 01:09:00,303
Supposedly,
he was born in a mental institution

999
01:09:00,379 --> 01:09:03,779
and he sleeps only one hour a night.

1000
01:09:03,881 --> 01:09:06,076
He's a great man.

1001
01:09:07,552 --> 01:09:09,884
Do you know about Tyler Durden?

1002
01:09:34,846 --> 01:09:36,940
I didn't hurt you, did I?

1003
01:09:37,016 --> 01:09:39,109
Actually, you did.

1004
01:09:39,185 --> 01:09:41,244
Thank you for this.

1005
01:09:41,521 --> 01:09:43,922
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1006
01:09:43,991 --> 01:09:46,049
<i>Fight Club.</i>

1007
01:09:46,159 --> 01:09:48,252
<i>This was mine and Tyler's gift.</i>

1008
01:09:48,461 --> 01:09:50,429
<i>Our gift to the world.</i>

1009
01:09:50,530 --> 01:09:53,864
I look around, I look around,
I see a lot of new faces.

1010
01:09:55,469 --> 01:09:57,663
Shut up!

1011
01:09:57,804 --> 01:10:02,640
Which means a lot of people have been
breaking the first two rules of Fight Club.

1012
01:10:10,984 --> 01:10:15,046
I see in Fight Club the strongest
and smartest men who've ever lived.

1013
01:10:15,156 --> 01:10:17,215
I see all this potential.

1014
01:10:17,292 --> 01:10:19,384
And I see it squandered.

1015
01:10:20,395 --> 01:10:23,489
Goddamn it,
an entire generation pumping gas.

1016
01:10:24,065 --> 01:10:26,158
Waiting tables.

1017
01:10:26,234 --> 01:10:28,294
Slaves with white collars.

1018
01:10:30,805 --> 01:10:33,865
Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes.

1019
01:10:33,975 --> 01:10:37,241
Working jobs we hate
so we can buy shit we don't need.

1020
01:10:41,115 --> 01:10:43,584
We're the middle children of history.

1021
01:10:43,652 --> 01:10:45,711
No purpose or place.

1022
01:10:45,921 --> 01:10:48,014
We have no Great War.

1023
01:10:48,324 --> 01:10:50,418
No Great Depression.

1024
01:10:52,194 --> 01:10:54,526
Our great war is a spiritual war.

1025
01:10:54,997 --> 01:10:58,331
Our great depression is our lives.

1026
01:11:01,204 --> 01:11:04,264
We've all been raised
on television to believe

1027
01:11:04,341 --> 01:11:08,038
that one day we'd be millionaires
and movie gods and rock stars.

1028
01:11:08,111 --> 01:11:10,204
But we won't.

1029
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:12,715
We're slowly learning that fact.

1030
01:11:12,850 --> 01:11:15,283
And we're very, very pissed off.

1031
01:11:15,352 --> 01:11:17,013
Yeah!

1032
01:11:19,924 --> 01:11:24,360
- First rule of Fight Club is, do not talk...

1033
01:11:29,867 --> 01:11:31,129
Who are you?

1034
01:11:31,969 --> 01:11:34,564
- Who am I?
- Yeah.

1035
01:11:35,473 --> 01:11:38,306
There's a sign on the front
that says Lou's Tavern.

1036
01:11:39,377 --> 01:11:43,280
I'm fucking Lou. Who the fuck are you?

1037
01:11:43,348 --> 01:11:45,441
Tyler Durden.

1038
01:11:48,554 --> 01:11:52,046
Who told you motherfuckers
that you could use my place?

1039
01:11:52,124 --> 01:11:54,490
We have a deal worked out with Irvine.

1040
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:57,154
Irvine's at home with a broken collarbone.

1041
01:11:57,262 --> 01:11:59,389
He don't own this place. I do.

1042
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:05,060
- How much money's he getting for this?
- There is no money.

1043
01:12:05,138 --> 01:12:07,935
- Free to all.
- Ain't that something?

1044
01:12:08,006 --> 01:12:09,871
It is, actually.

1045
01:12:09,942 --> 01:12:12,377
Look, stupid fuck!

1046
01:12:12,478 --> 01:12:15,003
- I want everybody out of here right now.
- Hey!

1047
01:12:15,114 --> 01:12:17,344
You should join our club.

1048
01:12:17,718 --> 01:12:19,708
Did you hear what I just said?

1049
01:12:19,786 --> 01:12:21,913
You and your friend.

1050
01:12:23,790 --> 01:12:25,918
You hear me now?

1051
01:12:28,128 --> 01:12:30,186
No, I didn't quite catch that, Lou.

1052
01:12:36,337 --> 01:12:38,328
Still not getting it.

1053
01:12:39,373 --> 01:12:41,534
OK, OK, I got it.

1054
01:12:41,609 --> 01:12:44,100
I got it, I got it. Shit, I lost it.

1055
01:12:45,145 --> 01:12:47,010
Back! All of you!

1056
01:12:48,717 --> 01:12:50,776
Everybody back!

1057
01:12:58,259 --> 01:13:00,420
Ah, Lou!

1058
01:13:00,528 --> 01:13:04,191
Come on, man!
We really like this place.

1059
01:13:13,242 --> 01:13:16,176
- That's right, Lou. Get it out.
- Shut the fuck up.

1060
01:13:16,277 --> 01:13:18,075
Oh, yeah!

1061
01:13:23,052 --> 01:13:25,145
Is that fucking funny?

1062
01:13:34,698 --> 01:13:37,291
Fucking guy is a loony, I'm telling you.

1063
01:13:38,167 --> 01:13:39,829
Unbelievable.

1064
01:13:44,074 --> 01:13:47,043
- You don't know where I've been, Lou.
- Oh, my God!

1065
01:13:47,110 --> 01:13:50,011
You don't know where I've been!

1066
01:13:53,083 --> 01:13:56,178
Please let us keep it, Lou! Please, Lou!

1067
01:13:56,254 --> 01:13:58,687
Fucking use the basement! Christ!

1068
01:13:58,789 --> 01:14:01,657
I want your word, Lou! I want your word!

1069
01:14:01,726 --> 01:14:03,717
On my mother's eyes.

1070
01:14:12,870 --> 01:14:14,997
Thanks, Lou.

1071
01:14:16,308 --> 01:14:18,401
You too, big guy.

1072
01:14:22,346 --> 01:14:24,440
We'll see you next week.

1073
01:14:39,933 --> 01:14:43,527
This week, each one of you
has a homework assignment.

1074
01:14:43,635 --> 01:14:48,471
You're gonna go out. You're gonna
start a fight with a total stranger.

1075
01:14:51,711 --> 01:14:53,872
You're gonna start a fight

1076
01:14:53,980 --> 01:14:56,073
and you're gonna lose.

1077
01:14:58,051 --> 01:14:59,986
Excellent choice, sir.

1078
01:15:02,556 --> 01:15:05,854
Hey! Watch out, jackass! Come on!

1079
01:15:06,259 --> 01:15:08,888
<i>Now, this is not as easy as it sounds.</i>

1080
01:15:11,599 --> 01:15:13,567
Son of a bitch!

1081
01:15:13,667 --> 01:15:18,400
<i>Most people, normal people,
do just about anything to avoid a fight.</i>

1082
01:15:19,340 --> 01:15:21,400
Excuse me!

1083
01:15:21,510 --> 01:15:25,207
You sprayed me with your hose.
That's not necessary...

1084
01:15:25,313 --> 01:15:27,212
Jay! Go call 911!

1085
01:15:29,951 --> 01:15:32,010
Put the hose down.

1086
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:34,179
Stop it! Stop it!

1087
01:15:35,824 --> 01:15:37,724
Sorry.

1088
01:15:53,242 --> 01:15:55,710
We need to talk.

1089
01:15:57,947 --> 01:16:00,040
OK.

1090
01:16:00,149 --> 01:16:02,208
Where to begin?

1091
01:16:02,318 --> 01:16:04,513
With your constant absenteeism?

1092
01:16:04,587 --> 01:16:07,148
With your unpresentable appearance?

1093
01:16:07,224 --> 01:16:09,249
You're up for review.

1094
01:16:09,358 --> 01:16:12,555
I am Jack's complete lack of surprise.

1095
01:16:12,628 --> 01:16:14,563
- What?
- Let's pretend.

1096
01:16:14,631 --> 01:16:17,532
You're the Department of Transportation,
OK?

1097
01:16:17,601 --> 01:16:21,264
Someone informs you that this company

1098
01:16:21,371 --> 01:16:25,432
installs front-seat mounting brackets
that failed collision tests,

1099
01:16:25,542 --> 01:16:28,944
brake linings that fail after 1,000 miles,

1100
01:16:29,013 --> 01:16:33,449
and fuel injectors
that explode and burn people alive.

1101
01:16:33,550 --> 01:16:35,416
What then?

1102
01:16:35,486 --> 01:16:37,784
Are you threatening me?

1103
01:16:37,856 --> 01:16:40,654
- No...
- Get the fuck out of here. You're fired!

1104
01:16:40,758 --> 01:16:45,195
I have a better solution. Keep me
on the payroll as an outside consultant.

1105
01:16:45,263 --> 01:16:47,356
In exchange for my salary,

1106
01:16:47,432 --> 01:16:51,267
my job will be never to tell people
these things that I know.

1107
01:16:51,370 --> 01:16:55,635
I don't even have to come into the office.
I can do this job from home.

1108
01:16:56,909 --> 01:17:01,039
Who... Who the fuck do you think you are,
you crazy little shit?

1109
01:17:06,318 --> 01:17:09,845
<i>- Security!
- I am Jack's smirking revenge.</i>

1110
01:17:18,831 --> 01:17:20,925
What the hell are you doing?

1111
01:17:30,143 --> 01:17:32,236
That hurt.

1112
01:17:33,681 --> 01:17:35,740
Why would you do that?

1113
01:17:36,417 --> 01:17:39,408
Oh, my God! No! Please stop!

1114
01:17:48,763 --> 01:17:50,856
What are you doing?

1115
01:17:51,933 --> 01:17:54,026
Oh, God, no! Please! No!

1116
01:17:54,101 --> 01:17:58,232
<i>For some reason,
I thought of my first fight, with Tyler.</i>

1117
01:17:58,307 --> 01:17:59,898
No!

1118
01:18:24,333 --> 01:18:28,794
<i>Under and behind and inside
everything this man took for granted,</i>

1119
01:18:28,905 --> 01:18:32,363
<i>something horrible had been growing.</i>

1120
01:18:32,475 --> 01:18:33,533
Look.

1121
01:18:33,609 --> 01:18:38,342
Give me the paychecks, like I asked,
and you won't ever see me again.

1122
01:18:38,414 --> 01:18:41,213
<i>Then, at our most excellent
moment together...</i>

1123
01:18:44,287 --> 01:18:47,017
Thank God!
Please don't hit me again.

1124
01:18:47,124 --> 01:18:49,217
<i>Telephone, computer,</i>

1125
01:18:49,326 --> 01:18:54,491
<i>fax machine, 52 weekly paychecks
and 48 airline flight coupons.</i>

1126
01:18:54,565 --> 01:18:56,965
<i>We now had corporate sponsorship.</i>

1127
01:18:57,034 --> 01:19:02,200
<i>This is how Tyler and I were able to have
Fight Club every night of the week.</i>

1128
01:19:04,842 --> 01:19:08,437
<i>Now, the center of Fight Club
became the two men fighting.</i>

1129
01:19:08,545 --> 01:19:12,004
<i>The leader walked through the crowd,
out in the darkness.</i>

1130
01:19:13,785 --> 01:19:18,313
<i>Tyler was now involved in
a lawsuit with the Pressman Hotel</i>

1131
01:19:18,390 --> 01:19:20,654
<i>over the urine content of their soup.</i>

1132
01:19:25,831 --> 01:19:28,822
<i>I am Jack's wasted life.</i>

1133
01:19:36,575 --> 01:19:38,634
Thank you, sir.

1134
01:19:40,146 --> 01:19:43,138
<i>Tyler dreamed up
new homework assignments.</i>

1135
01:19:43,249 --> 01:19:45,774
<i>He handed them out in sealed envelopes.</i>

1136
01:20:24,926 --> 01:20:28,623
- There's a Fight Club up in Delaware City.
- Yeah, I heard.

1137
01:20:30,432 --> 01:20:32,626
There's one in Penns Grove too.

1138
01:20:32,700 --> 01:20:34,930
Bob even found one up in New Castle.

1139
01:20:35,036 --> 01:20:38,097
- Did you start that one?
- No, I thought you did.

1140
01:20:38,207 --> 01:20:40,698
No.

1141
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:31,755
- Stop for a second.
- Hey, what are we doing?

1142
01:21:31,862 --> 01:21:33,887
- Turn around.
- What are we doing?

1143
01:21:33,964 --> 01:21:36,399
- Homework assignment.
- What kind?

1144
01:21:36,501 --> 01:21:38,525
Human sacrifice.

1145
01:21:38,602 --> 01:21:41,935
- Is that a gun? Please tell me it's not.
- It's a gun.

1146
01:21:42,006 --> 01:21:44,373
- What are you doing?
- Meet me in the back.

1147
01:21:44,476 --> 01:21:46,808
- Don't fuck around!
- Meet me in the back.

1148
01:21:46,912 --> 01:21:48,709
<i>On a long enough time line,</i>

1149
01:21:48,780 --> 01:21:51,681
<i>the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.</i>

1150
01:21:52,684 --> 01:21:54,743
What are you doing? Come on!

1151
01:21:54,819 --> 01:21:58,221
Hands behind your back.
Give me your wallet.

1152
01:21:59,992 --> 01:22:03,290
Raymond K Hessel.
1320 SE Banning, Apartment A.

1153
01:22:04,095 --> 01:22:07,293
- Small, cramped basement apartment?
- How did you know?

1154
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:09,994
They give shitty apartments letters.

1155
01:22:10,102 --> 01:22:13,196
Raymond! You're going to die.

1156
01:22:13,306 --> 01:22:14,773
No!

1157
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:19,004
Is that your mom and dad?
They're gonna have to call the kindly doctor.

1158
01:22:19,111 --> 01:22:21,376
Pick up your dental records. Know why?

1159
01:22:21,448 --> 01:22:25,008
- There'll be nothing left of your face.
- Oh, come on!

1160
01:22:25,117 --> 01:22:29,020
An expired community college student ID.
What did you study, Raymond?

1161
01:22:29,122 --> 01:22:32,148
- S... S... Stuff.
- Stuff?

1162
01:22:32,226 --> 01:22:34,318
Were the midterms hard?

1163
01:22:35,462 --> 01:22:38,022
- I asked you what you studied!
- Biology, mostly.

1164
01:22:38,131 --> 01:22:41,623
- Why?
- I don't know.

1165
01:22:41,735 --> 01:22:44,727
What did you wanna be, Raymond K Hessel?!

1166
01:22:46,139 --> 01:22:50,076
The question, Raymond,
was what did you want to be?

1167
01:22:51,779 --> 01:22:53,838
Answer him, Raymond, Jesus!

1168
01:22:53,948 --> 01:22:56,347
- Veterinarian. Veterinarian.
- Animals.

1169
01:22:56,450 --> 01:22:59,420
- Yeah. Animals and stuff.
- Stuff. Yeah, I got that.

1170
01:22:59,487 --> 01:23:02,047
- So you need more schooling.
- Too much school.

1171
01:23:02,156 --> 01:23:04,625
- Would you rather be dead?
- No, please...

1172
01:23:04,693 --> 01:23:09,152
You'd rather die here, on your knees,
in the back of a convenience store?

1173
01:23:09,230 --> 01:23:10,857
Please, no.

1174
01:23:14,970 --> 01:23:17,029
I'm keeping your license.

1175
01:23:18,273 --> 01:23:21,266
Gonna check in on you.
I know where you live.

1176
01:23:21,377 --> 01:23:24,369
If you're not working
to be a veterinarian in six weeks,

1177
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:26,574
you will be dead.

1178
01:23:28,450 --> 01:23:30,509
Now run on home.

1179
01:23:35,258 --> 01:23:37,317
Run, Forrest, run!

1180
01:23:38,995 --> 01:23:41,054
I feel ill.

1181
01:23:41,865 --> 01:23:43,924
Imagine how he feels.

1182
01:23:44,034 --> 01:23:46,093
Come on, this isn't funny!

1183
01:23:46,202 --> 01:23:48,637
What the fuck was the point of that?!

1184
01:23:48,706 --> 01:23:52,835
Tomorrow will be the most beautiful day
of Raymond K Hessel's life.

1185
01:23:52,909 --> 01:23:57,279
His breakfast will taste better
than any meal you and I have ever tasted.

1186
01:23:58,716 --> 01:24:00,809
<i>You had to give it to him.</i>

1187
01:24:00,885 --> 01:24:03,251
<i>- Come on.
- He had a plan.</i>

1188
01:24:03,321 --> 01:24:06,757
<i>And it started to make sense
in a Tyler-sort of way.</i>

1189
01:24:06,857 --> 01:24:08,757
<i>No fear. No distractions.</i>

1190
01:24:08,859 --> 01:24:12,158
<i>The ability to let that which does not matter</i>

1191
01:24:12,263 --> 01:24:14,254
<i>truly slide.</i>

1192
01:24:27,679 --> 01:24:29,772
<i>You are not your job.</i>

1193
01:24:31,717 --> 01:24:35,084
You're not how much money
you have in the bank.

1194
01:24:36,788 --> 01:24:38,881
You're not the car you drive.

1195
01:24:39,391 --> 01:24:42,259
You're not the contents of your wallet.

1196
01:24:42,328 --> 01:24:44,660
You're not your fucking khakis.

1197
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:51,163
You are the all-singing,
all-dancing crap of the world.

1198
01:25:00,012 --> 01:25:02,208
I'll be out of your way in a sec.

1199
01:25:03,016 --> 01:25:05,109
You don't have to go.

1200
01:25:06,620 --> 01:25:08,712
Whatever.

1201
01:25:09,823 --> 01:25:12,917
No, I mean... It's OK.

1202
01:25:22,436 --> 01:25:24,564
Are you still going to groups?

1203
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:27,333
Yeah.

1204
01:25:28,809 --> 01:25:30,902
Chloe's dead.

1205
01:25:31,379 --> 01:25:33,370
Wow, Chloe.

1206
01:25:33,448 --> 01:25:35,382
When did that happen?

1207
01:25:35,950 --> 01:25:37,815
Do you care?

1208
01:25:37,919 --> 01:25:41,252
I dunno. I haven't thought about it in a while.

1209
01:25:41,556 --> 01:25:43,615
Yeah, well...

1210
01:25:43,725 --> 01:25:46,058
It was the smart move on her part.

1211
01:25:47,430 --> 01:25:49,455
Listen...

1212
01:25:50,765 --> 01:25:53,132
What are you getting out of all this?

1213
01:25:53,836 --> 01:25:55,929
What?

1214
01:25:56,038 --> 01:25:58,370
I mean, all this. Why do you keep...

1215
01:25:59,141 --> 01:26:01,201
Is this making you happy?

1216
01:26:02,812 --> 01:26:04,871
Yeah, well, sometimes.

1217
01:26:06,615 --> 01:26:08,743
I don't know. I don't understand.

1218
01:26:08,819 --> 01:26:12,380
Why does a weaker person
need to latch on to a strong person?

1219
01:26:12,456 --> 01:26:14,582
What is... What is that?

1220
01:26:14,657 --> 01:26:16,819
What do you get out of it?

1221
01:26:18,295 --> 01:26:20,388
No... That's not the same thing at all.

1222
01:26:20,464 --> 01:26:22,592
It's totally different with us.

1223
01:26:22,667 --> 01:26:24,759
Us?

1224
01:26:24,835 --> 01:26:26,769
What do you mean by us?

1225
01:26:26,837 --> 01:26:30,706
- I'm sorry. Do you hear this?
- Hear what?

1226
01:26:30,808 --> 01:26:32,833
- All that noise. Hold on.
- No, wait!

1227
01:26:32,910 --> 01:26:35,639
Don't change the subject!
I want to talk about this.

1228
01:26:35,712 --> 01:26:38,477
- You're not talking about me, are you?
- No.

1229
01:26:38,616 --> 01:26:42,052
- What?
- Playing doctor. What was going on there?

1230
01:26:42,119 --> 01:26:45,385
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing. Nothing.

1231
01:26:45,457 --> 01:26:47,515
- I don't think so.
- What do you want?

1232
01:26:47,658 --> 01:26:50,058
- Look at me.
- No. What?

1233
01:26:50,828 --> 01:26:53,662
- What is that?!
- It's nothing. Don't worry.

1234
01:26:53,732 --> 01:26:56,132
My God. Who did this?

1235
01:26:56,235 --> 01:26:58,293
- A person.
- Guy or girl?

1236
01:26:58,402 --> 01:27:01,201
- What do you care?
- What do you care if I ask?

1237
01:27:01,273 --> 01:27:03,867
- Leave me alone.
- You're afraid to say.

1238
01:27:03,942 --> 01:27:05,933
- I am not. Let me go.
- No! Talk to me.

1239
01:27:06,044 --> 01:27:07,205
Let go of me!

1240
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:10,009
- This conversation
- This conversation

1241
01:27:10,082 --> 01:27:12,550
- is over.
- is over.

1242
01:27:13,418 --> 01:27:16,513
I just can't win with you, can I?

1243
01:27:25,865 --> 01:27:28,333
Hey, this is getting a little old!

1244
01:27:28,936 --> 01:27:31,267
What is... What is all this?

1245
01:27:31,337 --> 01:27:33,430
What do you think?

1246
01:27:34,374 --> 01:27:36,502
Hey, why do we need bunk beds?

1247
01:27:36,577 --> 01:27:38,442
Hey!

1248
01:27:45,286 --> 01:27:47,117
Too young.

1249
01:27:47,187 --> 01:27:48,848
Sorry.

1250
01:27:48,923 --> 01:27:50,983
What's all that?

1251
01:27:51,092 --> 01:27:54,060
If the applicant is young,
tell him he's too young.

1252
01:27:54,128 --> 01:27:56,756
- Old, too old. Fat, too fat.
- Applicant?

1253
01:27:56,864 --> 01:28:00,198
If the applicant waits three days
without food or shelter,

1254
01:28:00,302 --> 01:28:02,361
he may enter and begin training.

1255
01:28:02,469 --> 01:28:04,300
Training for what?

1256
01:28:09,911 --> 01:28:11,970
You think this is a game?

1257
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:14,742
You're too young to train here, end of story.

1258
01:28:14,816 --> 01:28:17,546
Quit wasting our time.
Get the fuck out of here.

1259
01:28:21,490 --> 01:28:23,549
Bad news, friend.

1260
01:28:23,826 --> 01:28:25,918
It's not gonna happen.

1261
01:28:25,994 --> 01:28:28,293
Sorry if there was a misunderstanding.

1262
01:28:28,364 --> 01:28:30,298
It's not the end of the world.

1263
01:28:30,366 --> 01:28:32,561
Just... go away.

1264
01:28:33,436 --> 01:28:35,495
Go.

1265
01:28:35,571 --> 01:28:39,234
You're trespassing
and I will have to call the police.

1266
01:28:42,346 --> 01:28:44,405
Don't you look at me!

1267
01:28:44,514 --> 01:28:47,778
You're never getting in this fucking house!

1268
01:28:47,850 --> 01:28:51,218
Never. Now get the fuck off my porch!
Get off my porch!

1269
01:28:51,321 --> 01:28:54,848
<i>Sooner or later,
we all became what Tyler wanted us to be.</i>

1270
01:28:54,958 --> 01:28:57,791
I'm gonna go inside
and I'm gonna get a shovel.

1271
01:29:05,336 --> 01:29:07,531
- Got two black shirts?
- Yes, sir.

1272
01:29:07,605 --> 01:29:09,868
- Two pair of black pants?
- Yes, sir.

1273
01:29:09,973 --> 01:29:12,943
- One pair black boots? Black socks?
- Yes, sir.

1274
01:29:13,011 --> 01:29:15,070
- One blackjacket.
- Yes, sir.

1275
01:29:15,179 --> 01:29:18,171
- $300 personal burial money?
- Yes, sir.

1276
01:29:20,351 --> 01:29:22,410
All right.

1277
01:29:32,230 --> 01:29:34,290
You're too old, fat man.

1278
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:37,563
Your tits are too big.
Get the fuck off my porch.

1279
01:29:45,377 --> 01:29:47,436
Bob! Bob!

1280
01:30:03,430 --> 01:30:06,092
Like a monkey ready to be shot into space.

1281
01:30:06,866 --> 01:30:08,333
Space monkey.

1282
01:30:08,435 --> 01:30:11,928
Ready to sacrifice himself
for the greater good.

1283
01:30:18,546 --> 01:30:21,242
You are too fucking old, fatty!

1284
01:30:21,315 --> 01:30:24,512
And you... You're too fucking

1285
01:30:24,618 --> 01:30:26,245
blond!

1286
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:28,652
Get out of here, the both of you!

1287
01:30:28,723 --> 01:30:30,850
<i>And so it went.</i>

1288
01:30:31,025 --> 01:30:33,119
Listen up, maggots.

1289
01:30:33,228 --> 01:30:35,287
You are not special.

1290
01:30:35,630 --> 01:30:38,928
You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake.

1291
01:30:39,033 --> 01:30:43,368
You are the same decaying organic matter
as everything else.

1292
01:30:43,472 --> 01:30:45,565
<i>Tyler built himself an army.</i>

1293
01:30:45,841 --> 01:30:49,470
<i>We are the all-singing,
all-dancing crap of the world.</i>

1294
01:30:49,544 --> 01:30:53,173
<i>We are all part of the same compost heap.</i>

1295
01:30:54,249 --> 01:30:57,481
<i>Why was Tyler Durden building an army?</i>

1296
01:30:57,553 --> 01:30:59,645
<i>To what purpose?</i>

1297
01:30:59,721 --> 01:31:02,156
<i>For what greater good?</i>

1298
01:31:05,495 --> 01:31:07,554
<i>In Tyler we trusted.</i>

1299
01:31:12,902 --> 01:31:15,564
When he was like,
"You are not yourjob",

1300
01:31:15,671 --> 01:31:17,731
I was like, "Yeah!"

1301
01:31:19,610 --> 01:31:21,702
Hey, what's all this?

1302
01:31:21,811 --> 01:31:23,905
Hey!

1303
01:31:25,382 --> 01:31:27,077
OK!

1304
01:31:27,151 --> 01:31:29,517
- What's going on?
- We're celebrating.

1305
01:31:29,586 --> 01:31:32,111
- What are we celebrating?
- Go on.

1306
01:31:36,126 --> 01:31:38,287
- Hey.
- Let me get that for you.

1307
01:31:42,900 --> 01:31:45,768
<i>The same great taste, Pepsi.</i>

1308
01:31:48,139 --> 01:31:50,369
Ssh!

1309
01:31:50,441 --> 01:31:54,241
<i>Investigators are here.
The Police Commissioner has arrived.</i>

1310
01:31:54,345 --> 01:31:57,314
<i>Could you tell us
what you think has happened here?</i>

1311
01:31:57,382 --> 01:32:01,615
<i>We believe this is one of many
recent acts of vandalism in the city</i>

1312
01:32:01,720 --> 01:32:04,847
<i>somehow related
to underground boxing clubs.</i>

1313
01:32:04,956 --> 01:32:09,155
<i>We will be coordinating
a rigorous investigation.</i>

1314
01:32:10,062 --> 01:32:14,431
<i>That was Police Commissioner Jacobs
who just arrived on the scene</i>

1315
01:32:14,533 --> 01:32:18,765
<i>- of a four-alarm fire that broke out...
- She's hot.</i>

1316
01:32:18,871 --> 01:32:20,668
<i>Back to you in the studio.</i>

1317
01:32:20,773 --> 01:32:23,174
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1318
01:32:24,144 --> 01:32:26,634
- Holy shit!
- Yeah!

1319
01:32:33,987 --> 01:32:36,012
What the fuck did you guys do?

1320
01:32:36,089 --> 01:32:40,185
<i>Arson investigators
are on the premises...</i>

1321
01:32:43,964 --> 01:32:48,492
Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem
is you do not ask questions, sir.

1322
01:32:54,709 --> 01:32:57,234
The victory in the war against crime

1323
01:32:57,311 --> 01:32:59,404
will not come overnight.

1324
01:32:59,480 --> 01:33:04,042
It will take dedication and commitment
and, most of all, cooperation.

1325
01:33:04,118 --> 01:33:09,056
Streets are safer now.
There is hope in the inner city. However...

1326
01:33:09,124 --> 01:33:11,114
I gotta take a piss.

1327
01:33:11,225 --> 01:33:13,990
These are the first steps in a long journey.

1328
01:33:14,062 --> 01:33:16,656
That is why we have created Project Hope.

1329
01:33:16,732 --> 01:33:18,825
Bob.

1330
01:33:21,937 --> 01:33:24,701
Project Hope will be ajoint effort

1331
01:33:24,806 --> 01:33:27,536
between the police and community leaders.

1332
01:33:27,643 --> 01:33:31,807
It will be a powerful new weapon
in the war against crime.

1333
01:34:17,261 --> 01:34:21,392
- Wrap it around the top of his Hacky Sack.
- His balls are ice cold.

1334
01:34:23,401 --> 01:34:26,733
Hi. You're gonna call off
your rigorous investigation.

1335
01:34:26,804 --> 01:34:30,172
You will publicly state
there is no underground group or

1336
01:34:30,275 --> 01:34:32,573
these guys are gonna take your balls.

1337
01:34:33,478 --> 01:34:37,279
<i>They'll send one to the New York Times
and one to the LA Times.</i>

1338
01:34:37,350 --> 01:34:39,112
Look.

1339
01:34:39,184 --> 01:34:42,279
The people you are after
are the people you depend on.

1340
01:34:42,355 --> 01:34:45,916
We cook your meals. We haul your trash.
We connect your calls.

1341
01:34:46,025 --> 01:34:49,756
We drive your ambulances.
We guard you while you sleep.

1342
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:56,999
Do not fuck with us.

1343
01:35:04,411 --> 01:35:06,538
Ball check!

1344
01:35:20,862 --> 01:35:22,954
Bob, you're this way.

1345
01:35:24,064 --> 01:35:26,397
Let's go.

1346
01:35:26,467 --> 01:35:29,664
<i>I am Jack's inflamed sense of rejection.</i>

1347
01:35:30,772 --> 01:35:32,830
Hey!

1348
01:35:47,355 --> 01:35:48,618
Yeah!

1349
01:36:21,391 --> 01:36:24,189
<i>I felt like putting a bullet in every panda</i>

1350
01:36:24,260 --> 01:36:28,128
<i>that wouldn't screw to save its species.</i>

1351
01:36:30,266 --> 01:36:33,031
<i>I wanted to open the dump valves
on oil tankers</i>

1352
01:36:33,137 --> 01:36:36,004
<i>and smother those French beaches
I'd never see.</i>

1353
01:36:39,275 --> 01:36:41,744
<i>I wanted to breathe smoke.</i>

1354
01:36:59,131 --> 01:37:01,257
Where did you go, psycho boy?

1355
01:37:02,968 --> 01:37:05,903
I felt like destroying something beautiful.

1356
01:37:09,442 --> 01:37:11,500
Get him to a fucking hospital.

1357
01:37:11,576 --> 01:37:13,669
Yeah.

1358
01:37:24,457 --> 01:37:27,517
Don't worry, Mr Durden.
Airport parking. Long term.

1359
01:37:28,995 --> 01:37:31,123
After you, Mr Durden.

1360
01:37:32,065 --> 01:37:34,157
After you.

1361
01:37:51,919 --> 01:37:54,514
- Something on your mind, dear?
- No.

1362
01:37:54,589 --> 01:37:57,819
Yeah, why wasn't I told
about Project Mayhem?

1363
01:37:57,925 --> 01:38:00,918
First rule of Project Mayhem
is you do not ask questions.

1364
01:38:00,995 --> 01:38:03,395
Why didn't you include me in the beginning?

1365
01:38:03,498 --> 01:38:08,697
Fight Club was the beginning. Now it's left
the basements and it's Project Mayhem.

1366
01:38:08,770 --> 01:38:13,173
We started Fight Club together. Remember?
It's as much mine as it is yours.

1367
01:38:13,241 --> 01:38:17,507
- Is this about you and me?
- Yeah. Weren't we doing this together?

1368
01:38:17,579 --> 01:38:21,015
This does not belong to us.
We are not special.

1369
01:38:21,115 --> 01:38:23,550
Fuck that. You should have told me.

1370
01:38:24,386 --> 01:38:26,377
Hey, Tyler!

1371
01:38:28,223 --> 01:38:30,715
- Goddamn it, Tyler!
- What do you want?!

1372
01:38:30,793 --> 01:38:33,261
A statement of purpose?
Should I e-mail you?

1373
01:38:33,362 --> 01:38:35,990
- Oh...
- You decide your level of involvement!

1374
01:38:36,065 --> 01:38:38,761
I will! I wanna know certain things first!

1375
01:38:38,834 --> 01:38:41,462
- The first rule of Project Mayhem...
- Shut up!

1376
01:38:43,239 --> 01:38:46,971
- I wanna know what you're thinking.
- Fuck what you know!

1377
01:38:47,043 --> 01:38:50,534
Forget about what you think you know
about life, friendship,

1378
01:38:50,613 --> 01:38:52,673
and especially about you and me.

1379
01:38:53,850 --> 01:38:56,011
What is that supposed to mean?

1380
01:38:59,423 --> 01:39:01,583
What are you doing?

1381
01:39:02,492 --> 01:39:05,222
What do you wish you'd done
before you died?

1382
01:39:05,295 --> 01:39:08,163
- Paint a self-portrait.
- Build a house.

1383
01:39:08,266 --> 01:39:10,632
- And you?
- I don't know. Nothing.

1384
01:39:10,701 --> 01:39:13,100
- Get in the right lane.
- You have to know!

1385
01:39:13,236 --> 01:39:16,263
If you died now,
how would you feel about your life?

1386
01:39:16,374 --> 01:39:20,003
I don't know! Nothing good.
Is that what you want to hear?

1387
01:39:20,077 --> 01:39:22,410
- Come on!
- Not good enough.

1388
01:39:22,481 --> 01:39:24,914
Stop fucking around! Tyler!

1389
01:39:26,183 --> 01:39:28,447
Jesus Christ!

1390
01:39:29,187 --> 01:39:31,280
Goddamn it! Goddamn it! Fuck you!

1391
01:39:31,390 --> 01:39:33,449
Fuck Fight Club. Fuck Marla!

1392
01:39:33,525 --> 01:39:36,187
I am sick of all your shit!

1393
01:39:36,295 --> 01:39:38,195
OK, man.

1394
01:39:39,998 --> 01:39:42,523
- Quit screwing around. Steer!
- Look at you!

1395
01:39:42,634 --> 01:39:45,398
- Steer!
- Look at you. You're fucking pathetic!

1396
01:39:45,470 --> 01:39:50,602
- Why? Why? What are you talking about?
- Why do you think I blew up your condo?

1397
01:39:51,210 --> 01:39:52,734
What?

1398
01:39:52,845 --> 01:39:56,746
Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat.
It's not a goddamned seminar.

1399
01:39:56,848 --> 01:40:00,546
Stop trying to control everything
and just let go!

1400
01:40:02,288 --> 01:40:04,119
Let go!

1401
01:40:04,223 --> 01:40:06,317
All right. Fine.

1402
01:40:07,160 --> 01:40:09,094
Fine.

1403
01:41:07,490 --> 01:41:09,958
<i>I'd never been in a car accident.</i>

1404
01:41:10,025 --> 01:41:13,483
<i>This must have been
what all those people felt like</i>

1405
01:41:13,562 --> 01:41:16,759
<i>before I filed them
as statistics in my reports.</i>

1406
01:41:16,832 --> 01:41:18,926
Goddamn!

1407
01:41:22,439 --> 01:41:25,601
We've just had a near-life experience!

1408
01:41:29,446 --> 01:41:31,437
In the world I see,

1409
01:41:31,548 --> 01:41:35,416
you're stalking elk
through the Grand Canyon forests

1410
01:41:35,519 --> 01:41:38,511
around the ruins of Rockefeller Center.

1411
01:41:40,524 --> 01:41:44,859
You'll wear leather clothes
that will last you the rest of your life.

1412
01:41:44,962 --> 01:41:49,524
You'll climb the thick kudzu vines
that wrap the Sears Tower.

1413
01:41:49,600 --> 01:41:54,162
And when you look down,
you'll see tiny figures pounding corn,

1414
01:41:54,238 --> 01:41:57,799
laying strips of venison
in the empty car-pool lane

1415
01:41:57,875 --> 01:42:00,173
of some abandoned superhighway.

1416
01:42:13,625 --> 01:42:15,855
Feel better, champ.

1417
01:42:33,213 --> 01:42:35,010
<i>And then...</i>

1418
01:42:35,081 --> 01:42:36,639
Tyler?

1419
01:42:36,716 --> 01:42:38,809
<i>..Tyler was gone.</i>

1420
01:42:46,192 --> 01:42:48,218
<i>Was I asleep?</i>

1421
01:42:49,296 --> 01:42:51,320
<i>Had I slept?</i>

1422
01:42:51,464 --> 01:42:54,491
You are not a beautiful, unique snowflake...

1423
01:42:54,602 --> 01:42:57,036
<i>The house had become a living thing.</i>

1424
01:42:57,104 --> 01:43:01,735
<i>Wet inside from so many people
sweating and breathing.</i>

1425
01:43:02,243 --> 01:43:04,837
<i>So many people moving, the house moved.</i>

1426
01:43:07,715 --> 01:43:09,809
<i>Planet Tyler.</i>

1427
01:43:09,885 --> 01:43:11,944
<i>I had to hug the walls.</i>

1428
01:43:12,053 --> 01:43:15,146
<i>Trapped inside
this clockwork of space monkeys.</i>

1429
01:43:15,256 --> 01:43:19,057
You shouldn't be smoking in here!
You know how much ether is here!

1430
01:43:19,127 --> 01:43:21,652
<i>Cooking and working and sleeping in teams.</i>

1431
01:43:23,900 --> 01:43:25,958
Hang on a second.

1432
01:43:44,887 --> 01:43:47,583
It's under control, sir.

1433
01:43:50,059 --> 01:43:51,890
Where's Tyler?

1434
01:43:51,961 --> 01:43:54,954
Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem
is you do not...

1435
01:43:55,065 --> 01:43:56,998
Right... OK.

1436
01:43:59,402 --> 01:44:01,530
<i>I'm all alone.</i>

1437
01:44:01,705 --> 01:44:05,334
<i>My father dumped me. Tyler dumped me.</i>

1438
01:44:05,475 --> 01:44:07,706
<i>I am Jack's broken heart.</i>

1439
01:44:11,915 --> 01:44:15,716
<i>What comes next in Project Mayhem
only Tyler knows.</i>

1440
01:44:16,621 --> 01:44:19,817
<i>The second rule is you do not ask questions.</i>

1441
01:44:22,627 --> 01:44:25,323
Get the fuck away from me!
Get the fuck away!

1442
01:44:25,730 --> 01:44:27,789
Who are all these people?

1443
01:44:33,037 --> 01:44:35,335
The Paper Street Soap Company.

1444
01:44:36,908 --> 01:44:38,968
Can I come in?

1445
01:44:42,113 --> 01:44:44,172
He's not here.

1446
01:44:44,248 --> 01:44:46,513
What?

1447
01:44:47,553 --> 01:44:51,114
Tyler isn't here.

1448
01:44:51,190 --> 01:44:53,249
Tyler went away.

1449
01:44:53,726 --> 01:44:55,785
Tyler's gone.

1450
01:45:12,812 --> 01:45:14,541
Get some help!

1451
01:45:25,692 --> 01:45:30,596
Two gunshot wounds coming through!
Make some fucking room!

1452
01:45:30,665 --> 01:45:33,065
What happened? What happened?

1453
01:45:33,167 --> 01:45:36,034
We were on assignment. We were supposed
to kill two birds with one stone.

1454
01:45:37,304 --> 01:45:39,397
Destroy a piece of corporate art...

1455
01:45:39,473 --> 01:45:41,998
Operation Latte Thunder. Go!

1456
01:45:42,710 --> 01:45:45,874
..and trash a franchise coffee bar.

1457
01:45:52,287 --> 01:45:54,653
We had it all worked out, sir.

1458
01:46:02,831 --> 01:46:06,097
- It went smooth until...
- Police! Freeze!

1459
01:46:06,202 --> 01:46:08,931
- What?
- They shot Bob.

1460
01:46:10,439 --> 01:46:12,874
- They shot him in the head.
- Fucking pigs!

1461
01:46:18,247 --> 01:46:20,272
Oh, God!

1462
01:46:20,349 --> 01:46:23,648
- Those motherfuckers!
- You morons.

1463
01:46:23,720 --> 01:46:27,851
You're running around in ski masks
trying to blow things up?

1464
01:46:27,925 --> 01:46:30,620
What did you think was gonna happen?!

1465
01:46:32,361 --> 01:46:36,731
OK, quick! Get rid of the evidence.
We gotta get rid of this body!

1466
01:46:36,834 --> 01:46:39,701
- Bury him.
- What?

1467
01:46:39,770 --> 01:46:42,034
Take him to the garden and bury him.

1468
01:46:42,106 --> 01:46:44,973
- Come on, people, let's go!
- Get the fuck off!

1469
01:46:45,075 --> 01:46:48,306
Get away from him!
What are you talking about?

1470
01:46:48,378 --> 01:46:50,973
This isn't fucking evidence.
This is a person.

1471
01:46:51,082 --> 01:46:54,278
He's my friend
and you're not burying him in the garden!

1472
01:46:54,351 --> 01:46:57,344
He was killed serving Project Mayhem, sir.

1473
01:46:57,455 --> 01:46:59,480
- This is Bob.
- Sir, in...

1474
01:46:59,557 --> 01:47:01,684
In Project Mayhem, we have no names.

1475
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:03,750
Now, you listen to me.

1476
01:47:03,861 --> 01:47:08,356
This is a man and he has a name,
and it's Robert Paulsen, OK?

1477
01:47:08,466 --> 01:47:10,366
- Robert Paulsen.
- He's a man

1478
01:47:10,468 --> 01:47:13,302
and he's dead now because of us.
Do you understand that?

1479
01:47:13,973 --> 01:47:16,270
I understand.

1480
01:47:18,510 --> 01:47:21,878
In death, a member of Project Mayhem

1481
01:47:21,947 --> 01:47:24,006
has a name.

1482
01:47:24,150 --> 01:47:27,085
<i>His name is Robert Paulsen.</i>

1483
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:29,613
His name is Robert Paulsen.

1484
01:47:30,389 --> 01:47:33,085
His name... is Robert Paulsen.

1485
01:47:33,159 --> 01:47:36,993
His name is Robert Paulsen.

1486
01:47:37,096 --> 01:47:40,156
Come on, guys. Please. Stop it.

1487
01:47:40,232 --> 01:47:42,827
His name is Robert Paulsen.

1488
01:47:42,936 --> 01:47:45,996
Shut up! This is all over with!

1489
01:47:49,242 --> 01:47:51,767
Get the fuck out of here.

1490
01:48:20,474 --> 01:48:24,935
- Tyler?
- No, this is Detective Stern of the Arson Unit.

1491
01:48:25,013 --> 01:48:26,571
I need to see you...

1492
01:48:31,086 --> 01:48:35,147
<i>I went to all the cities
on Tyler's used ticket stubs, barhopping.</i>

1493
01:48:35,224 --> 01:48:39,992
<i>I didn't know how or why, but I could look
at 50 different bars, and somehow I just knew.</i>

1494
01:48:40,063 --> 01:48:44,624
<i>I'm looking for Tyler Durden.
It's very important that I talk to him.</i>

1495
01:48:44,766 --> 01:48:46,393
I wish I could help you,

1496
01:48:46,468 --> 01:48:48,801
sir.

1497
01:48:54,076 --> 01:48:56,170
<i>Every city I went to,</i>

1498
01:48:57,213 --> 01:48:59,613
<i>as soon as I set foot off the plane</i>

1499
01:49:00,216 --> 01:49:02,481
<i>I knew a Fight Club was close.</i>

1500
01:49:02,586 --> 01:49:04,246
Hey! Hey!

1501
01:49:05,321 --> 01:49:06,913
Taxi!

1502
01:49:07,023 --> 01:49:09,083
Look at my face. I'm a member.

1503
01:49:09,193 --> 01:49:11,718
Now, I just need to know if you've seen Tyler.

1504
01:49:11,829 --> 01:49:15,491
I'm not exposed to bespeak
any such information to you

1505
01:49:15,598 --> 01:49:20,298
nor would I, even if I had
said information at this juncture,... be able.

1506
01:49:21,005 --> 01:49:24,669
- You're a moron.
- I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

1507
01:49:26,044 --> 01:49:31,072
<i>Tyler had been busy...
setting up franchises all over the country.</i>

1508
01:49:33,852 --> 01:49:38,289
<i>Was I asleep? Had I slept?</i>

1509
01:49:38,356 --> 01:49:40,620
<i>Is Tyler my bad dream, or am I Tyler's?</i>

1510
01:49:42,027 --> 01:49:45,087
- We've just heard the stories.
- What kind of stories?

1511
01:49:45,163 --> 01:49:49,429
- Nobody knows what he looks like.
- He has plastic surgery every three years.

1512
01:49:49,501 --> 01:49:52,527
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

1513
01:49:52,637 --> 01:49:56,699
- Is it true about Fight Club in Miami?
- Is Mr Durden building an army?

1514
01:49:56,842 --> 01:49:59,833
<i>I was living in a state of perpetual déjà vu.</i>

1515
01:50:00,646 --> 01:50:02,705
<i>Everywhere I went,</i>

1516
01:50:02,848 --> 01:50:04,782
<i>I felt I'd already been there.</i>

1517
01:50:04,884 --> 01:50:07,786
<i>It was like following an invisible man.</i>

1518
01:50:08,889 --> 01:50:10,947
<i>The smell of dried blood,</i>

1519
01:50:11,057 --> 01:50:14,549
<i>dirty, bare footprints circling each other.</i>

1520
01:50:15,395 --> 01:50:18,592
<i>That aroma of old sweat, like fried chicken.</i>

1521
01:50:18,699 --> 01:50:22,259
<i>The feel of a floor still warm
from a fight the night before.</i>

1522
01:50:23,136 --> 01:50:26,071
<i>I was always just one step behind Tyler.</i>

1523
01:50:28,976 --> 01:50:32,104
His name is Robert Paulsen...

1524
01:50:36,717 --> 01:50:38,811
Welcome back, sir.

1525
01:50:39,787 --> 01:50:41,880
How have you been?

1526
01:50:41,956 --> 01:50:44,116
Do you know me?

1527
01:50:44,191 --> 01:50:46,592
Is this a test, sir?

1528
01:50:46,694 --> 01:50:48,559
No. This is not a test.

1529
01:50:48,629 --> 01:50:50,893
You were in here last Thursday.

1530
01:50:51,432 --> 01:50:53,731
Thursday?

1531
01:50:53,835 --> 01:50:57,794
You were standing where you are now,
asking how good security is.

1532
01:50:58,439 --> 01:51:00,533
It's tight as a drum, sir.

1533
01:51:03,212 --> 01:51:05,372
Who do you think I am?

1534
01:51:05,446 --> 01:51:08,007
Are you sure this isn't a test?

1535
01:51:08,117 --> 01:51:10,017
No, this is not a test.

1536
01:51:10,119 --> 01:51:12,178
You're Mr Durden.

1537
01:51:13,522 --> 01:51:16,184
You're the one who gave me this.

1538
01:51:16,258 --> 01:51:20,456
<i>Please return your seat backs
to their full upright and locked position.</i>

1539
01:51:31,941 --> 01:51:34,000
<i>- Yeah?
- Marla, it's me.</i>

1540
01:51:34,077 --> 01:51:36,046
<i>- Have we ever done it?
- Done what?</i>

1541
01:51:36,147 --> 01:51:37,478
Had sex?

1542
01:51:37,581 --> 01:51:39,741
What kind of stupid question is that?

1543
01:51:39,849 --> 01:51:42,215
Stupid because it's yes
or because it's no?

1544
01:51:42,285 --> 01:51:44,880
<i>- Is this a trick?
- No. I need to know...</i>

1545
01:51:44,989 --> 01:51:48,856
You wanna know if I think
we were just having sex or making love?

1546
01:51:48,958 --> 01:51:52,360
<i>- We did make love?
- Is that what you're calling it?</i>

1547
01:51:52,430 --> 01:51:55,263
Just answer the question!
Did we do it or not?!

1548
01:51:55,366 --> 01:51:58,268
You fuck me, then snub me.
You love me, you hate me.

1549
01:51:58,370 --> 01:52:01,236
You're sensitive,
then you turn into an asshole.

1550
01:52:01,305 --> 01:52:04,001
Does that describe our relationship, Tyler?

1551
01:52:04,075 --> 01:52:06,169
<i>We just lost cabin pressure.</i>

1552
01:52:06,244 --> 01:52:07,711
What did you just say?

1553
01:52:07,813 --> 01:52:10,179
- What is wrong with you?
- Say my name!

1554
01:52:10,248 --> 01:52:13,911
Tyler Durden!
You fucking freak! What's going on?

1555
01:52:14,019 --> 01:52:16,078
- I'm coming over!
- I'm not there!

1556
01:52:16,188 --> 01:52:18,986
You broke your promise.

1557
01:52:19,057 --> 01:52:21,026
Jesus, Tyler.

1558
01:52:21,094 --> 01:52:24,529
- You fucking talked to her about me.
- What the fuck is going on?

1559
01:52:24,629 --> 01:52:28,088
I asked you for one thing. One simple thing.

1560
01:52:28,201 --> 01:52:30,499
Why do people think that I'm you?

1561
01:52:31,070 --> 01:52:33,128
Answer me!

1562
01:52:35,508 --> 01:52:37,339
Sit.

1563
01:52:40,146 --> 01:52:42,843
Answer me. Why do people think I'm you?

1564
01:52:42,950 --> 01:52:45,110
I think you know.

1565
01:52:45,251 --> 01:52:47,811
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

1566
01:52:47,920 --> 01:52:50,651
Why would anyone
possibly confuse you with me?

1567
01:52:50,724 --> 01:52:53,522
I... I don't know.

1568
01:52:58,298 --> 01:53:01,165
- You got it.
- No.

1569
01:53:01,268 --> 01:53:03,361
- Do not fuck with us!
- Say it.

1570
01:53:04,739 --> 01:53:06,763
Because...

1571
01:53:08,142 --> 01:53:09,302
Say it!

1572
01:53:10,978 --> 01:53:13,038
Because we're the same person.

1573
01:53:13,114 --> 01:53:15,241
That's right.

1574
01:53:15,316 --> 01:53:17,476
<i>We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap.</i>

1575
01:53:17,551 --> 01:53:21,283
- I don't understand this.
- You wanted a way to change your life.

1576
01:53:21,356 --> 01:53:23,449
You could not do this on your own.

1577
01:53:23,525 --> 01:53:25,584
All the ways you wish you could be,

1578
01:53:25,693 --> 01:53:27,558
that's me.

1579
01:53:27,662 --> 01:53:30,790
I look like you wanna look,
I fuck like you wanna fuck.

1580
01:53:30,899 --> 01:53:33,265
I am smart, capable and, most importantly,

1581
01:53:33,334 --> 01:53:36,099
I'm free in all the ways that you are not.

1582
01:53:36,172 --> 01:53:37,161
Oh, no.

1583
01:53:37,273 --> 01:53:40,173
- Tyler's not here. Tyler went away.
- What?

1584
01:53:40,275 --> 01:53:42,574
This isn't possible. This is crazy.

1585
01:53:42,678 --> 01:53:44,703
People do it every day.

1586
01:53:44,780 --> 01:53:48,342
They talk to themselves.
They see themselves as they'd like to be.

1587
01:53:48,418 --> 01:53:51,682
They don't have the courage you have
to just run with it.

1588
01:53:55,492 --> 01:53:58,825
You still wrestle with it,
so sometimes you're still you.

1589
01:53:58,962 --> 01:54:03,626
- We should do this again sometime.
- At times, you imagine you're watching me.

1590
01:54:03,733 --> 01:54:06,224
If this is your first time, you have to fight.

1591
01:54:06,336 --> 01:54:10,706
Little by little,
you're just letting yourself become

1592
01:54:11,541 --> 01:54:13,441
Tyler Durden.

1593
01:54:13,543 --> 01:54:16,341
You are not yourjob
or how much money you have!

1594
01:54:16,413 --> 01:54:18,814
- No. You have a house.
- Rented in your name.

1595
01:54:18,916 --> 01:54:22,544
- You have jobs, a life.
- You work nights because you can't sleep.

1596
01:54:22,619 --> 01:54:24,416
Or you stay up and make soap.

1597
01:54:24,521 --> 01:54:29,459
- You're fucking Marla, Tyler.
- Technically, you are. It's all the same to her.

1598
01:54:31,195 --> 01:54:33,221
Oh, my God.

1599
01:54:34,232 --> 01:54:36,325
Now you see our dilemma.

1600
01:54:36,400 --> 01:54:38,664
She knows too much.

1601
01:54:38,769 --> 01:54:43,867
I think we're gonna have to talk about
how this might compromise our goals.

1602
01:54:44,009 --> 01:54:46,135
What... What are you saying?

1603
01:54:47,079 --> 01:54:51,345
This is bullshit. This is bullshit,
I'm not listening to this!

1604
01:54:51,416 --> 01:54:54,078
- You are insane!
- No. You're insane.

1605
01:54:54,187 --> 01:54:56,882
We simply do not have time for this crap.

1606
01:54:58,390 --> 01:55:00,585
<i>It's called a changeover.</i>

1607
01:55:00,659 --> 01:55:02,753
<i>The movie goes on</i>

1608
01:55:02,829 --> 01:55:05,957
<i>and nobody in the audience has any idea.</i>

1609
01:55:18,911 --> 01:55:22,608
- Sir! Are you checking out?
- Yeah. Bill me.

1610
01:55:22,682 --> 01:55:25,117
Can you initial this list of phone calls?

1611
01:55:29,522 --> 01:55:33,584
- When were these made?
- Between 2.00 and 3.30 this morning.

1612
01:55:39,433 --> 01:55:43,529
<i>Have I been going to bed earlier every night?
Have I been sleeping later?</i>

1613
01:55:43,637 --> 01:55:48,507
<i>Have I been Tyler longer and longer?</i>

1614
01:55:51,011 --> 01:55:53,446
Is anybody here?

1615
01:55:56,117 --> 01:55:58,210
<i>Déjà vu all over again.</i>

1616
01:55:59,854 --> 01:56:02,345
With enough soap,
one could blow up anything.

1617
01:56:04,693 --> 01:56:06,752
Oh, my God.

1618
01:56:10,666 --> 01:56:13,031
<i>- 1888.
- Who am I calling?</i>

1619
01:56:13,468 --> 01:56:17,132
<i>1888 Franklin. This is maintenance. Hello?</i>

1620
01:56:18,307 --> 01:56:19,899
<i>Hello?</i>

1621
01:56:19,975 --> 01:56:22,102
1888 Franklin Street?

1622
01:56:22,178 --> 01:56:24,271
<i>Yes. Can I help you?</i>

1623
01:56:26,716 --> 01:56:29,310
<i>- Hello?
- Yeah, yeah.</i>

1624
01:56:29,385 --> 01:56:31,911
I need to talk to your supervisor right away.

1625
01:56:31,988 --> 01:56:34,114
<i>- Speaking.
- OK, listen to me.</i>

1626
01:56:34,190 --> 01:56:37,354
Something terrible
is about to happen to your building.

1627
01:56:37,461 --> 01:56:39,520
<i>It's under control, sir.</i>

1628
01:56:39,963 --> 01:56:43,524
<i>- Excuse me?
- Don't worry about us, sir. We're solid.</i>

1629
01:56:47,771 --> 01:56:49,136
<i>2160.</i>

1630
01:56:56,747 --> 01:56:59,273
Marla! Marla! Hey, wait!

1631
01:57:00,952 --> 01:57:03,750
Wait! I gotta talk to you! Marla! Marla!

1632
01:57:03,821 --> 01:57:07,985
Your bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom!
They almost broke my arm!

1633
01:57:08,126 --> 01:57:10,822
They were burning their fingertips with lye.

1634
01:57:10,928 --> 01:57:14,888
This needs a tremendous act of faith
on your part, but hear me out.

1635
01:57:14,967 --> 01:57:18,925
- Here comes an avalanche of bullshit.
- A little more faith than that.

1636
01:57:22,174 --> 01:57:24,734
I don't wanna hear
anything you have to say.

1637
01:57:24,810 --> 01:57:26,937
You have every right to be...

1638
01:57:27,546 --> 01:57:29,411
I'll just have a coffee, thanks.

1639
01:57:29,515 --> 01:57:32,450
Sir. Anything you order is free of charge, sir.

1640
01:57:32,551 --> 01:57:34,576
Why is it free of charge?

1641
01:57:34,653 --> 01:57:36,713
- Don't ask.
- Whatever.

1642
01:57:36,790 --> 01:57:42,318
I'll have the clam chowder, fried chicken
and baked potato and a chocolate chiffon pie.

1643
01:57:42,394 --> 01:57:44,454
Clean food, please.

1644
01:57:44,564 --> 01:57:47,590
In that case,
may I advise against the clam chowder.

1645
01:57:47,667 --> 01:57:49,760
No clam chowder. Thank you.

1646
01:57:51,237 --> 01:57:53,467
You got about 30 seconds.

1647
01:57:56,176 --> 01:57:58,668
I know I've been acting very strange, OK?

1648
01:57:58,779 --> 01:58:02,214
- I know it seems there's two sides to me...
- Two sides?

1649
01:58:02,282 --> 01:58:07,346
- You're Dr Jekyll and Mr Jackass.
- I know. But I realized something important.

1650
01:58:07,421 --> 01:58:11,482
- What?
- The nature of our relationship wasn't clear

1651
01:58:11,592 --> 01:58:13,958
to me for reasons I won't go into.

1652
01:58:14,028 --> 01:58:16,622
- I know I haven't treated you well.
- Whatever.

1653
01:58:16,697 --> 01:58:19,427
No, no. Fifteen seconds, please!

1654
01:58:19,500 --> 01:58:21,799
Fifteen seconds,
don't open your mouth.

1655
01:58:21,870 --> 01:58:23,962
I'm trying to tell you I'm sorry.

1656
01:58:24,038 --> 01:58:28,373
What I've come to realize
is that I really like you, Marla.

1657
01:58:28,443 --> 01:58:30,570
You do?

1658
01:58:30,645 --> 01:58:32,510
I really do.

1659
01:58:32,614 --> 01:58:36,914
I care about you and I don't want anything
bad to happen to you because of me.

1660
01:58:37,018 --> 01:58:39,782
Marla, your life is in danger.

1661
01:58:39,855 --> 01:58:41,789
What?

1662
01:58:41,857 --> 01:58:45,588
You need to leave town for a while.
Get out of any major city.

1663
01:58:45,660 --> 01:58:48,458
- Just go camping...
- You're an insane person.

1664
01:58:48,530 --> 01:58:51,989
- No. I've involved you in something terrible.
- No. Shut up!

1665
01:58:52,068 --> 01:58:54,628
- You're not safe.
- Shut up!

1666
01:58:56,439 --> 01:59:00,876
- Listen, I tried, Tyler. I really tried.
- I know you did.

1667
01:59:00,943 --> 01:59:04,004
There are things about you I like.
You're smart, funny.

1668
01:59:04,081 --> 01:59:06,049
You're spectacular in bed.

1669
01:59:06,116 --> 01:59:07,548
But

1670
01:59:07,650 --> 01:59:09,709
you're intolerable.

1671
01:59:09,819 --> 01:59:12,311
You have very serious emotional problems.

1672
01:59:12,422 --> 01:59:16,358
Deep-seated problems
for which you should seek professional help.

1673
01:59:16,460 --> 01:59:20,419
- I know, and I'm sorry.
- You're sorry, I'm sorry. Everyone's sorry.

1674
01:59:21,565 --> 01:59:23,658
I can't do this any more.

1675
01:59:23,734 --> 01:59:25,827
I can't.

1676
01:59:25,903 --> 01:59:27,963
And I won't.

1677
01:59:28,072 --> 01:59:30,096
I'm gone.

1678
01:59:30,173 --> 01:59:32,869
You can't leave, Marla! You're not safe!

1679
01:59:35,713 --> 01:59:38,375
- Marla, you don't understand!
- Leave me alone!

1680
01:59:38,483 --> 01:59:40,974
- Marla, I am trying to protect you!
- Let go!

1681
01:59:41,085 --> 01:59:44,077
- I don't ever wanna see you again!
- That's fine...

1682
01:59:44,155 --> 01:59:46,282
Here, wait right here!

1683
01:59:50,162 --> 01:59:52,721
Hold it right there! Shut up!

1684
01:59:52,797 --> 01:59:54,924
Take this money and get on this bus.

1685
01:59:54,999 --> 01:59:57,161
I promise I won't bother you again.

1686
01:59:57,303 --> 01:59:58,736
Shut up!

1687
01:59:58,804 --> 02:00:02,001
Please get on the bus. Please get on the bus.

1688
02:00:03,175 --> 02:00:05,302
Why are you doing this?

1689
02:00:05,377 --> 02:00:09,473
They think you're a threat.
I can't explain it now, just trust me!

1690
02:00:09,548 --> 02:00:13,917
- If I know where you are, you won't be safe.
- I'll keep this, it's asshole tax.

1691
02:00:13,986 --> 02:00:18,390
- Fine. Remember, stay out of major cities.
- Tyler.

1692
02:00:19,926 --> 02:00:22,759
You're the worst thing
that ever happened to me.

1693
02:00:37,777 --> 02:00:40,440
Hello. I need you to arrest me.

1694
02:00:40,548 --> 02:00:43,312
I am the leader of a terrorist organization

1695
02:00:43,384 --> 02:00:48,344
responsible for numerous acts
of vandalism and assault all over this city.

1696
02:00:48,422 --> 02:00:52,324
In the metropolitan area,
we had probably 200 members.

1697
02:00:52,393 --> 02:00:56,194
Chapters have sprung up
in five or six other major cities already.

1698
02:00:56,365 --> 02:00:59,390
This is a tightly-regimented organization

1699
02:00:59,467 --> 02:01:05,065
with many cells capable of operating
independent of central leadership.

1700
02:01:05,173 --> 02:01:09,041
Go to the house, OK? 1537 Paper Street.

1701
02:01:09,144 --> 02:01:11,044
That's our headquarters.

1702
02:01:11,146 --> 02:01:13,740
In the back, buried in the garden,

1703
02:01:13,815 --> 02:01:16,842
you'll find the body of Robert Paulsen.

1704
02:01:16,953 --> 02:01:20,251
In the basement,
you're gonna find some bathtubs

1705
02:01:20,389 --> 02:01:25,692
that have been used very recently
to make large quantities of nitroglycerin.

1706
02:01:25,795 --> 02:01:27,820
I believe the plan is to blow up

1707
02:01:27,897 --> 02:01:30,991
the headquarters
of these credit card companies

1708
02:01:31,067 --> 02:01:33,160
and the TRW building.

1709
02:01:34,103 --> 02:01:37,470
Why these buildings?
Why credit card companies?

1710
02:01:37,573 --> 02:01:41,168
If you erase the debt record,
then we all go back to zero.

1711
02:01:42,011 --> 02:01:44,070
You'll create total chaos.

1712
02:01:45,683 --> 02:01:48,914
Keep him talking. I need to make a phone
call.

1713
02:01:59,496 --> 02:02:01,727
I really admire what you're doing.

1714
02:02:02,200 --> 02:02:04,258
What?

1715
02:02:04,401 --> 02:02:06,426
You're a brave man to order this.

1716
02:02:06,503 --> 02:02:08,267
You're a genius, sir.

1717
02:02:08,406 --> 02:02:13,105
You said if anyone ever interferes
with Project Mayhem, even you,

1718
02:02:13,211 --> 02:02:15,543
we gotta get his balls.

1719
02:02:16,948 --> 02:02:20,111
- Don't fight.
- It's a powerful gesture, Mr Durden.

1720
02:02:20,218 --> 02:02:23,245
- It will set an example.
- You're making a big mistake!

1721
02:02:23,322 --> 02:02:26,154
- You said you'd say that.
- I'm not Tyler Durden!

1722
02:02:26,257 --> 02:02:30,126
- You told us you'd say that too.
- All right. I am Tyler Durden.

1723
02:02:30,229 --> 02:02:32,925
Listen to me. I'm giving you a direct order.

1724
02:02:33,032 --> 02:02:37,162
- We're aborting this mission now.
- You said you would definitely say that.

1725
02:02:43,309 --> 02:02:46,871
Are you fucking out of your minds?
You're police officers!

1726
02:02:47,713 --> 02:02:49,772
Is somebody timing this?

1727
02:02:49,949 --> 02:02:52,919
Keep your mouth shut.

1728
02:02:52,986 --> 02:02:55,079
Shit!

1729
02:02:57,724 --> 02:03:00,522
Some of this information checks out.

1730
02:03:00,594 --> 02:03:03,893
- Let's go to that house on Paper Street.
- Be right there.

1731
02:03:04,598 --> 02:03:06,362
Hey, wait!

1732
02:03:07,068 --> 02:03:09,592
- I got him.
- Sir, we have to do this.

1733
02:03:09,703 --> 02:03:12,171
- Stop fighting!
- Where's the rubber band?

1734
02:03:12,272 --> 02:03:14,764
Get away from me! Drop that fucking knife!

1735
02:03:18,312 --> 02:03:21,748
Back up. Face down on the floor right now!

1736
02:03:22,984 --> 02:03:25,009
Get down on the floor!

1737
02:03:29,792 --> 02:03:32,692
The first person
that comes out of this door

1738
02:03:32,760 --> 02:03:34,728
gets a lead salad! Understand?

1739
02:03:59,055 --> 02:04:01,649
Get away! Stay away!

1740
02:04:14,605 --> 02:04:16,663
<i>I ran.</i>

1741
02:04:17,207 --> 02:04:21,372
<i>I ran until my muscles burned
and my veins pumped battery acid.</i>

1742
02:04:24,014 --> 02:04:26,072
<i>Then I ran some more.</i>

1743
02:05:06,792 --> 02:05:09,090
What the fuck are you doing?

1744
02:05:09,195 --> 02:05:12,130
Running around in your underpants!
You look crazy!

1745
02:05:12,231 --> 02:05:15,325
No. I'm onto you.
I know what's going on here.

1746
02:05:15,434 --> 02:05:20,338
Come on, then. I got us a great place
to watch from. It'll be like pay-per-view.

1747
02:06:08,323 --> 02:06:10,986
- Oh, Christ.
- Now what are you doing?

1748
02:06:11,093 --> 02:06:14,460
- I'm stopping this.
- Why?

1749
02:06:14,530 --> 02:06:17,931
- The greatest thing you've ever done.
- I can't let this happen.

1750
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:21,265
There are 10 other bombs
in 10 other buildings.

1751
02:06:21,337 --> 02:06:23,703
Since when is Project Mayhem
about murder?

1752
02:06:23,772 --> 02:06:25,764
The buildings are empty.

1753
02:06:25,875 --> 02:06:28,707
We're not killing anyone.
We're setting 'em free!

1754
02:06:28,777 --> 02:06:31,541
Bob is dead. They shot him in the head.

1755
02:06:31,680 --> 02:06:35,014
You wanna make an omelette,
you gotta break some eggs.

1756
02:06:35,118 --> 02:06:38,712
No. I'm not listening to you.
You're not even there.

1757
02:06:44,761 --> 02:06:49,130
I wouldn't do that.
Not unless you knew which wires were what.

1758
02:06:49,199 --> 02:06:50,928
If you know, I know.

1759
02:06:56,540 --> 02:07:00,908
<i>Or maybe I knew you'd know, so I spent
all day thinking about the wrong ones.</i>

1760
02:07:09,421 --> 02:07:10,512
You think?

1761
02:07:12,523 --> 02:07:14,616
Oh, heavens, no. Not the green one.

1762
02:07:15,459 --> 02:07:18,452
Pull any one but the green one.

1763
02:07:23,200 --> 02:07:25,829
I asked you not to do that!

1764
02:07:27,672 --> 02:07:29,230
Fuck!

1765
02:07:30,175 --> 02:07:32,268
Tyler, get away from the van.

1766
02:07:34,479 --> 02:07:37,880
Tyler, I'm not kidding!
Get away from the van!

1767
02:07:37,983 --> 02:07:39,349
Goddamn it!

1768
02:07:45,691 --> 02:07:47,056
OK.

1769
02:07:47,160 --> 02:07:50,493
You are now firing a gun
at your imaginary friend

1770
02:07:50,596 --> 02:07:53,191
near 400 gallons of nitroglycerin!

1771
02:07:55,401 --> 02:07:57,164
Cool it, Tyler!

1772
02:08:10,384 --> 02:08:12,443
Come on!

1773
02:08:12,519 --> 02:08:14,578
Don't go!

1774
02:08:52,161 --> 02:08:53,355
What?!

1775
02:09:38,843 --> 02:09:39,537
Three minutes.

1776
02:09:40,478 --> 02:09:42,776
This is it.

1777
02:09:42,880 --> 02:09:44,905
The beginning.

1778
02:09:44,982 --> 02:09:46,950
Ground zero.

1779
02:09:47,018 --> 02:09:49,316
<i>I think this is about where we came in.</i>

1780
02:09:49,387 --> 02:09:51,879
Do you have a speech for the occasion?

1781
02:09:51,957 --> 02:09:54,982
I'm sorry?

1782
02:09:55,092 --> 02:09:57,151
I still can't think of anything.

1783
02:09:59,198 --> 02:10:01,291
Flashback humor.

1784
02:10:06,371 --> 02:10:08,396
It's getting exciting now.

1785
02:10:09,975 --> 02:10:11,772
Two and a half.

1786
02:10:11,843 --> 02:10:14,404
Think of everything we've accomplished.

1787
02:10:14,514 --> 02:10:19,314
Out these windows, we will view
the collapse of financial history.

1788
02:10:19,384 --> 02:10:23,116
One step closer to economic equilibrium.

1789
02:10:36,670 --> 02:10:39,069
Why is she here?

1790
02:10:39,172 --> 02:10:41,072
Tying up loose ends.

1791
02:10:41,174 --> 02:10:44,235
Put me down, you baldheaded fuck!

1792
02:10:44,345 --> 02:10:47,439
- I beg you, please don't do this.
- I'm not doing this.

1793
02:10:47,548 --> 02:10:51,006
<i>- We are doing this. This is what we want.
- No.</i>

1794
02:10:51,085 --> 02:10:55,818
- I don't want this.
- Right. Except you is meaningless now.

1795
02:10:55,889 --> 02:10:59,883
- We have to forget about you.
- You're a voice in my head.

1796
02:10:59,995 --> 02:11:02,053
You're a voice in mine!

1797
02:11:02,162 --> 02:11:04,996
- Why can't I get rid of you?
- You need me.

1798
02:11:05,066 --> 02:11:07,159
No. I don't. I really don't any more.

1799
02:11:07,235 --> 02:11:11,502
You created me. I didn't create some
loser alter ego to make me feel better.

1800
02:11:11,607 --> 02:11:15,565
- Take some responsibility.
- I do. I am responsible for all of it

1801
02:11:15,677 --> 02:11:17,406
and I accept that.

1802
02:11:17,479 --> 02:11:21,507
So, please, I'm begging you,
please call this off.

1803
02:11:23,518 --> 02:11:25,713
Have I ever let us down?

1804
02:11:27,189 --> 02:11:29,487
How far have you come because of me?!

1805
02:11:35,398 --> 02:11:37,457
I will bring us through this.

1806
02:11:37,533 --> 02:11:41,334
As always, I will carry you
kicking and screaming

1807
02:11:41,438 --> 02:11:43,872
and in the end you will thank me.

1808
02:11:44,341 --> 02:11:46,865
Tyler. Tyler.

1809
02:11:46,942 --> 02:11:50,470
I'm grateful to you.
For everything that you've done for me.

1810
02:11:50,547 --> 02:11:53,243
But this is too much. I don't want this.

1811
02:11:53,317 --> 02:11:58,619
What do you want? Your shitjob back?
Fucking condo world, watching sitcoms?

1812
02:11:58,689 --> 02:12:00,748
Fuck you! I won't do it.

1813
02:12:01,625 --> 02:12:05,460
- This can't be happening.
- It's already done, so shut up!

1814
02:12:05,530 --> 02:12:07,156
60 seconds till CRI.

1815
02:12:07,698 --> 02:12:09,757
No.

1816
02:12:11,669 --> 02:12:14,467
I can figure this out. This isn't even real.

1817
02:12:14,539 --> 02:12:18,236
You're not real, that gun...
That gun isn't even in your hand.

1818
02:12:19,711 --> 02:12:21,770
The gun's in my hand.

1819
02:12:26,785 --> 02:12:29,275
Good for you. It doesn't change a thing.

1820
02:12:38,163 --> 02:12:40,791
Why do you wanna put a gun to your head?

1821
02:12:40,933 --> 02:12:42,992
Not my head, Tyler.

1822
02:12:43,569 --> 02:12:45,594
Our head.

1823
02:12:47,140 --> 02:12:49,199
Interesting.

1824
02:12:52,211 --> 02:12:54,874
Where are you going with this, Ikea boy?

1825
02:13:01,353 --> 02:13:04,346
Hey. It's you and me.

1826
02:13:07,093 --> 02:13:09,153
Friends?

1827
02:13:09,997 --> 02:13:12,090
Tyler,

1828
02:13:15,502 --> 02:13:17,835
I want you to really listen to me.

1829
02:13:17,972 --> 02:13:20,406
OK.

1830
02:13:20,508 --> 02:13:22,567
My eyes are open.

1831
02:13:41,329 --> 02:13:43,354
What's that smell?

1832
02:14:02,985 --> 02:14:05,977
- Where is everybody?
- Oh, no. What's going on?

1833
02:14:06,622 --> 02:14:08,214
Mr Durden!

1834
02:14:09,292 --> 02:14:11,157
Oh, my God!

1835
02:14:16,500 --> 02:14:19,696
Are you... Are you all right, sir?

1836
02:14:19,802 --> 02:14:23,762
- Oh, yeah, I'm OK.
- You look terrible, sir. What happened?

1837
02:14:23,841 --> 02:14:27,834
- Nothing, it's no problem.
- No, no, no, sir. He's not kidding.

1838
02:14:27,911 --> 02:14:30,675
- You look awful. You need assistance.
- I'm fine.

1839
02:14:30,814 --> 02:14:34,409
Look, I'm fine... Everything's fine.

1840
02:14:36,687 --> 02:14:38,918
Stop it!

1841
02:14:39,057 --> 02:14:42,184
- Let her go.
- Christ Almighty!

1842
02:14:42,259 --> 02:14:44,056
You!

1843
02:14:44,127 --> 02:14:46,221
Hi, Marla.

1844
02:14:46,698 --> 02:14:51,532
- Leave her with me. Meet me downstairs.
- Are you sure?

1845
02:14:51,636 --> 02:14:53,695
Yes, I'm sure.

1846
02:14:54,806 --> 02:14:58,902
You fucker! What kind of sick
fucking game are you playing at?!

1847
02:14:59,044 --> 02:15:01,706
Putting me on a... Oh, my God, your face!

1848
02:15:01,814 --> 02:15:03,303
Yeah, I know.

1849
02:15:08,087 --> 02:15:09,952
What happened?

1850
02:15:10,089 --> 02:15:12,216
- Don't ask.
- You're shot.

1851
02:15:12,291 --> 02:15:14,350
- Yes, I'm shot.
- Oh, my God.

1852
02:15:15,294 --> 02:15:18,320
- I can't believe he's standing.
- One tough motherfucker.

1853
02:15:22,135 --> 02:15:23,966
Who did this?

1854
02:15:24,103 --> 02:15:26,571
I did, actually.

1855
02:15:26,672 --> 02:15:28,732
Find some gauze.

1856
02:15:30,110 --> 02:15:32,135
You shot yourself?

02:15:32,245 --> 02:15:34,873
Yes, but it's OK. Marla, look at me.

1858
02:15:34,948 --> 02:15:37,246

02:15:54,101 --> 02:15:57,969
