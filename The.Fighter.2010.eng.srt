Proudly Presents

00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:47,444
<i>- You bringing Micky in?
- Yeah, he's gonna come.</i>

3
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,309
<i>He should be here as well.</i>

4
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:51,280
<i>You think he'll answer questions?</i>

5
00:00:51,417 --> 00:00:53,408
<i>They said it was
gonna be both of us here.</i>

6
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:58,488
- Am I looking right in the camera here?
- Just look at me, right here.

7
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:02,185
All right. You don't want me to look
in the camera with the...

8
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:04,091
- Right over here.
...interviews?

9
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:08,966
<i>I started boxing
when I was 12 years old,</i>

10
00:01:09,102 --> 00:01:11,468
<i>and I'd lie and say I was 18,
or whatever it was.</i>

11
00:01:11,604 --> 00:01:13,572
<i>You know, I had a different
name and everything.</i>

12
00:01:13,706 --> 00:01:14,900
<i>I mean, I don't know how many fights...</i>

13
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:18,442
<i>I'd done a hundred, more than that,
before I turned professional.</i>

14
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:21,479
- Go ahead and sit right there.
- Why we doing this?

15
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:23,741
- I don't wanna do this.
- You want to start again?

16
00:01:23,883 --> 00:01:27,580
<i>This is my younger brother.
I taught him everything he knows.</i>

17
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,620
I'm still his trainer.
You know, we got different styles.

18
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:33,783
I'm fuckin' squirrelly as fuck.
I'm like... I'm not even there.

19
00:01:33,926 --> 00:01:35,393
You know, that's what Sugar Ray said.

20
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:37,928
I was the most tricky fighter
he'd ever come across.

21
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:41,357
<i>In '78, I fought Sugar Ray Leonard.</i>

22
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:43,765
<i>I went toe-to-toe with him.
He couldn't get to me.</i>

23
00:01:43,903 --> 00:01:45,700
<i>He couldn't get to me.</i>

24
00:01:45,838 --> 00:01:48,500
<i>They called me the pride...
the pride of Lowell.</i>

25
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:51,269
<i>Everybody still talks about it,
especially my brother.</i>

26
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:53,242
<i>His whole life he wanted
to do what I did, you know?</i>

27
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:56,212
<i>But we're very different fighters.</i>

28
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:58,078
Micky's, you know,
he's a heavy hitter.

29
00:01:58,217 --> 00:02:00,481
He's got... a thunderous,

30
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,646
I'm telling you,
thunderous left punch.

31
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,122
Micky, he gets you
and he takes a punishment,

32
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:08,625
I don't know why he does it,
till you're right fuckin' in there.

33
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:10,820
He likes getting on the inside,
I stay on the outside.

34
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,791
Come on.

35
00:02:43,362 --> 00:02:44,693
Dicky.

36
00:02:49,635 --> 00:02:51,899
Would you come on?

37
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:54,871
Will you stop?
You gotta help me finish this.

38
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:58,710
Come on!

39
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,710
- And predictable as ever.
- All right.

40
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,041
- You don't need to be Columbo
- Here you go.

41
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:04,445
To see where this fight is headed.

42
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:08,611
Bam! Over right hand
puts Micky Ward down!

43
00:03:08,754 --> 00:03:12,087
HBO's making a movie
on me and my comeback!

44
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:17,857
And my brother is gonna beat
Saoul Mamby in Atlantic City next week!

45
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:21,763
The pride of Lowell is back!

46
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:25,701
Quacka!
Who wants some?!

47
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:27,931
Who wants some?!

48
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:50,529
Hey! I want a cut.

49
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,534
Are you good?
You guys having a good day?

50
00:03:57,703 --> 00:03:59,500
How are ya?

51
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:05,207
Come on! What you got?
What you got going on?

52
00:04:05,344 --> 00:04:08,177
Lou! Hey, Lou!

53
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:10,509
- How are you guys?
- Dicky.

54
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:16,185
Making my comeback.

55
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,284
Hey, naughty, naughty.
What's going on here?

56
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:25,928
Hey, Dicky, Micky!
Take my picture.

57
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:27,327
- Take a picture?
- Yeah.

58
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:38,339
- Hey!
- Hey, Louie!

59
00:04:38,477 --> 00:04:40,536
HBO's making a movie on me!

60
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,080
What's going on? Hey, beautiful.

61
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:51,051
Did you tap that?

62
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,784
I can't remember. I got CRS:
I Can't Remember Shit!

63
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:57,828
Hey, Jerry Garcia!

64
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,159
Are you nuts?

65
00:05:00,299 --> 00:05:03,029
How'd you get here?
You drive around?

66
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:06,468
Hey, Ray. Ray. I love you, Ray.

67
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:08,335
You're doing well.

68
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:23,012
You're walking. Get on it.

69
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:35,933
- We make a mistake?
- Nah, I mean, he'll be here.

70
00:05:36,068 --> 00:05:38,502
You know, like I said,
sometimes he goes on his own schedule

71
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:41,198
but when he gets here, we work hard.
You know, nobody pushes me harder.

72
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,537
He's supposed to be
training you right now, right?

73
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:47,407
Why don't you just go talk to them,
my sisters? They'll talk your ear off.

74
00:05:47,546 --> 00:05:48,638
You gotta pay them to shut up.

75
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:50,874
He can tell you
how Dicky was helping him.

76
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,247
Yeah, come on, Micky.

77
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:57,789
- O'Keefe!
- Hey, we don't know where Dicky is.

78
00:05:57,923 --> 00:05:59,914
You know where he is.

79
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:20,710
What's that Keystone Kop
doing in there? Where's Dicky? Girls?

80
00:06:20,846 --> 00:06:22,814
- I don't know.
- Did you see him, your brother?

81
00:06:22,948 --> 00:06:24,939
- Not this morning?
- Look at Ma!

82
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:28,144
All dressed up for the movie, huh?

83
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:30,812
- Wow!
- Get outta the ring, O'Keefe.

84
00:06:30,956 --> 00:06:32,856
My Dicky should be doing that, huh?

85
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:35,256
Your Dicky ain't here, Alice.

86
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:38,192
Micky's got an important fight
coming up and he's not training.

87
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:41,026
Don't. Just forget about him.

88
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:43,567
He's number two man.
He's not part of this, all right?

89
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:45,466
- He's not being handled right.
- You get me coming in all right?

90
00:06:45,604 --> 00:06:46,832
You want me to do that again?

91
00:06:46,972 --> 00:06:49,497
Get out of the ring, O'Keefe.
Dicky's the trainer.

92
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:52,634
- I'm doing a favor, Alice.
- I will show you over here

93
00:06:52,778 --> 00:06:56,077
these scrapbooks
I've been collecting for years.

94
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:58,911
Micky used to follow
his big brother everywhere.

95
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:00,609
Taught ya everything, didn't he, honey?

96
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:05,087
In '78, we got the offer
to fight Sugar Ray Leonard.

97
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:07,283
Oh, my God, it was...
Have you seen that video?

98
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:09,587
Oh, you're from HBO.
You gotta see it again. Come on.

99
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:11,162
Art, Art, where's the video at?

100
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:21,171
<i>Tonight, my son is gonna surprise
everybody and beat Sugar Ray Leonard.</i>

101
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:23,502
<i>Believe me, I know it.</i>

102
00:07:25,544 --> 00:07:27,535
<i>Sugar Ray might have
some trouble tonight.</i>

103
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,979
<i>That's a good possibility.
He comes in here against a good boxer,</i>

104
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:34,382
<i>a young man who can punch,
and I would like to say at this time</i>

105
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,784
<i>that physically
they're just about equal.</i>

106
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:58,571
<i>Leonard is down.
Let's see if that's a knockdown.</i>

107
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,676
<i>This is unbelievable.</i>

108
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,913
<i>Eklund just walked over him!</i>

109
00:08:06,051 --> 00:08:09,043
<i>Nobody seems
to know what's happening!</i>

110
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:18,093
Dicky did it.
Yeah. Tricky Dicky did it.

111
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:21,863
- Dicky did it.
- Weren't you supposed to be

112
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,026
training Micky right now?

113
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,697
- No, it ain't till 9:00.
- Dicky, it's fucking 11:45!

114
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,365
- It's 11:45, Dick.
- What?!

115
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:33,034
Where'd you fuckin'
park the car, Boo Boo?!

116
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,204
I didn't park it. You did.
I didn't park it.

117
00:08:35,347 --> 00:08:36,746
Check your fuckin' pockets
for the keys.

118
00:08:36,882 --> 00:08:39,282
- You got the keys, yeah?
- I didn't park it, man.

119
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:42,182
- Down there? I don't know.
- Check your pockets, all right?

120
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:44,118
- You're fuckin' mental.
- Fuck it!

121
00:08:44,256 --> 00:08:46,349
I'll run. I need the fuckin' roadwork.

122
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:51,555
- Roadwork? Are you crazy?
- He's a great runner.

123
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:18,790
Hey.

124
00:09:18,924 --> 00:09:19,982
Hey!

125
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:22,919
Quacka!

126
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:26,657
- Hey, Dicky.
- Better late than never.

127
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:29,791
Oh, look! Detective's on the scene.

128
00:09:33,138 --> 00:09:35,368
Gonna get to the bottom of this.

129
00:09:35,507 --> 00:09:39,603
- Figure this one out, huh?
- Dick, you're an asshole.

130
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,235
Hold it, hold it.
Let me get this straight.

131
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:44,816
You guys are working in the same corner
as Micky, together, right?

132
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:47,783
Yeah. Yeah, they're both in my corner,
and this is what goes on.

133
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,217
OK.

134
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:51,152
Don't you have
a job to go to or something?

135
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,986
Really, O'Keefe has a job
that he should be at.

136
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:56,287
Yeah, Sergeant
O'Keefe's working overtime here.

137
00:09:56,428 --> 00:10:00,831
So we got Saoul Mamby,
Jewish, black, former world champ.

138
00:10:00,966 --> 00:10:02,831
I think we got all the bases covered.

139
00:10:02,968 --> 00:10:07,405
And my kid brother,
he's lost three fights in a row.

140
00:10:07,539 --> 00:10:09,370
You know, he can't get used
to losing. It's a mental thing.

141
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:11,772
But we're gonna break
that with Mamby, right?

142
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:13,276
Yeah, I hope, if we can train...

143
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:16,040
We can train, right. Enough of you
wasting time, Mick. You know?

144
00:10:16,181 --> 00:10:17,614
- Wasting time?
- Half the fuckin' day's gone!

145
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,741
- We got work to do.
- Yeah, half the day's gone,

146
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:21,443
- and I been waiting here for you.
- You wanna win?

147
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:32,925
Jab, two, three, four.
Left, right, punch right. Jab...

148
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:37,331
And again! One, two, three, four...

149
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,495
One, two, three, four, five...
Jab, jab...

150
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,706
There you go! There you go!

151
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:54,082
Come on, move!
Might as well drop the weight,

152
00:10:54,219 --> 00:10:55,811
we're gonna out-box Mamby.

153
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:59,114
- Take it out on the mitts.
- Head, body, head.

154
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:00,691
That's your fuckin' combo.
Head, body, head.

155
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,260
Head, body, head, body.
My Dicky taught him that.

156
00:11:03,395 --> 00:11:06,091
You know,
Sugar Ray's gonna be there,

157
00:11:06,231 --> 00:11:08,859
calling the fight for ESPN.

158
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:12,266
I ain't seen him
since I knocked him down.

159
00:11:12,404 --> 00:11:14,463
Like 14 years ago or somethin'. Right?

160
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:16,897
Hook!

161
00:11:17,042 --> 00:11:19,135
Let's get
a real sparring going on here.

162
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:20,745
Don't wanna embarrass yourself.

163
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:23,006
Don't wanna embarrass yourself
in front of Sugar Ray, do you, Mick?

164
00:11:23,148 --> 00:11:25,878
- You got him...
- Come on. Head, body, head!

165
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,144
Fuck.

166
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,921
- Fuckin' yeah. That's your punch, Mick.
- Oh, my God.

167
00:11:31,056 --> 00:11:32,683
That's your punch.

168
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:35,521
That's your liver punch.
It shuts the whole fuckin' body down.

169
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:39,028
George's fingers are so fuckin' fat,
he can't even dial the phone!

170
00:11:40,265 --> 00:11:42,165
Hey, right there, Tar!

171
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:44,735
That's not helping, George!

172
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,031
- Hold on. Wait a minute. I'm confused.
- What?

173
00:11:47,172 --> 00:11:49,037
- Yeah, I'm confused, too.
- We're confused.

174
00:11:49,174 --> 00:11:51,642
- George is whose father?
- You're confused?

175
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:56,544
- Dick Eklund Sr. Is Dicky's...
- Donna's, Gail's and Phyllis's father.

176
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:57,910
- Is Dick Eklund.
- Yeah.

177
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:01,850
And even though Alice is an Eklund,
so is Cindy and Cathy,

178
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:05,047
- George is really their...
- And Micky...

179
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:07,181
- No. Micky and I are...
- Sherri Ward.

180
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:08,554
- We're Wards.
- The Wards.

181
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:12,790
It's not the way it sounds. Dick Eklund
and I were separated, right?

182
00:12:12,931 --> 00:12:16,264
And then there was George,
just George. George is my man.

183
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:20,668
- Georgie's our poppa.
- After Dick, it was just George.

184
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,635
Charlene! Charlene!

185
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:28,070
Hey, Charlene!

186
00:12:28,213 --> 00:12:31,011
- We're doing shots with Charlene!
- Yeah, you get over here.

187
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:34,313
- Come on! Come over here.
- Come on, drink yours.

188
00:12:36,121 --> 00:12:38,112
On the count of three... Three!

189
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:44,023
Good job, fellas.
Oh, hey, one more time.

190
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:53,599
Why don't you just go talk to her?
She's a nice girl.

191
00:12:54,506 --> 00:12:56,974
I told her all about you.

192
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,475
I don't wanna ask her
if she's gonna say no.

193
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:03,606
Can't beat that ass, can ya?

194
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:07,480
Get out of the booth.
Come on. Come on.

195
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,519
Are you just gonna stand there
and stare at my ass?

196
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:20,689
Your father stares at my ass,
but he talks to me.

197
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,926
Thinks you're the greatest.

198
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:25,502
- He didn't tell me you were mute.
- Keep the change, doll.

199
00:13:25,637 --> 00:13:26,968
He told me you're
Kenny Fleming's sister.

200
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:28,801
- This is a tip?
- Yeah, that's my tip.

201
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:30,533
You know what the bell
says about this tip?

202
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:33,338
Cheap bastard. Cheap fucker.

203
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,276
Comes in here every day,
gives me shitty tips.

204
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:37,974
- Fuck that.
- Yeah, fuck you, too.

205
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:41,484
- Forget it, boys...
- You pave streets, right?

206
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,781
- Yeah, I do. And I'm a fighter.
- Oh, yeah,

207
00:13:43,922 --> 00:13:45,412
I heard you were a stepping-stone.

208
00:13:45,557 --> 00:13:50,859
- No, I'm no stepping-stone.
- You're the guy they use,

209
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,226
against the other fighters
to move the other fighters up.

210
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:55,390
I've had a few tough fights,
but that's not who I am.

211
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:57,934
The next fight's gonna show who I am.

212
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,163
Yeah, and he's
gonna lose that one, too.

213
00:14:00,305 --> 00:14:02,933
Scotch and soda, Charlene.
And one for yourself.

214
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:06,010
So move that sugar ass
and get my...

215
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:08,079
You be nice. OK?

216
00:14:08,213 --> 00:14:09,874
Be respectful.
Don't disrespect her.

217
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,711
Hey, don't hurt your hands.
We got a fight next week.

218
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:15,319
Besides, you wipe
your ass with that one.

219
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:17,388
Don't lean up, or I'm gonna hit you
in the cocksucker.

220
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,549
- He's gonna beat Saoul Mamby, say it!
- Yeah, he's gonna beat him!

221
00:14:20,692 --> 00:14:23,786
Right? Right? Hey!

222
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:26,090
- Right.
- That's right!

223
00:14:26,231 --> 00:14:27,789
I'm gonna take your drink, as well.
I'm taking his drink.

224
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:30,766
Hey, this guy's gonna be champion.
He's a great guy.

225
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:34,031
He's a great fighter. You can't
go wrong. Thanks for the drink.

226
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:36,641
Those cameras are makin'
a movie about him.

227
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:39,107
He knocked down
Sugar Ray Leonard on HBO,

228
00:14:39,244 --> 00:14:40,905
that's why they're following him
around with the camera.

229
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,775
And now they're making
a movie about his comeback.

230
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:45,543
Yeah, everybody's talking about it.
But who are you fightin'?

231
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:48,380
- Saoul Mamby.
- Saoul Mamby?

232
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,580
- What kind of name is that?
- Black and Jewish.

233
00:14:51,723 --> 00:14:53,816
Where did they find a guy like that?

234
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:55,790
He's no joke. Former world champ.

235
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:58,260
- Former champ?
- Yeah.

236
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,331
- I match up good with him though.
- Yeah?

237
00:15:00,465 --> 00:15:02,160
- Yeah.
- What does that mean?

238
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:05,236
Well, I got lighter, you know?
I have a reputation for brawlin',

239
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,998
but I'm not gonna brawl with him.
I'm gonna try and out-box him.

240
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,767
- And there's a difference?
- Yeah, you know.

241
00:15:09,908 --> 00:15:12,103
Brawlin', you slug it out.
I hit you, you hit me.

242
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:15,543
Boxing's a chess game, you know?
I pick my punches to take him down.

243
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:18,206
And go head, body, head, body.

244
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:22,245
- What is "head, body, head, body"?
- Well, I hit him in the head,

245
00:15:22,387 --> 00:15:24,719
and then his hand's gonna go up
to protect himself,

246
00:15:24,856 --> 00:15:26,790
so it opens up his body,
and then when I hit him in the body,

247
00:15:26,925 --> 00:15:29,223
the hand goes back down,
I go back up to the head,

248
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:31,329
hand goes back up, hit him in the body.

249
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:33,954
People who don't know fighting
think you can do a lot of damage

250
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:37,933
hitting somebody in the head,
but you do more hitting 'em in the body.

251
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,664
So what do you think?
Can I take you out?

252
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:44,937
Are you married?

253
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:46,942
No. Would I ask you out
if I was married?

254
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:49,206
- What kind of guy do you think I am?
- Happens all the time. Trust me.

255
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:51,009
I'm not like that.

256
00:15:51,149 --> 00:15:54,118
I'm not married. I got a daughter.
I see her every other weekend.

257
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:56,619
Her name's Kasie. But that's it.

258
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:58,950
Come on. Let me take you out.

259
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:02,488
When?

260
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,960
Saturday night.
I get back from Atlantic City.

261
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,908
- Is this the real number?
- You have to call it and see.

262
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:28,451
I will. Saturday. Dinner and a movie.

263
00:16:51,109 --> 00:16:52,804
- Hey. Jimmy.
- Micky, hey. How's it going?

264
00:16:52,944 --> 00:16:55,105
I don't think Laurie's
expecting you right now.

265
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:59,115
What's he doin' here?
This isn't your visitation day, Micky.

266
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:01,412
Look, I just want to say hi to Kasie.

267
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:03,111
It's not your day. Good-bye.

268
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:05,189
Yeah, but I'm not
around next weekend.

269
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:09,590
- You ditchin' the days you do have?
- No, I have a fight. I told you that.

270
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:14,391
- Jimmy...
- I can't get in the middle.

271
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,661
I can't talk to her, OK?
So I'm asking you, Jimmy.

272
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:20,033
I want to talk to my daughter. Now.

273
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:22,606
- Talk to your father.
- Goddamn it, Jimmy.

274
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:24,641
Daddy's gonna fight Saoul Mamby.

275
00:17:24,776 --> 00:17:26,641
That's right. I want
to tell you that after I win,

276
00:17:26,778 --> 00:17:29,747
I'm gonna start making good money,
and I'll move into a bigger apartment

277
00:17:29,881 --> 00:17:32,111
like we talked about
so you can live with me more days, OK?

278
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,150
- Yeah, bigger apartment!
- Wish me luck, all right?

279
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:37,722
Don't hold your breath, Kasie.
It's cruel to mislead your child, Micky.

280
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:39,323
Good luck, Daddy.

281
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:42,757
Thanks, Kasie.
I love you, honey. Bye, baby.

282
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:45,452
Where is he?

283
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:48,566
Jesus Christ.
Un-fucking-believable.

284
00:17:56,274 --> 00:17:58,902
- Quit worrying, for crying out loud.
- Blow that shit in my face.

285
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:03,305
You know, it's none of my business.
I go to a lot of meetings,

286
00:18:03,448 --> 00:18:06,315
and they have a saying,
"Let Go and Let God."

287
00:18:06,451 --> 00:18:08,749
- You gotta let him go, Mick.
- He's taught me everything I know.

288
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:11,617
He's been in my corner.
I can't do it without him.

289
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,190
You're already doing it without him.

290
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:15,816
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

291
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:18,953
Look, you know where he is.
Why don't you just go get him?

292
00:18:19,097 --> 00:18:22,191
- Can you get him?
- I'm not fuckin' going to get him.

293
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:26,202
Are we all gonna go over there in
the limo with Alice? We can't do that.

294
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:36,346
Dicky.

295
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,044
- Your mother's outside.
- What?

296
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:45,117
Dicky, your mother's outside!
She's down there!

297
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:50,989
I'm not here.

298
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:54,888
- Oh, no.
- What?

299
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:56,557
- I gotta go check...
- Dicky, no!

300
00:18:56,701 --> 00:18:58,601
Don't, Dicky! Dicky!

301
00:18:58,737 --> 00:18:59,965
- He's goin'...
- Dicky...

302
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:01,732
...better get out of here.
- Dicky, no!

303
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,036
Quacka, what the fuck are you doing?

304
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:07,372
You know we gotta go to the airport
now. We got a flight to catch.

305
00:19:07,512 --> 00:19:10,037
You know how important
this fight is to me.

306
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:12,241
Hey, don't tell Ma I'm here,
all right?

307
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:13,442
- She knows!
- No, no, no.

308
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:15,519
- Pick me up back at the house.
- Are you fucking...

309
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,713
- I'll go through the yards.
- She's in the driveway right now.

310
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:19,790
All right, but hurry up.
She's in the fuckin' driveway.

311
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:21,620
- We got a flight to catch.
- You son of a bitch.

312
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,194
You do this on the day your
brother's traveling?!

313
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:26,922
What are you doing?

314
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:28,794
- Why'd you make me do that?
- What the fuck you hit him for?

315
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:30,231
Why'd you make me do that to you?

316
00:19:30,368 --> 00:19:31,630
- Jesus!
- Oh, my God, Dicky.

317
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,294
I was on my way! Ma...

318
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:36,635
- What are you doing in this place?
- There you go. There you go.

319
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:39,471
Why can't we just go to the fuckin'
airport for once, please?

320
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:42,375
- We got a plane to catch.
- Hey, Alice, what about your husband?

321
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,982
He's laying on the fuckin' ground.
You wanna help your husband?

322
00:19:45,116 --> 00:19:47,846
What are you doing running in here
like a silverback fuckin' gorilla?

323
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:50,477
- We had to get him, for Chrissakes.
- Yeah, you got him all right.

324
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:52,055
You got him, pal.

325
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:13,506
You see Mamby?
You see how Mamby's arm comes up?

326
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:17,046
Leaves his side open, you just
light him up like a pinball machine.

327
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:20,618
He's gonna be pissin' blood.
No way you lose, Mick. No way.

328
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:22,276
- Hey, Lou.
- Dicky boy.

329
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:25,787
Hey, listen, what? ESPN can't
get us better rooms than this?

330
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:27,619
I wouldn't worry about
the rooms right now, Dicky.

331
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:30,057
- We got bigger headaches.
- Like what?

332
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:33,995
- Doctor won't let Mamby fight.
- Why not?

333
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:36,259
- He's got the flu.
- Mamby got the flu?

334
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:37,493
Yeah.

335
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:38,967
Micky, we can still have a fight.

336
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:41,902
- With who?
- Mike Mungin.

337
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,234
Mike who, Mungin?
Who's that?

338
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,240
Guy from Philly?
Isn't he in prison?

339
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:48,175
He's been out a few months. I've
called everybody, checked everywhere.

340
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:50,440
He's the only guy I could find.

341
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:53,244
My last few fights were rough, Lou.
This one's supposed to be easier.

342
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:55,512
I mean, we've been fuckin'
preparing for Mamby.

343
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:57,349
Yeah, but this guy
just came off the couch.

344
00:20:57,489 --> 00:21:00,754
He's been sittin' on his ass.
Could be an easy win for Mick.

345
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,085
Joey Ferrell, remember him?
He knocked his ass out.

346
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:05,753
Micky knocked out Joey Ferrell.

347
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:08,024
Exactly.
And Mungin just got off the couch.

348
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:10,100
Can't make weight.
Might be a bit over, though.

349
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:13,329
- How over?
- Maybe 162, 165.

350
00:21:13,471 --> 00:21:17,601
One-sixty-five?
Micky dropped weight. He's 146.

351
00:21:17,742 --> 00:21:21,303
Lou, we prepared for Mamby. All right?
We prepared for Mamby.

352
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:24,438
This guy just got off the couch.
Micky's in shape.

353
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:27,882
Roadwork, everything else.
This other guy, he hasn't done dick.

354
00:21:28,019 --> 00:21:31,614
Don't forget, you don't fight,
nobody gets paid.

355
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:37,561
OK.

356
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:43,158
So, Lou... Come on, please.

357
00:21:43,301 --> 00:21:46,270
Mick...
Joey Ferrell knocked him out.

358
00:21:46,404 --> 00:21:47,837
Gonna be a hell of a fight, huh?

359
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:51,875
- I'm not doing this. 165 is big.
- You knocked out Joey Ferrell.

360
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:55,002
- So what? He's a middleweight.
- He just got off the couch.

361
00:21:55,146 --> 00:21:57,637
He's got 20 pounds on me, Dicky.

362
00:21:57,782 --> 00:22:00,546
Joey Ferrell knocked him out,
you knocked out Joey Ferrell.

363
00:22:00,685 --> 00:22:03,279
- You just said that.
- Yeah, right. You can't be scared.

364
00:22:03,421 --> 00:22:04,581
- Scared?
- Yeah.

365
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:07,021
- Why don't you go fuckin' fight him?
- I'll go fuckin' fight him. He's fat.

366
00:22:07,158 --> 00:22:09,251
Good. Snap out the teeth.
This is your big comeback, right?

367
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:12,795
- That's what Alice wants.
- You knocked out Joey Ferrell.

368
00:22:12,931 --> 00:22:16,162
All right. I knocked out Joey Ferrell,
OK? But the guy is a middleweight.

369
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:19,361
I'm a welterweight. They didn't have
a fuckin' heavyweight to throw in there?

370
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:22,064
Tell him, Dicky. He can do it, right?
He can do anything.

371
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:24,437
Oh, yeah, Alice. No problem.

372
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:26,908
You watch from the outside, pal.

373
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:32,312
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
Mike "Machine Gun" Mungin!</i>

374
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:36,310
Holy shit.

375
00:22:36,454 --> 00:22:38,752
Hey, hey, look.
That's Sugar Ray Leonard.

376
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:40,585
Hey, Ray. Ray, Ray, Ray.

377
00:22:40,725 --> 00:22:43,353
- Hey, Ray! Sugar Ray! Over here!
- Dicky.

378
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:45,292
Come on, look at the size of that guy.

379
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,730
- Holy shit.
- Yeah, holy shit.

380
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,459
That guy's no welterweight.

381
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:54,365
All right, Mick. We'll have to run
the first few rounds, tire him out.

382
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:55,905
He did not just get off
the fuckin' couch.

383
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,941
If he did,
I'm gonna buy a couch like that.

384
00:22:58,076 --> 00:23:00,306
I don't care who that guy is...

385
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:02,743
Look at me.
You're Micky Ward.

386
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:05,076
You're Micky Ward.

387
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:11,253
Micky Ward, fighting a last-minute
replacement from Philadelphia.

388
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:13,823
Ward, thrown around
by a much bigger man!

389
00:23:13,958 --> 00:23:16,927
- Punches, smashing Ward back!
- Jab!

390
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:18,861
Now it's big Mike...

391
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:22,262
Ward goes down! Ward goes down!

392
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,335
- Come on! Come on!
...four, five...

393
00:23:26,604 --> 00:23:27,901
...six...

394
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:30,439
Micky Ward's a fuckin' bum!
Get rid of this dude!

395
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:31,735
- Shut up!
- Motherfucker!

396
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:35,640
Mungin didn't even
know he'd be fighting today.

397
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,577
Hey, you, back off!

398
00:23:41,286 --> 00:23:42,275
Come on! No, no, no, Mick!

399
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:46,213
Ward, a respected fighter.

400
00:23:46,357 --> 00:23:48,621
You hope this mismatch
doesn't hurt his confidence.

401
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:52,753
- You're a loser!
- You're a loser!

402
00:24:14,652 --> 00:24:15,812
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

403
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:17,615
<i>before we get started,
a lot of people have been asking</i>

404
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:20,520
<i>about the big night
of boxing on November 4.</i>

405
00:24:20,658 --> 00:24:22,956
<i>Three world championship bouts...</i>

406
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:26,029
Ray! Hey, Ray! Ray!

407
00:24:27,532 --> 00:24:30,865
- Hey!
- Dicky. How you doin', man?

408
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:33,232
- How are ya?
- All right, man.

409
00:24:33,371 --> 00:24:36,932
He's 165 pounds.
ESPN screwed us. You know?

410
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:40,272
- The guy was huge.
- Hey. You know, I...

411
00:24:40,411 --> 00:24:42,402
I knocked Ray down.

412
00:24:42,547 --> 00:24:44,208
I look like shit,
but I knocked Ray down.

413
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:46,749
Hey, let me buy
you guys a drink. All right?

414
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:48,876
- Want a cold one?
- No, no, no.

415
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,386
I got to leave. I got a plane to catch.
Next time, right?

416
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:54,424
Hey, Ray, wait, wait. HBO's makin'
a movie on me. You know?

417
00:24:55,593 --> 00:24:57,083
Can I call ya?

418
00:24:57,228 --> 00:25:00,925
I'm gonna get a fight, and I just like
ya to be there for old time's sakes.

419
00:25:01,065 --> 00:25:03,727
- You commentate or something.
- What's the movie about?

420
00:25:03,868 --> 00:25:06,098
My comeback. Right?

421
00:25:06,237 --> 00:25:09,070
- Call me. Love you, brother.
- I'll call ya.

422
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:10,697
You don't be a stranger!

423
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:13,739
He's funny,
"What's the movie about?"

424
00:25:13,878 --> 00:25:14,867
What's that?

425
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:17,504
You can do better. You're too
good a boxer, I've watched you.

426
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:19,674
- Are you going to the hospital?
- What is that?

427
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:23,618
- They said I need to get stitches.
- Mick, nobody's got heart like you.

428
00:25:23,755 --> 00:25:26,690
You're a very talented fighter,
but you're not getting the right fights.

429
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:29,191
- It's killing your chances.
- What's he talking to Mike Toma for?

430
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:31,852
- I don't know, Dick.
- I want to give you a real shot.

431
00:25:31,996 --> 00:25:35,557
I want you to come with me.
I want to pay you to train with my guys.

432
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,065
- Where?
- Las Vegas.

433
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:40,433
Do it right and make one last run
at this thing before it's too late.

434
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:42,130
What about my brother?

435
00:25:42,273 --> 00:25:44,741
With all due respect,
he's too much trouble.

436
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:48,004
You owe it to yourself
to come to Vegas.

437
00:25:48,146 --> 00:25:50,671
Come on, Mick,
what has Dicky done for you?

438
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:53,579
He got you into fights, he lets
you get beat, like you did tonight.

439
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:57,381
You shouldn't have been in that fight.
Eighteen pounds, think of it that way.

440
00:25:57,522 --> 00:25:58,989
You should've given it up.

441
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:03,618
Sit down in the car there.
Come on, you.

442
00:26:03,761 --> 00:26:06,628
- Sit the hell down.
- A little more Scotch for Mama.

443
00:26:06,764 --> 00:26:09,255
There you go. Nice and easy.
Don't hurt yourself coming back.

444
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,301
- Will ya, ya old broad ya?
- Oh, my God.

445
00:26:12,437 --> 00:26:15,702
Oh, my God, that Sugar Ray,
he's a beautiful man, isn't he?

446
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,205
He didn't recognize me
straight away.

447
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:19,173
You seen the way
he was looking at me?

448
00:26:20,511 --> 00:26:22,411
He's a good guy.
I like him, I like him.

449
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:26,576
I seen him on ringside, he was
so happy seeing me and Mick together.

450
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:29,653
He's all about family, that guy.
Loves to see a family stick together.

451
00:26:29,787 --> 00:26:33,484
Mick, what'd Mike Toma
want with you last night?

452
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:35,855
- He wants to train me in Vegas.
- What?

453
00:26:35,994 --> 00:26:38,189
You can't trust that guy, Micky.
He ain't family, you know?

454
00:26:38,329 --> 00:26:42,891
You don't know him. He say anything
about me? Did he say I could come?

455
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:44,865
He didn't mention you.

456
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:49,502
What are you gonna do in Vegas
without your brother?

457
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:51,939
That guy just wants to use you
like a piece of toilet paper.

458
00:26:52,076 --> 00:26:54,476
What are you gonna do in Vegas
without Dicky? Without your family?

459
00:26:54,612 --> 00:26:57,376
- I know, that's what I told him.
- You told him that, right?

460
00:26:57,515 --> 00:27:00,313
Yeah, I told him. I said that I needed
to be with my family in Lowell.

461
00:27:00,451 --> 00:27:02,715
That's right.
Nothing wrong with that.

462
00:27:02,854 --> 00:27:04,685
Sugar Ray said call him.
We're gonna call him, baby.

463
00:27:04,822 --> 00:27:05,811
That's right.

464
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:08,016
You guys can spar a little, right?

465
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,218
Where are they?

466
00:27:10,361 --> 00:27:12,192
- There's my champ!
- Daddy's home!

467
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:16,096
- Daddy's home! Daddy's home!
- Give him a big hug.

468
00:27:16,234 --> 00:27:17,292
I love you!

469
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:19,363
Thank you.

470
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:21,529
Your face hurting you, sweetheart?

471
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:25,871
No? 'Cause it's killing me.
Come on.

472
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:27,238
Did Uncle Micky win the fight?

473
00:27:27,378 --> 00:27:30,006
No, Micky didn't win this time.
Not this time.

474
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:33,675
Hey, Mick, you take care.
I'll call you tomorrow.

475
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:36,184
Cheer up. We'll get you another fight.

476
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,448
I don't know, Ma. I don't
think I wanna do this no more.

477
00:27:38,589 --> 00:27:39,988
What don't you wanna do no more?

478
00:27:40,124 --> 00:27:41,614
Just, I don't wanna do it anymore.

479
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:46,025
- What are you?
- Hey, Mick, ESPN screwed us.

480
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:50,567
All right? They owe us. We'll get
another fight. You'll heal up.

481
00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:53,102
- It's gonna be OK.
- Yeah, listen to your brother.

482
00:27:53,237 --> 00:27:55,205
They owe us big-time, sweetheart.

483
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,069
Maybe they'll even
do Dicky's comeback fight.

484
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:58,732
What do you think?

485
00:27:59,744 --> 00:28:02,304
Oh, come on, cheer up. You take
a little soak when you get home,

486
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:04,642
have a day or two to think about it.
I'll find you a better fight.

487
00:28:04,782 --> 00:28:06,477
A much better fight.
I'm gonna talk to them.

488
00:28:06,617 --> 00:28:09,051
- For Chrissakes, Alice.
- What?

489
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,779
He's been through the ringer.
Leave him alone, will ya?

490
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:11,911
What are you talking about?

491
00:28:12,056 --> 00:28:13,887
Let him get some time to himself.
He just got finished.

492
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:15,890
- What's your fuckin' problem?
- Come on.

493
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:18,154
Where's Micky?
Is Micky not gonna come in?

494
00:28:18,296 --> 00:28:21,060
No, he's not coming in.
He needs to get back and get some rest.

495
00:28:21,966 --> 00:28:23,729
Come on, let's go inside.

496
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:26,166
No. He's gonna go rest.
He's all grumpy.

497
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:28,772
He's beat up,
he's a little embarrassed, I think.

498
00:28:28,906 --> 00:28:30,669
Look at him.
Have you even seen him?

499
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:30,360
Who is it?

500
00:29:51,222 --> 00:29:53,554
I saw the shade move.

501
00:29:53,691 --> 00:29:55,454
Micky, the shade is still moving.

502
00:29:55,593 --> 00:29:58,824
I saw you come to the window,
I know you're in there.

503
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:01,830
Least you can do is open up
this door and tell me to my face

504
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:04,161
why you didn't call me yesterday.

505
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:11,405
Why'd you stand me up last night?

506
00:30:12,543 --> 00:30:15,808
I started to call. I was gonna call,
but... I just couldn't.

507
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:17,471
'Cause you lost the fight?

508
00:30:17,615 --> 00:30:20,209
Maybe, yeah.
'Cause I lost the fight.

509
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:22,148
How'd you know my house, anyway?

510
00:30:22,286 --> 00:30:24,083
I asked my brother.

511
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:27,056
Your thing's coming off.

512
00:30:27,191 --> 00:30:29,091
I mean your other thing.

513
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:32,856
You got any tape?

514
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:43,802
Did the black Jewish guy
do this to you?

515
00:30:43,941 --> 00:30:47,342
I didn't get to fight
the black Jewish guy.

516
00:30:47,478 --> 00:30:51,175
You didn't get to go
head, body, head?

517
00:30:51,315 --> 00:30:55,217
Saoul Mamby got the flu. Guy who
took his place had 20 pounds on me.

518
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:58,049
I never should've fought him.

519
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:02,853
- Why did you?
- Nobody would've got paid.

520
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:05,758
Everybody said I could've beat him.

521
00:31:05,897 --> 00:31:08,263
Who's everybody?

522
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:11,197
My mother, my brother.

523
00:31:13,804 --> 00:31:16,898
So are you gonna take me
to dinner and a movie, or what?

524
00:31:44,101 --> 00:31:46,865
- Hey.
- Hey.

525
00:31:49,373 --> 00:31:51,364
- You look great.
- Thank you.

526
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:53,340
Got a nice house, too.

527
00:31:53,477 --> 00:31:55,536
It's an apartment building.
There's five of 'em in there.

528
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,375
One of my old roommates lives in one.

529
00:31:57,515 --> 00:31:58,914
Roommate?
What, were you in the Army?

530
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:01,177
- College.
- College. Wow.

531
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:03,947
Yeah, a lot of good it did me.
I work in a bar.

532
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:06,989
Well, you seem to enjoy it.
You're very popular down there.

533
00:32:07,124 --> 00:32:09,684
Yeah, popular.
I gotta get out of there.

534
00:32:09,827 --> 00:32:12,387
If I don't drink while I'm working,
I'll fuckin' kill myself.

535
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:15,624
- What college?
- URI. Full boat.

536
00:32:15,766 --> 00:32:16,926
Full boat's a scholarship, right?

537
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:19,229
- Yeah.
- For what?

538
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:22,703
- I was a high jumper.
- High jumper? You gotta be kidding me.

539
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:26,139
Fuck you. I was good. I was
New England champ. I cleared 5' 8".

540
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:29,212
- Wow.
- Never graduated. I partied too hard.

541
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:30,507
You?

542
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,893
What are we doing
in Richie Rich Lexington?

543
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:49,363
You come to this theater a lot?

544
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,468
Yeah, it's a good theater.
They got good movies here.

545
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:54,628
<i>- Yeah, like what?
- Belli Epi-que.</i>

546
00:32:54,772 --> 00:32:58,503
<i>I think it's Belle Epic.
It's "epic." Belle Epic.</i>

547
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:01,771
<i>Belle Epoque.
The New York Times loved it.</i>

548
00:33:01,912 --> 00:33:03,777
Well, I never heard of it.

549
00:33:03,914 --> 00:33:06,007
<i>Where'd you hear about it?
The New York Times?</i>

550
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,414
No, a guy from work.

551
00:33:08,552 --> 00:33:10,383
And the cinematography
is supposed to be gorgeous.

552
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:11,818
Oh, cool.

553
00:33:28,606 --> 00:33:29,903
Thank you.

554
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:42,014
That's the movie you wanted to see?

555
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:44,451
There wasn't even any good sex in it.

556
00:33:44,588 --> 00:33:47,989
Had to read the whole fuckin' movie.
Fuckin' subtitled.

557
00:33:48,993 --> 00:33:51,359
And some guy from a road crew
recommended it to you?

558
00:33:51,495 --> 00:33:53,326
A fuckin' subtitled movie?

559
00:33:54,632 --> 00:33:56,566
What's going on?

560
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:59,795
What's going on? You got a girlfriend
or something? You hiding me from her?

561
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:02,462
I don't have a girlfriend, all right?

562
00:34:02,606 --> 00:34:04,403
I... I like you.

563
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:08,340
I came here 'cause I don't
wanna show my face in Lowell.

564
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:10,913
I told everybody I was gonna win
that fight and get back on track.

565
00:34:11,048 --> 00:34:13,642
I told my daughter I was gonna get
a bigger apartment so she can move in.

566
00:34:13,784 --> 00:34:15,581
You don't think I wanted to call you?

567
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:21,022
I was embarrassed. I mean... I'm sick
of being a fuckin' disappointment. I...

568
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:28,263
You really think
your family's looking out for you?

569
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:33,465
Don't say that about my family.

570
00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:37,540
What else can I say
after what you told me?

571
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:39,700
I mean, look at your face.

572
00:34:41,178 --> 00:34:42,509
Look at you.

573
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:10,298
Bullshit, Lou. I'm not gonna
stop callin' till you make this right

574
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:12,807
and give us a fight that's fair.

575
00:35:12,943 --> 00:35:15,707
My boy could've got killed last time.

576
00:35:17,815 --> 00:35:19,442
Yeah, like what?

577
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:23,653
Just don't tell me he just
got off the fuckin' couch.

578
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:30,761
He's coming off a loss?

579
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:33,659
Sounds very interesting.
I'll get back to you.

580
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,959
We got a great opportunity here.

581
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:38,433
We gotta go find Micky.

582
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:41,367
Nobody's seen him
for like three weeks.

583
00:35:42,406 --> 00:35:43,668
Jesus.

584
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:47,300
Used to be Dicky we couldn't find,
now it's both of them?

585
00:35:47,445 --> 00:35:49,504
Ma, I think he's
with that girl from the bar.

586
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:52,639
- What girl?
- It's that fuckin' girl, Charlene.

587
00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:54,751
That's who he's with.
That girl from the bar.

588
00:35:54,885 --> 00:35:58,013
George was all fuckin' eager
for them to get together.

589
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:00,348
I heard she's into three-ways.

590
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:03,324
- Yeah, with other girls.
- Yeah, like one of those MTV girls.

591
00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:05,224
MTV...
What are you talking about?

592
00:36:05,362 --> 00:36:06,590
Wild.

593
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:09,790
She acts all fuckin' superior
'cause she went to college.

594
00:36:11,001 --> 00:36:13,629
You girls just go
find your brother, Micky.

595
00:36:13,771 --> 00:36:16,262
Tell him we've got important
business to discuss.

596
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:19,276
I've gotta go find Dicky.

597
00:36:28,185 --> 00:36:29,846
Dicky!

598
00:37:18,602 --> 00:37:21,628
Hey, Ma, there's nothing
in there. I just...

599
00:37:22,873 --> 00:37:26,138
It was just some friends I was seeing,
you know?

600
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,936
Don't worry about it, Ma.

601
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:36,716
I was just helping 'em out, you know?

602
00:37:36,854 --> 00:37:39,254
Hey, Alice...

603
00:37:40,491 --> 00:37:42,356
Alice...

604
00:37:42,493 --> 00:37:46,259
<i>I started a joke</i>

605
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:51,334
<i>Which started the whole world cryin'</i>

606
00:37:51,468 --> 00:37:55,632
<i>Oh, if only I'd seen</i>

607
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:59,504
<i>That the joke was on me</i>

608
00:37:59,643 --> 00:38:03,340
<i>I started to cry</i>

609
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:08,816
<i>Which started
the whole world laughin'</i>

610
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:12,753
<i>Oh, if only I'd seen</i>

611
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:16,223
<i>That the joke was on me</i>

612
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:20,057
<i>I looked at the skies</i>

613
00:38:20,197 --> 00:38:26,067
<i>Runnin'my hands over my eyes</i>

614
00:38:26,203 --> 00:38:31,869
<i>And I fell out of bed</i>

615
00:38:32,009 --> 00:38:34,409
<i>Hurting my head...</i>

616
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:53,955
So you're Beaver
and you're Red Bear.

617
00:38:54,098 --> 00:38:58,057
- Red Beard.
- She's Red Dog, and that's Beaver.

618
00:38:58,202 --> 00:39:00,670
You're Red Dog. You're Beaver.

619
00:39:00,804 --> 00:39:03,364
- Yeah, don't use those names.
- It's just for family.

620
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:05,372
Be nice.

621
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:07,170
Don't use the nicknames.

622
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,977
I don't think
I'll fuckin' call 'em anything.

623
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:13,711
Speaking of family...

624
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:27,358
Hello.

625
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:32,029
- Alice, this is Charlene.
- Hi.

626
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:35,061
I've heard a lot about you.

627
00:39:35,205 --> 00:39:37,173
Really? I've heard
a lot about you, too.

628
00:39:37,307 --> 00:39:39,241
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Same thing you meant.

629
00:39:39,376 --> 00:39:41,435
Can we just sit down
and talk about business?

630
00:39:42,346 --> 00:39:46,680
I got you another fight, Mick.
Just like I said I would.

631
00:39:47,651 --> 00:39:49,642
Lou Gold and ESPN made it right.

632
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:55,316
Just like I told you. Joe Belinc.
Six weeks. The Foxwoods.

633
00:39:55,459 --> 00:39:58,895
Kid's like, you know,
ten and eight, he's nothin'.

634
00:39:59,029 --> 00:40:00,326
You know? And they're
gonna pay us 20 grand.

635
00:40:00,464 --> 00:40:03,126
- Seventeen-five, Dick.
- Seventeen-five.

636
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:06,259
Which is still... good money, Mick.

637
00:40:06,403 --> 00:40:08,064
Yeah.

638
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:11,836
Yeah, that's good, Dick. I'm just,

639
00:40:11,975 --> 00:40:14,500
you know, trying to figure out
what's best for me.

640
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:19,405
Like what?

641
00:40:23,787 --> 00:40:26,085
What's best for you, sweetheart?

642
00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:28,350
Come on, Mick, I thought
you'd be more excited.

643
00:40:28,492 --> 00:40:30,858
Why ain't you more excited?
It's a good fight, good money.

644
00:40:30,994 --> 00:40:34,293
I got tough with Lou Gold.
Told him he owes us.

645
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,467
Yeah, I know, Ma. I don't want things
going the way they've been going.

646
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:43,505
Mick, that last fight,
it was unfair. That was unfair.

647
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:46,973
- And we ain't gonna repeat that. Right?
- No, not on your life.

648
00:40:48,278 --> 00:40:50,542
No, but...
It's just you in the ring.

649
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:52,239
Yeah, I know it's me in the ring.

650
00:40:52,382 --> 00:40:54,509
But I don't like the way things
have been going here.

651
00:40:54,651 --> 00:40:56,949
- Where?
- Here. This. Us. Lowell.

652
00:40:57,087 --> 00:40:58,952
The whole routine.

653
00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:01,319
- George, stay out of it.
- You're doing all the talking.

654
00:41:01,458 --> 00:41:02,857
Let him talk. Listen.

655
00:41:02,993 --> 00:41:05,826
- I'm askin' him.
- You're tellin' him.

656
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:07,362
- Listen.
- Stay out of it.

657
00:41:07,498 --> 00:41:09,295
Don't tell me to stay out of it.

658
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,691
Mick, what's the problem?

659
00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:15,569
- The problems.
- What problems?

660
00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:18,971
- Problems...
- Like what?

661
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:23,239
Like, maybe you not
showing up on time to train.

662
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:26,611
Like maybe him having to come
find you in a crack house

663
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:29,412
when you're supposed
to be at the airport.

664
00:41:31,922 --> 00:41:35,414
I'm sorry. I don't know who
you are, or why you're talking.

665
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:39,120
I'm Charlene. We just met.

666
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:42,198
We're together. Do we need
to do this again? Hi, I'm Charlene.

667
00:41:42,332 --> 00:41:44,766
Hi, I'm Charlene.

668
00:41:45,235 --> 00:41:46,224
Hi, I'm Charlene.

669
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:49,066
Hey, we're together!

670
00:41:50,073 --> 00:41:54,203
What are you gonna do, Mick? Listen
to some MTV girl who works in a bar?

671
00:41:54,344 --> 00:41:56,209
What's she know about boxing?

672
00:41:56,346 --> 00:42:01,340
I know that going to Vegas
and gettin' paid to train year-round

673
00:42:01,485 --> 00:42:03,976
sounds a hell of a lot better
than what you got him doing here.

674
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:09,750
You gonna let her talk
like that to your mother?

675
00:42:09,893 --> 00:42:11,360
Come on, Micky.

676
00:42:11,495 --> 00:42:15,056
I told you, we're together.
This is my girlfriend. I want her here.

677
00:42:16,266 --> 00:42:21,397
I have done everything...
everything I could for you, Micky.

678
00:42:21,538 --> 00:42:24,996
- This MTV girl comes along...
- Stop calling me an MTV girl,

679
00:42:25,142 --> 00:42:26,439
whatever the fuck that means.

680
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:27,976
- Skank.
- It's wild.

681
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:34,647
I've been doing this over 15 years.
She comes in, disrespects me.

682
00:42:34,785 --> 00:42:37,447
She don't mean no disrespect, OK?

683
00:42:37,588 --> 00:42:41,820
I had a chance to get paid to train
year-round, year-round, OK?

684
00:42:41,959 --> 00:42:43,221
That's all she's talking about.

685
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,328
I would hope that you guys
could appreciate that.

686
00:42:45,462 --> 00:42:49,558
I know what you're talking about.
All right? I could've had that.

687
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:55,297
You know? I had... I had opportunities,
like maybe you're gonna have.

688
00:42:55,439 --> 00:43:00,934
Now... You want money
so you can train year-round? Yeah?

689
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:02,943
I'll get you money
so you can train year-round.

690
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,071
- You? How?
- Yeah, I'll do it. Trust me.

691
00:43:05,215 --> 00:43:08,981
Hey, trust me. All right? Done.

692
00:43:10,954 --> 00:43:15,015
All right? Charlene? Yeah? Everyone?

693
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:23,024
<i>So, you put in $200, right?</i>

694
00:43:23,166 --> 00:43:25,862
Then you get ten other people
to put in 200...

695
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:29,299
...and you got your 2,000.

696
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:38,680
- Everybody give you $200?
- No, not everybody, just ten of you.

697
00:43:38,815 --> 00:43:40,373
Ten lucky ones.

698
00:43:43,987 --> 00:43:44,976
You rip us off.

699
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:46,714
No, no, I'm giving you an opportunity.

700
00:43:46,857 --> 00:43:48,950
You give me $200.

701
00:43:49,092 --> 00:43:53,085
No, you get that from ten other people
who you offer the opportunity to.

702
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:55,858
Right? You understand? No?

703
00:44:00,437 --> 00:44:03,338
He thinks you think
Cambodian people are stupid.

704
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:08,637
I love Cambodian people.
I mean, look at Karen.

705
00:44:09,513 --> 00:44:11,845
She's my girlfriend.
She's beautiful. I love her.

706
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:14,678
You know, and Brian.
We work on a road crew together.

707
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:18,345
- Well, not so much lately.
- We work on a road crew together.

708
00:44:18,488 --> 00:44:20,820
You haven't been showing up,
that's all I'm saying.

709
00:44:20,958 --> 00:44:23,654
This ain't an anti-Cambodian thing.

710
00:44:23,794 --> 00:44:25,762
White people do this
to other white people.

711
00:44:25,896 --> 00:44:28,797
- It's what makes the world go round.
- Boo Boo, I don't think that's helping.

712
00:44:28,932 --> 00:44:32,629
I mean, this is...
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

713
00:44:37,374 --> 00:44:39,569
I mean, they didn't understand.

714
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:41,837
You know, I mean,
they're practically my gang.

715
00:44:41,979 --> 00:44:45,380
Usually, they listen to what I say,
but they just didn't understand

716
00:44:45,515 --> 00:44:47,813
the opportunity, you know,
I was offering them.

717
00:44:47,951 --> 00:44:50,385
- What were we talking about?
- Before you fought Sugar Ray.

718
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:53,455
Right, right, right. I mean,
Sugar Ray was too much too soon.

719
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:57,082
You know, I needed to build up slow.
You know, right?

720
00:44:57,227 --> 00:44:59,286
What's this movie about, again?

721
00:44:59,429 --> 00:45:01,989
I told you,
it's about crack addiction.

722
00:45:02,132 --> 00:45:06,000
Showing what it really is
so kids can see it for real.

723
00:45:08,538 --> 00:45:10,233
Fuck.

724
00:45:12,509 --> 00:45:14,534
We gotta get Mick's money.

725
00:45:26,857 --> 00:45:29,417
Yes! That was awesome!

726
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:55,476
Go. Right now.

727
00:45:58,789 --> 00:46:01,417
Go, go, go...

728
00:46:14,638 --> 00:46:16,572
- Get out of the car!
- Oh, shit!

729
00:46:16,706 --> 00:46:19,368
Get out of the car, now!
Move!

730
00:46:19,509 --> 00:46:21,909
Put your hands on the roof!
Put your hands on the roof!

731
00:46:22,045 --> 00:46:23,637
- That's it! Empty your pockets!
- Are you a cop?

732
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:27,807
Go to the fuckin' sidewalk. Move!
Fuckin' move! Don't turn around!

733
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:30,647
Don't turn around!
Gonna have to take your vehicle.

734
00:46:30,787 --> 00:46:33,278
- How am I gonna get home?
- That's your problem!

735
00:46:34,724 --> 00:46:36,692
Get us some rocks.
How much we got here? Count it.

736
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:41,624
What the fuck?!

737
00:46:41,765 --> 00:46:44,461
That's the guy! He did it to me
and he's doing it again!

738
00:46:44,601 --> 00:46:48,332
- Dicky, get on the ground, right now!
- Get that fucking!

739
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:22,401
Ta-da! What do you think?

740
00:47:23,874 --> 00:47:27,275
Open the door!
Trying to get off the fuckin' street!

741
00:47:27,410 --> 00:47:31,369
What the fuck! I'm trying
to get off the fuckin' street!

742
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:33,574
Get your fuckin' hands off me!

743
00:47:36,419 --> 00:47:38,512
Did you hear me?!

744
00:47:41,258 --> 00:47:45,558
You gotta see this!
They're fuckin' up Dicky Eklund!

745
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,161
It's Dicky! It's Dicky Eklund.
The cops are all over him.

746
00:47:52,302 --> 00:47:54,896
They're fuckin' punching him,
they're beatin' him. He needs help!

747
00:47:57,174 --> 00:47:59,870
Stay here! Don't get up. Stay here!

748
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:01,875
- Listen to him. You stay right here.
- I gotta go.

749
00:48:02,012 --> 00:48:05,379
You better get back here.
Are you fuckin' kidding me?

750
00:48:13,123 --> 00:48:14,920
Hey, what the fuck? Come on,
just put him in the car!

751
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:17,618
You don't need to do that!
Just put him in the car!

752
00:48:17,761 --> 00:48:19,991
- Come on, just let him go!
- You wanna get involved?

753
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:22,428
Now you're involved!

754
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:26,002
You're fuckin' up my brother!
I'll kill you!

755
00:48:26,136 --> 00:48:28,127
He's a fighter! Break his fuckin' hands!

756
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:33,398
- Don't!
- I didn't do nothing!

757
00:48:33,543 --> 00:48:35,875
- I didn't do nothing!
- Shut the fuck up.

758
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:41,742
Move 'em out!

759
00:48:42,953 --> 00:48:45,854
Micky, your hand. Your hand.

760
00:48:46,856 --> 00:48:48,050
Don't tell me to come on.

761
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:49,988
Back up yourself, for Chrissake.

762
00:48:50,126 --> 00:48:52,526
Hey, separate cars, separate cells.

763
00:48:52,662 --> 00:48:55,722
I don't want them making up
some bullshit defense story.

764
00:48:55,865 --> 00:48:58,026
Come on, folks,
time to go home. Let's go.

765
00:48:59,669 --> 00:49:01,330
- No blankets.
- Dicky!

766
00:49:01,471 --> 00:49:02,631
What the fuck, man!

767
00:49:02,772 --> 00:49:05,570
- Micky!
- Jesus Christ.

768
00:49:05,709 --> 00:49:07,609
Don't get involved.
You shouldn't get involved, sir.

769
00:49:07,744 --> 00:49:09,177
Look at his hands.

770
00:49:09,312 --> 00:49:10,506
Shit.

771
00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:16,945
Go home, folks. Good night!

772
00:49:36,773 --> 00:49:40,368
Welcome back, Dicky.
That's 27 arrests.

Case continued, two weeks from today.

779
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:15,641
- Come on.
- Judy, can I have the file three-57?

780
00:50:15,779 --> 00:50:18,873
I need a copy
of the discovery reports as well.

781
00:50:22,786 --> 00:50:24,686
Mick, you're gonna say it
was self-defense, right?

782
00:50:24,821 --> 00:50:25,981
- You did it to yourself, Dicky.
- What?

783
00:50:26,122 --> 00:50:27,384
You're gonna say it was
self-defense, right?

784
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:30,288
You came outside, you seen them
beatin' on me, I didn't do nothin'.

785
00:50:30,427 --> 00:50:33,328
Right? I was just waitin' outside like
anybody? Mick, I was doing it for you!

786
00:50:33,463 --> 00:50:34,930
You did it for me? What, this?

787
00:50:35,065 --> 00:50:37,659
Do me a favor, don't do fuckin'
nothing for me no more, OK?

788
00:50:37,801 --> 00:50:39,564
I'm fuckin' done lyin' for you.

789
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,796
What are you
gonna do without me?

790
00:50:42,872 --> 00:50:45,306
This isn't how it was meant to go down!

791
00:50:45,442 --> 00:50:47,342
They should've just put me in the car!

792
00:50:48,244 --> 00:50:51,042
Oh, Mick, come on! Mick!

793
00:51:04,327 --> 00:51:07,592
Dicky!
Hey, what's up, Dicky?!

794
00:51:08,832 --> 00:51:11,232
Hey, Eklund!

795
00:51:11,368 --> 00:51:12,960
Dicky!

796
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:15,932
Hey, you knocked out Sugar Ray!

797
00:51:16,072 --> 00:51:18,973
Dicky, Dicky, Dicky...

798
00:52:01,885 --> 00:52:03,318
Who is it?

799
00:52:09,759 --> 00:52:11,852
<i>I don't want to see you, Micky.</i>

800
00:52:11,995 --> 00:52:15,362
<i>- Charlene...
- I can't take it.</i>

801
00:52:15,498 --> 00:52:18,433
<i>I'm not gonna let you
or your family drag me down.</i>

802
00:52:18,568 --> 00:52:21,128
I'm quitting, Charlene, OK?
I'm done fightin'.

803
00:52:21,271 --> 00:52:23,262
I don't need it anymore.

804
00:52:23,907 --> 00:52:27,206
<i>- That's fuckin' stupid.
- What? Why?</i>

805
00:52:27,343 --> 00:52:29,709
Because it's sad that you
let them take it away from you

806
00:52:29,846 --> 00:52:31,746
with their stupid bullshit.

807
00:52:33,349 --> 00:52:36,045
<i>What else can I do, Charlene?</i>

808
00:52:36,186 --> 00:52:37,744
There's a lot you can do, Micky.

809
00:52:37,887 --> 00:52:39,650
There's this guy that
your dad wants you to meet.

810
00:52:39,789 --> 00:52:42,587
You just don't think you
can do it without Dicky.

811
00:52:42,725 --> 00:52:45,091
Charlene...

812
00:52:45,228 --> 00:52:46,593
<i>Don't call.</i>

813
00:52:46,729 --> 00:52:48,754
Come on.

814
00:52:48,898 --> 00:52:50,525
<i>Don't call me, OK?</i>

815
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:02,209
Hey, Dicky, you hurtin', man?

816
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:05,871
Poor fucker!

817
00:53:09,052 --> 00:53:10,610
Hang in there, man!

818
00:53:10,753 --> 00:53:12,482
Go, Dicky!

819
00:53:19,162 --> 00:53:20,789
Hey, Dicky!

820
00:53:21,798 --> 00:53:24,130
Hey, keep it quiet!

821
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:42,817
Hey, Micky!
Bring another bucket, huh?

822
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:46,150
Good.

823
00:53:56,699 --> 00:53:59,532
<i>And this Friday,
an HBO original documentary.</i>

824
00:53:59,669 --> 00:54:02,638
<i>Right here in Lowell, Mass,
the story of Dick Eklund,</i>

825
00:54:02,772 --> 00:54:04,865
<i>a once-promising boxer
who turned criminal...</i>

826
00:54:19,656 --> 00:54:21,180
Oh, look who it is.

827
00:54:24,861 --> 00:54:26,226
That's him.
That's Dicky's brother.

828
00:54:26,362 --> 00:54:27,624
- Hey, Micky.
- Regular.

829
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,630
Hey.

830
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:36,061
- Hey, what's up, Mick?
- Look who's here.

831
00:54:38,007 --> 00:54:40,373
- Good to see you, bro.
- How you doing?

832
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:42,637
How you feeling? How's the hand?

833
00:54:43,813 --> 00:54:46,145
- It's gettin' there.
- Looks better.

834
00:54:46,282 --> 00:54:49,945
Why don't you come down to the gym?
And work out. If you want.

835
00:54:50,086 --> 00:54:53,283
- Hey, you fat fuck, you're getting big.
- Yeah, I know. I just...

836
00:54:53,423 --> 00:54:55,482
Been roofin' with my father,
spending time with Kasie.

837
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:57,490
Now I gotta worry about
this movie on HBO tonight.

838
00:54:57,627 --> 00:54:59,117
What are yous looking at?

839
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:03,091
Movie's not about him.
It's about his crazy brother.

840
00:55:03,232 --> 00:55:04,961
I gotta go.

841
00:55:05,101 --> 00:55:07,763
- Come back to the gym, Mick.
- Bye, Mick!

842
00:55:07,904 --> 00:55:10,930
Don't go watch
that crazy shit on TV, don't!

843
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:18,208
Hollywood!

844
00:55:19,248 --> 00:55:22,547
Get a look! Get a look, all right!

845
00:55:23,386 --> 00:55:27,254
Going to Hollywood!
Going to Hollywood, yeah!

846
00:55:32,028 --> 00:55:33,859
All right!

847
00:55:42,205 --> 00:55:43,763
All right, get this started!

848
00:55:56,919 --> 00:56:00,047
<i>Lowell was the birthplace of
the Industrial Revolution in America.</i>

849
00:56:00,189 --> 00:56:03,818
Industrial Revolution... Lowell.

850
00:56:04,661 --> 00:56:08,153
<i>I used to live over there.
This town got good memories, right?</i>

851
00:56:08,297 --> 00:56:10,265
<i>- Check it out.
- Fuck, yeah.</i>

852
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,130
<i>- This house here, this white house?
- Oh, yeah.</i>

853
00:56:13,269 --> 00:56:15,829
<i>White, big fat guy.
First time I got my crack, over here.</i>

854
00:56:15,972 --> 00:56:18,099
<i>Did you ever know that?
They smoke crack at the White House?</i>

855
00:56:19,575 --> 00:56:21,566
<i>White, black, Puerto Rican, everything.</i>

856
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:24,236
<i>The first time I did crack, or whatever,
I was about 23</i>

857
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:26,109
<i>and a friend of mine gave me
a gram, or whatever.</i>

858
00:56:26,249 --> 00:56:28,217
<i>Fuck, I wish that'd never happened.</i>

859
00:56:28,351 --> 00:56:31,843
<i>Before that, I'd been doing
the Silver Mittens and stuff.</i>

860
00:56:31,988 --> 00:56:35,549
<i>I was the only kid.
I'd be 12... I was shit-faced.</i>

861
00:56:35,692 --> 00:56:37,250
<i>I'll tell ya how crack works.</i>

862
00:56:39,429 --> 00:56:43,422
<i>When it enters your lungs...
When it enters your lungs...</i>

863
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:47,297
- I wanna watch, Daddy.
- Oh, my God. No, sweetie.

864
00:56:47,437 --> 00:56:50,600
- You go back upstairs.
- But I wanna watch Daddy on TV.

865
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:53,800
I know, baby. You can't watch
Daddy right now, all right?

866
00:56:53,943 --> 00:56:56,468
You go back upstairs
and go to bed, OK?

867
00:56:56,612 --> 00:56:58,739
<i>OK, yeah, there's my boys
right there. Check 'em out.</i>

868
00:56:58,881 --> 00:57:02,442
<i>- What kind of snake's that? Python?
- Yeah, check it out, man.</i>

869
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:04,883
<i>- It's not gonna bite me or something?
- He's cool.</i>

870
00:57:07,657 --> 00:57:10,023
<i>It's been a while.
I'll take anything right now.</i>

871
00:57:11,394 --> 00:57:13,259
I never thought
I'd kiss a fuckin' snake.

872
00:57:13,396 --> 00:57:14,761
I always dreamed about it...

873
00:57:17,066 --> 00:57:19,534
Do a lot of shit
when you're high, right?

874
00:57:22,205 --> 00:57:24,605
<i>Dicky... put Lowell on the map.</i>

875
00:57:24,741 --> 00:57:27,301
<i>He knocked Sugar Ray Leonard down.</i>

876
00:57:27,443 --> 00:57:32,278
<i>Yeah, he knocked him down,
but I don't think it was a knockdown.</i>

877
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:35,111
<i>- I think he slipped.
- He knocked him down.</i>

878
00:57:35,251 --> 00:57:37,617
<i>- He didn't slip.
- He slipped.</i>

879
00:57:37,754 --> 00:57:40,018
<i>- Oh... and you're from Lowell.
- Yeah, come on.</i>

880
00:57:40,156 --> 00:57:43,614
<i>- That's a fuckin' lie!
- They said he's in trouble with drugs.</i>

881
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,524
<i>What is this? Are you talking
shit about the family?</i>

882
00:57:46,662 --> 00:57:49,859
<i>- Oh, no, no, no...
- I heard you say "Dicky, Micky..."</i>

883
00:57:49,999 --> 00:57:52,058
<i>We're not like that.
This is not what Lowell is all about.</i>

884
00:57:52,201 --> 00:57:53,600
<i>I thought he could make a comeback</i>

885
00:57:53,736 --> 00:57:56,569
<i>- and make us proud, but he didn't.
- I don't know what Dicky was thinking.</i>

886
00:57:56,706 --> 00:57:58,833
<i>Very disappointing,
very disgusting.</i>

887
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:02,206
<i>You brought the city of
Lowell back 30 years. We're not happy.</i>

888
00:58:02,345 --> 00:58:04,142
<i>- Hello?
- Jimmy?</i>

889
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:06,908
Hey, will you do me a favor?
Make sure Kasie's not watching HBO?

890
00:58:07,049 --> 00:58:09,643
Actually, we're watching it right now,
Mick, but don't worry about it.

891
00:58:09,786 --> 00:58:11,481
I got it...

892
00:58:11,621 --> 00:58:14,749
I want her to see it.
Let her see who her uncle is.

893
00:58:14,891 --> 00:58:16,290
<i>- What?
- Who you are.</i>

894
00:58:16,425 --> 00:58:18,552
Who I am?
What are you talking about?

895
00:58:18,694 --> 00:58:21,959
<i>- Kids need to know the truth, Mick.
- Laurie, turn it off, please.</i>

896
00:58:22,098 --> 00:58:24,498
She does not need to see this.
She doesn't need to see it.

897
00:58:24,634 --> 00:58:26,033
She's a kid.

898
00:58:26,569 --> 00:58:30,096
<i>When you smoke crack, you know...</i>

899
00:58:30,239 --> 00:58:32,434
<i>... you feel so much lighter.</i>

900
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:35,806
<i>You know, you feel young, like when
everything was in front of you,</i>

901
00:58:35,945 --> 00:58:38,277
<i>everything was just...</i>

902
00:58:39,148 --> 00:58:42,481
<i>... everything was... just...</i>

903
00:58:42,618 --> 00:58:44,483
<i>... it was in front of you, you know?</i>

904
00:58:45,922 --> 00:58:48,288
<i>And then...</i>

905
00:58:48,424 --> 00:58:51,086
<i>... it fades and you
gotta get high again.</i>

906
00:58:56,399 --> 00:59:00,096
<i>Your part in the movie
is gonna end with you going to jail.</i>

907
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:06,001
<i>What about little Dicky?
Who's gonna take care of him, huh?</i>

908
00:59:09,278 --> 00:59:11,746
<i>You guys can't talk to 'em?</i>

909
00:59:12,949 --> 00:59:14,849
<i>Oh, man...</i>

910
00:59:14,984 --> 00:59:17,544
Turn this shit off.
Turn this off, all right?

911
00:59:17,687 --> 00:59:19,678
Turn it off. Will you turn this off?

912
00:59:19,822 --> 00:59:22,313
If you don't...
I'm turning it fuckin' off.

913
00:59:25,595 --> 00:59:27,290
Hey, hey, that is my life.

914
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:29,022
- My movie night!
- That's my fuckin' life out there.

915
00:59:29,165 --> 00:59:32,032
- I wanna watch this. I don't care.
- I will fuck you up!

916
00:59:32,168 --> 00:59:34,762
You fuckin' want some?
Don't fuckin' try me.

917
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:37,498
I still fuckin' got it, OK?

918
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:39,403
You fuckin' want some?!

919
00:59:39,542 --> 00:59:42,204
That's my son there,
and you're laughin' at him?!

920
00:59:43,846 --> 00:59:48,647
That's my son. He's crying. He needs me.
And I'm fuckin' stuck in here?

921
00:59:48,784 --> 00:59:51,810
<i>But you know what?
Dicky was a street kid.</i>

922
00:59:51,954 --> 00:59:56,152
Micky, you watching this?
What are they doing to us?

923
00:59:57,860 --> 01:00:01,227
Ma, I don't know what to tell you.

924
01:00:01,364 --> 01:00:03,298
You're pretending like you
don't know what's going on.

925
01:00:03,432 --> 01:00:05,366
He's been doing this for years.

926
01:00:06,602 --> 01:00:09,628
Yeah, I know it's horrible, Ma, but...

927
01:00:13,676 --> 01:00:16,668
<i>- What do you think?
- You think they set him up?</i>

928
01:00:16,812 --> 01:00:18,905
What do you think he was doing?

929
01:00:19,048 --> 01:00:22,449
<i>You know, gave him money,
gave him drugs for the movie. Right?</i>

930
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:29,417
<i>Micky... Micky?</i>

931
01:00:30,326 --> 01:00:31,987
<i>Shit. Micky...</i>

932
01:02:47,897 --> 01:02:49,956
- You got a new bag, huh?
- Yup.

933
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:52,329
- New bracket, too?
- Yup.

934
01:02:52,468 --> 01:02:55,164
- What happened to the peanut?
- I don't know.

935
01:02:56,072 --> 01:02:57,630
It's like a beach ball.

936
01:04:25,661 --> 01:04:28,824
- Mick. Sal Lonano.
- Hey, Mick, how you doing?

937
01:04:28,964 --> 01:04:30,522
You own a cab company,
you're a good businessman, right?

938
01:04:30,666 --> 01:04:33,601
- Yeah, he's very organized.
- How's the hand?

939
01:04:33,736 --> 01:04:36,762
It's good. You know,
it's getting better. Stronger.

940
01:04:36,906 --> 01:04:40,672
Yeah, you know, I made a few calls
already. I talked to Buddy Tags.

941
01:04:40,809 --> 01:04:44,540
Said he can set up something local,
something to start back with.

942
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:46,614
- Get your confidence back.
- That's it.

943
01:04:46,749 --> 01:04:48,614
You gotta get your confidence back.
That's all.

944
01:04:51,053 --> 01:04:55,319
Your dad wants Sal to manage ya,
and he wants me to train ya.

945
01:04:55,457 --> 01:04:57,925
But I'll only do it on one condition.

946
01:04:59,929 --> 01:05:03,990
- No crazy-time nonsense.
- It's how it's gotta be.

947
01:05:04,133 --> 01:05:07,398
- No Dicky. No Alice.
- No Dicky. No Alice.

948
01:05:07,536 --> 01:05:10,198
I get it, I get it.
I'm good, I understand.

949
01:05:10,339 --> 01:05:12,637
- Look, I appreciate the opportunity.
- I can't take the bullshit, Mick.

950
01:05:12,775 --> 01:05:15,642
- No offense, Georgie.
- None taken.

951
01:05:15,778 --> 01:05:19,043
I'm gonna be the one who gets
his balls cut off, anyway.

952
01:05:20,182 --> 01:05:22,810
<i>- Yeah. You laugh.
- You...</i>

953
01:05:22,952 --> 01:05:26,149
...fuckin' traitor!
- What are you doing?

954
01:05:26,789 --> 01:05:31,226
What the hell's the matter with you?!
Come on! The pans hurt!

955
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:32,691
Do they hurt?! I hope it hurts!

956
01:05:32,828 --> 01:05:35,160
- Sal Lonano is a good man!
- A good man?!

957
01:05:35,297 --> 01:05:37,561
He's a legitimate businessman,
for Chrissakes!

958
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:39,827
- Legitimate businessman?
- Yes. What?

959
01:05:39,969 --> 01:05:41,596
Oh, my God,
you know what that sounds like?

960
01:05:41,737 --> 01:05:44,399
- He's a crook, George!
- He owns a taxi cab company!

961
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:46,906
- He's organized!
- Oh, my God. He's a cab driver.

962
01:05:47,042 --> 01:05:48,509
He knows everything
about boxing, right?

963
01:05:48,644 --> 01:05:52,808
I don't think so! He's gonna steal
your son's money and rob him blind!

964
01:05:52,948 --> 01:05:55,473
Why would you think that?
Why would you even think that?

965
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:58,178
- Why can't you trust anybody with?
- I know people.

966
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:00,948
I know, George, you think I don't
know anything, but I know people.

967
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:03,058
- I know you know people.
- And that Sal Lonano

968
01:06:03,192 --> 01:06:06,855
banana fucking thing,
we don't need that in our lives!

969
01:06:06,996 --> 01:06:08,861
We haven't made one dollar
with these kids!

970
01:06:08,998 --> 01:06:11,592
- You betrayed me!
- Oh, bullshit, I betrayed you.

971
01:06:11,734 --> 01:06:13,895
- You always react the same way.
- He's a fuckin' crook!

972
01:06:14,036 --> 01:06:16,732
What's Micky supposed to do?
Dicky's in jail!

973
01:06:16,872 --> 01:06:19,670
We're not talking about his trainer,
sweetheart!

974
01:06:19,808 --> 01:06:22,971
We're talking about his manager,
that's me!

975
01:06:23,112 --> 01:06:25,307
But, Mom, maybe Micky
should try something different!

976
01:06:25,447 --> 01:06:27,438
What are you doing opening
your mouth in my kitchen?

977
01:06:27,583 --> 01:06:31,383
- You owe me $200.
- I said I was gonna pay you next week.

978
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:33,181
I don't want
another word outta you.

979
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:34,914
That was last month
you told me two weeks.

980
01:06:35,057 --> 01:06:38,322
You take sides against me in
my own house, you owe me money?

981
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:40,087
And Ma's been great
to Micky, Sherri.

982
01:06:40,229 --> 01:06:43,198
Really, I mean, who's gonna look out
for Micky better than his own mother?

983
01:06:43,332 --> 01:06:46,130
It's that fuckin' girl, Charlene.
We gotta get rid of her.

984
01:06:46,268 --> 01:06:49,203
Ma, we gotta get rid of her.
It's that girl, Charlene. She gotta go.

985
01:06:49,338 --> 01:06:50,737
<i>You're gonna get Charlene involved?</i>

986
01:06:50,873 --> 01:06:54,434
<i>- Is that what you're telling me?
- I know where she lives.</i>

987
01:06:54,576 --> 01:06:56,043
<i>What are you pickin' on her for?</i>

988
01:06:56,178 --> 01:06:59,079
<i>She lives in that
yellow house on Stevens Street.</i>

989
01:06:59,214 --> 01:07:01,705
<i>I'm gonna go talk to Micky,
sort this out for myself.</i>

990
01:07:01,850 --> 01:07:06,947
<i>Yeah, sure. You go handle it
with your vigilantes. All of yous now.</i>

991
01:07:07,089 --> 01:07:08,181
<i>This is wrong, Alice!</i>

992
01:07:15,731 --> 01:07:17,062
I got it!

993
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:18,996
Get outta my way! Get in the car!

994
01:07:19,635 --> 01:07:21,500
Come on, come on, come on, come on!

995
01:07:22,271 --> 01:07:24,102
Get in the car.

996
01:07:47,363 --> 01:07:49,729
- Yeah, they're in there!
- Up there on the second floor.

997
01:07:49,865 --> 01:07:51,355
Micky!

998
01:07:52,267 --> 01:07:56,067
Where the hell are you?
You up there? Come on down!

999
01:07:56,205 --> 01:07:57,729
Where are you?

1000
01:07:58,774 --> 01:08:01,743
Holy shit, Micky, your mother
and your sisters are here.

1001
01:08:01,877 --> 01:08:04,903
No, don't.
Do not go out there. Please.

1002
01:08:05,047 --> 01:08:08,642
No, I'm not hiding from
your crazy fuckin' family.

1003
01:08:20,195 --> 01:08:21,423
Hi.

1004
01:08:21,563 --> 01:08:23,292
Well, well, well.
Look at this.

1005
01:08:23,432 --> 01:08:24,558
Look at what?

1006
01:08:25,534 --> 01:08:28,765
- Why you hiding from us, Micky?
- He's not hiding.

1007
01:08:28,904 --> 01:08:31,429
Wasn't talking to you.
I was talking to my son.

1008
01:08:31,573 --> 01:08:33,006
What are you doing, Mickster?

1009
01:08:33,142 --> 01:08:35,542
I'm right here.
I ain't hiding from nobody, Alice.

1010
01:08:35,677 --> 01:08:39,340
You're not helping yourself with
your father's scumbag friend Lonano.

1011
01:08:39,481 --> 01:08:41,881
What are you gonna do,
turn your back on Dicky next?

1012
01:08:43,585 --> 01:08:46,281
All we ever wanted for you
was to be world champion.

1013
01:08:46,422 --> 01:08:48,982
Micky's a grown man.
He can think for himself.

1014
01:08:49,124 --> 01:08:51,524
- Shut your mouth.
- Skank.

1015
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:55,255
Don't call me skank. I'll rip that nasty
hair right out of your fuckin' head.

1016
01:08:55,397 --> 01:08:57,797
I'm his mother. And his manager.

1017
01:08:57,933 --> 01:09:00,231
You're not my manager anymore.
And I'm not waiting for Dicky, OK?

1018
01:09:00,369 --> 01:09:02,166
I'm not gettin' any younger.

1019
01:09:02,304 --> 01:09:04,238
Who's gonna look after you, sweetheart?

1020
01:09:04,373 --> 01:09:07,865
I mean, come on. I know you don't
understand it, but I had nine kids

1021
01:09:08,010 --> 01:09:11,411
- and I love every one of you the same.
- You got a funny way of showing it,

1022
01:09:11,547 --> 01:09:13,412
letting him get beat up,
letting him get his hand broken.

1023
01:09:13,549 --> 01:09:16,313
- You're crazy.
- You fuckin' bar skank!

1024
01:09:16,452 --> 01:09:18,977
- What did I just say to you?
- Don't put your hands on her...

1025
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:26,227
- Get off of me!
- Stop it!

1026
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:30,662
Let her go!
Let her go!

1027
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:34,761
- Fuck you, Charlene!
- Fuck you!

1028
01:09:34,903 --> 01:09:38,737
- Get the fuck outta here! Now!
- Fuck you, Charlene!

1029
01:09:38,874 --> 01:09:40,774
- Skank!
- Micky...

1030
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:46,546
- Fuckin' bitch!
- Oh, my God! Gail!

1031
01:09:46,682 --> 01:09:48,775
What'd she do to your nose?

1032
01:09:56,425 --> 01:09:58,620
What is happenin'?
What is happenin' to everybody?

1033
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:01,058
I don't understand, sweetheart.

1034
01:10:46,141 --> 01:10:50,009
Why... Why do you think
I spell my name with an E?

1035
01:10:50,145 --> 01:10:51,612
'Cause I don't.

1036
01:10:51,747 --> 01:10:54,045
- No-E Micky Ward.
- Hey, somebody push the button.

1037
01:10:55,817 --> 01:10:58,411
- Where we going? What's with the ring?
- Ring's across the street.

1038
01:10:58,554 --> 01:11:00,579
- The ring's across the street?
- Yeah.

1039
01:11:00,722 --> 01:11:03,282
Yeah, smaller venue.
They got no dressin' rooms over there.

1040
01:11:03,425 --> 01:11:07,418
- Yeah, but...
- Micky, It's just a start. Don't worry.

1041
01:11:09,798 --> 01:11:12,858
Hey. Good luck.

1042
01:11:24,746 --> 01:11:26,145
That's it!

1043
01:11:29,151 --> 01:11:32,143
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

1044
01:12:58,407 --> 01:13:00,534
<i>Visit for Dick Eklund.</i>

1045
01:13:00,676 --> 01:13:01,904
Dicky!

1046
01:13:02,044 --> 01:13:04,410
Eklund, you got a visitor!

1047
01:13:05,614 --> 01:13:09,710
Heard you won a bunch of fights, Mick.
That's good.

1048
01:13:09,851 --> 01:13:11,751
I know you know what I been doing.

1049
01:13:11,887 --> 01:13:14,617
I'm sure Alice
and everybody else told you.

1050
01:13:14,756 --> 01:13:17,384
I just wanted to tell you
to your face myself.

1051
01:13:17,526 --> 01:13:20,962
I got new management.
Mickey O'Keefe's my trainer now.

1052
01:13:21,096 --> 01:13:23,087
It's all good.

1053
01:13:23,231 --> 01:13:26,530
Yeah. They got you fightin'
Alfonso Sanchez.

1054
01:13:26,668 --> 01:13:28,260
- On HBO.
- And you're proud of that?

1055
01:13:28,403 --> 01:13:32,362
- Fuckin' right.
- HBO is invested in the Mexican.

1056
01:13:32,507 --> 01:13:34,441
I didn't think they were gonna be
invested in me?

1057
01:13:35,610 --> 01:13:37,942
- I got a shot. I'm gonna take it.
- Wake up.

1058
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:40,173
They don't care if he kills you.

1059
01:13:40,315 --> 01:13:44,843
Mike Toma did it. He's using you,
like a stepping-stone for Sanchez.

1060
01:13:46,922 --> 01:13:49,686
- Why don't you see?
- Oh, I see.

1061
01:13:49,825 --> 01:13:53,352
How could I stand a chance without the
great Dick Eklund in my corner, right?

1062
01:13:53,495 --> 01:13:55,793
You didn't give a fuck
if I got killed by Mungin.

1063
01:13:55,931 --> 01:13:59,662
Now all of a sudden you're worried
Sanchez is gonna hurt me? Why?

1064
01:13:59,801 --> 01:14:02,770
'Cause you're stuck in here and can't
be the center of attention no more?

1065
01:14:02,904 --> 01:14:04,701
- You need it that bad?
- I've seen this Mexican fight.

1066
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:07,638
He fights, hits,
like a fuckin' mule, all right?

1067
01:14:07,776 --> 01:14:10,074
Fifteen knockouts, undefeated.
You crazy?

1068
01:14:10,212 --> 01:14:12,703
And that taxi cab idiot,
Lonano, he went right for it.

1069
01:14:12,848 --> 01:14:15,476
He's a paper gangster,
he's using you to steal money.

1070
01:14:15,617 --> 01:14:18,984
Why can't you just shut up
and be happy for me?

1071
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:22,386
I spent the last ten years of my life
in bad fights set up by you and Alice.

1072
01:14:22,524 --> 01:14:24,253
I finally got a good thing going for me

1073
01:14:24,392 --> 01:14:27,122
and you can't be fuckin'
happy for me? Why?

1074
01:14:28,163 --> 01:14:30,393
What's your plan?
How you gonna fight Sanchez?

1075
01:14:30,532 --> 01:14:34,127
- I ain't here to talk about that.
- What's your plan?

1076
01:14:34,269 --> 01:14:36,829
- I am not here to talk about that.
- What's your plan?

1077
01:14:36,972 --> 01:14:38,963
Yes, you are.

1078
01:14:39,107 --> 01:14:41,166
You watch the fight
and you'll see the plan.

1079
01:14:41,309 --> 01:14:44,540
I can't watch it. They don't let us.
It's too fuckin' violent. I mean...

1080
01:14:44,679 --> 01:14:46,112
Two minutes, Dicky.

1081
01:14:46,248 --> 01:14:48,614
They'll let us watch a stupid
documentary about crack,

1082
01:14:48,750 --> 01:14:52,516
but I can't watch my own
brother fighting, you know?

1083
01:14:52,654 --> 01:14:56,454
Hey... Mick, what is it?

1084
01:14:56,591 --> 01:14:58,923
You scared? You embarrassed
because you don't even have a plan?

1085
01:14:59,060 --> 01:15:01,085
I'm your brother. Just tell me.

1086
01:15:01,229 --> 01:15:02,856
Are you gonna shit on it
no matter what I say?

1087
01:15:02,998 --> 01:15:04,863
I'm not gonna shit on it. Just tell me.

1088
01:15:07,969 --> 01:15:10,096
Go toe-to-toe.
Overhand right in the middle rounds.

1089
01:15:10,238 --> 01:15:12,331
He's weak against the overhand right.

1090
01:15:13,542 --> 01:15:15,874
Who came up with that?
Fatty fuck O'Keefe?

1091
01:15:16,011 --> 01:15:17,035
Fuck you, Dicky.

1092
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:20,341
You gotta run against this guy.
Let him punch himself out.

1093
01:15:20,482 --> 01:15:22,541
Take him to the body, right? Get inside.

1094
01:15:22,684 --> 01:15:25,448
Switch stances like you're gonna
work his right, hit him on the left.

1095
01:15:25,587 --> 01:15:27,521
You ain't me. All right?
You can't be me.

1096
01:15:27,656 --> 01:15:29,283
- Careful. Switch outside...
- You had a hard enough time

1097
01:15:29,424 --> 01:15:31,119
being you when you had
your fuckin' chance,

1098
01:15:31,259 --> 01:15:34,717
and that's why you're in here.
I'll fight Sanchez the way I fight.

1099
01:15:34,863 --> 01:15:37,423
I'm talking about the way
you fight, you moron!

1100
01:15:38,834 --> 01:15:41,667
Yeah, you know I'm right!
He knows I'm right. All right.

1101
01:15:45,140 --> 01:15:46,573
He knows I'm right.

1102
01:15:50,111 --> 01:15:55,549
<i>Ward's record: 29 wins,
seven losses so far, 20 KOs.</i>

1103
01:15:55,684 --> 01:15:59,017
<i>He's been a little better since
he refocused himself on the sport,</i>

1104
01:15:59,154 --> 01:16:00,678
<i>as JB pointed out.</i>

1105
01:16:06,228 --> 01:16:10,722
Now, here's Ward's opponent,
Alfonso Sanchez, out of Tijuana, Mexico.

1106
01:16:10,866 --> 01:16:15,997
<i>You see the record: 16 wins,
15 KOs, eight first-round KOs.</i>

1107
01:16:16,137 --> 01:16:17,900
<i>There's Mike Toma,
the promoter of the fight,</i>

1108
01:16:18,039 --> 01:16:19,666
<i>who has a lot invested in Sanchez.</i>

1109
01:16:19,808 --> 01:16:21,435
And he says that Sanchez is

1110
01:16:21,576 --> 01:16:25,876
one of the most talented young
prospects in the sport of boxing.

1111
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:40,084
This is really one of
the saddest kinds of fights in boxing.

1112
01:16:40,228 --> 01:16:42,924
- Get out of the corner!
- Micky Ward is 31 years old,

1113
01:16:43,064 --> 01:16:46,090
he's here because he needs the money,
he's taking a beating...

1114
01:16:46,234 --> 01:16:48,498
And my point is
that he doesn't really have to sit here

1115
01:16:48,637 --> 01:16:51,299
and take this beating.
He can do something about it.

1116
01:16:51,439 --> 01:16:53,532
Which is what?
Have his corner throw in the towel?

1117
01:16:53,675 --> 01:16:55,700
- Or fight back.
- Get back.

1118
01:16:58,079 --> 01:16:59,068
You can see his power.

1119
01:16:59,214 --> 01:17:01,273
Every time he hits Ward,
he backs him up.

1120
01:17:01,416 --> 01:17:03,350
How about taking points away from him?

1121
01:17:04,419 --> 01:17:06,319
<i>Larry, unless
the referee does, you can't.</i>

1122
01:17:06,454 --> 01:17:07,978
<i>The referee should just go
ahead and stop this fight.</i>

1123
01:17:08,123 --> 01:17:11,650
<i>He knows that Micky doesn't want
to be here. I wouldn't even make...</i>

1124
01:17:11,793 --> 01:17:13,886
He's fightin' scared, Dick.

1125
01:17:14,029 --> 01:17:16,122
Runnin' away, not hittin' back.

1126
01:17:16,264 --> 01:17:19,893
<i>Oh, Jesus. He's gonna get hurt.</i>

1127
01:17:20,035 --> 01:17:22,026
<i>Doing that same old shit.</i>

1128
01:17:22,170 --> 01:17:24,502
<i>They never seen such
an embarrassing performance.</i>

1129
01:17:24,639 --> 01:17:26,732
He's doing what I told him, Ma.
He's doing what I told him.

1130
01:17:26,875 --> 01:17:28,570
Don't worry about it.
He's doing what I told him.

1131
01:17:28,710 --> 01:17:31,577
Micky Ward, showing nothing
but respect.

1132
01:17:31,713 --> 01:17:33,305
What are you runnin' around for?
Stop running around!

1133
01:17:33,448 --> 01:17:36,508
Shut the fuck up, Sal!
Shut the fuck up!

1134
01:17:36,651 --> 01:17:39,017
I don't know what you're doing, Micky.
Want to fuckin' tell me?

1135
01:17:39,154 --> 01:17:40,382
'Cause I don't know what you're doing.

1136
01:17:40,522 --> 01:17:43,047
We have lost all five rounds,
is that what you want?

1137
01:17:43,191 --> 01:17:45,523
Dreadful.
This is dreadful, dreadful stuff.

1138
01:17:45,660 --> 01:17:48,288
You gotta show me something soon,
Mick, or I'm gonna stop the fight.

1139
01:17:48,430 --> 01:17:49,556
Now they're gonna stop the fight, Micky.

1140
01:17:49,698 --> 01:17:51,632
He's gotta go inside, Ma.

1141
01:17:51,766 --> 01:17:53,927
He's gotta take it to the body.
He's gotta.

1142
01:17:54,069 --> 01:17:55,297
Come on, get your punches up...

1143
01:17:55,437 --> 01:17:57,667
- Don't stop the fight.
- They're gonna stop this fight.

1144
01:17:57,806 --> 01:18:00,001
Then you gotta do something, baby.

1145
01:18:00,141 --> 01:18:01,802
That's not what we talked about, Micky.

1146
01:18:01,943 --> 01:18:05,003
We had a plan and you're
not doing it. Now, let's go.

1147
01:18:05,146 --> 01:18:06,204
All right, Micky.

1148
01:18:06,348 --> 01:18:10,284
You've lost the first five rounds.
What's the next strategy gonna be?

1149
01:18:10,418 --> 01:18:14,184
Double right hand by Sanchez,
then a triple left hook.

1150
01:18:14,322 --> 01:18:17,314
A couple of the left hooks landed
flush on the cheek of Micky Ward.

1151
01:18:17,459 --> 01:18:19,757
Ward tying Sanchez up.

1152
01:18:19,894 --> 01:18:21,725
Very curious performance
by Micky Ward.

1153
01:18:21,863 --> 01:18:23,194
Come on, Micky, come on!

1154
01:18:23,331 --> 01:18:26,164
Ward seems...
trying to land one big shot

1155
01:18:26,301 --> 01:18:28,565
to change Sanchez's mind...

1156
01:18:28,703 --> 01:18:30,398
And he's beginning to open up.

1157
01:18:30,538 --> 01:18:33,098
Taking advantage of more and more
opportunities to get close to Ward

1158
01:18:33,241 --> 01:18:34,708
and throw against a fighter...

1159
01:18:34,843 --> 01:18:35,867
Time!

1160
01:18:36,011 --> 01:18:38,343
...who's not defending himself
by punching.

1161
01:18:39,114 --> 01:18:41,446
Sanchez is gonna try
to end this fight.

1162
01:18:48,023 --> 01:18:49,888
- What are you doing? Come on!
- That's it.

1163
01:18:50,925 --> 01:18:52,290
Good boy!

1164
01:18:53,661 --> 01:18:54,923
He's down on an uppercut!

1165
01:18:59,134 --> 01:19:02,626
- Nicely thrown left uppercut inside.
...three, four, five...

1166
01:19:02,771 --> 01:19:06,036
And right after Ward threw
a pretty good right hand.

1167
01:19:06,174 --> 01:19:09,143
Mick, you all right?
Come to me. Come to me.

1168
01:19:09,277 --> 01:19:11,177
This is a fight
that should be stopped.

1169
01:19:12,547 --> 01:19:14,071
Come on, head, body, head.

1170
01:19:16,918 --> 01:19:18,408
This is not professional.

1171
01:19:18,553 --> 01:19:20,316
That's exactly what I'm saying.

1172
01:19:20,455 --> 01:19:23,481
- Punch him! You gotta punch!
- Someone should pay me to watch this.

1173
01:19:23,625 --> 01:19:26,617
Come on, man! Head, body, head!

1174
01:19:28,363 --> 01:19:29,660
That was a good body shot by Ward.

1175
01:19:29,798 --> 01:19:32,289
That was good.
Maybe it'll turn him around.

1176
01:19:32,434 --> 01:19:34,595
Maybe. I'm talking about if I...

1177
01:19:35,937 --> 01:19:38,838
Sanchez drops
like he's shot! Oh, my God!

1178
01:19:38,973 --> 01:19:43,069
The most unlikely
knockout you have ever seen.

1179
01:19:43,211 --> 01:19:46,112
That was a kidney shot,
the kind of kidney shot...

1180
01:19:46,247 --> 01:19:48,147
...nine, ten!

1181
01:19:50,752 --> 01:19:53,050
I still don't believe
what I just saw.

1182
01:19:56,991 --> 01:19:59,186
Oh, Micky won!

1183
01:20:01,763 --> 01:20:04,129
Now, did Micky Ward
just make idiots of us all

1184
01:20:04,265 --> 01:20:08,292
with a spectacular piece of strategy?
Take another look. Amazing.

1185
01:20:08,436 --> 01:20:11,064
<i>A brilliant win in the career
of Micky Ward out of Lowell, Mass.</i>

1186
01:20:11,206 --> 01:20:14,505
<i>Unbelievable defeat
at the hands of Micky Ward,</i>

1187
01:20:14,642 --> 01:20:19,079
<i>who had all but given away the first
half-dozen rounds of the bout.</i>

1188
01:20:19,214 --> 01:20:21,341
I think what Micky did was he recognized

1189
01:20:21,483 --> 01:20:23,280
that he'd hurt the guy
with the body shot.

1190
01:20:23,418 --> 01:20:26,216
Micky's a better fighter than that to
not be runnin' from that guy like that.

1191
01:20:26,354 --> 01:20:28,345
Theater of the unexpected.

1192
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:30,856
Hey, you never know
what can happen, right?

1193
01:20:30,992 --> 01:20:32,459
Never give up in this game, right?
Never give up.

1194
01:20:33,461 --> 01:20:35,053
You can't make it up, folks.

1195
01:20:35,196 --> 01:20:36,686
You hear what he said?

1196
01:20:36,831 --> 01:20:38,526
He said, "You can't give up
in this game."

1197
01:20:38,666 --> 01:20:41,601
Well, maybe Micky Ward
heard me say you should stop this fight

1198
01:20:41,736 --> 01:20:43,465
and he went out and stopped it.

1199
01:20:44,139 --> 01:20:46,801
- Right there. Right there.
- Yeah! I can't believe it.

1200
01:20:46,941 --> 01:20:49,808
I'm lookin' over, and I'm thinkin'
to myself like they were thinkin':

1201
01:20:49,944 --> 01:20:51,172
This thing is over.

1202
01:20:51,312 --> 01:20:53,246
But I tell you what, if you
looked at the commentators,

1203
01:20:53,381 --> 01:20:56,009
they started to take their headsets off
before he was even counted out.

1204
01:20:56,151 --> 01:20:57,516
They just wanted to get out of there.

1205
01:20:57,652 --> 01:21:00,348
Mick, Mick.
I just spoke to Mike Toma.

1206
01:21:00,488 --> 01:21:02,854
- He told me something very interesting.
- Holy shit, what?

1207
01:21:02,991 --> 01:21:04,356
He just told me,

1208
01:21:04,492 --> 01:21:07,052
had Sanchez won tonight,
he would've gotten the title shot.

1209
01:21:07,195 --> 01:21:10,289
- Holy Christ, that's beautiful.
- Why? Why is that beautiful?

1210
01:21:10,431 --> 01:21:15,027
- A title shot. Mick gets the shot.
- Micky gets the shot!

1211
01:21:15,170 --> 01:21:18,571
- Are you kidding me?
- Are you sure about that?

1212
01:21:18,706 --> 01:21:21,937
I just spoke to the guy. Mike!
Come here, Mike. Look, tell these guys.

1213
01:21:22,076 --> 01:21:23,873
- Hey, Mike Toma. Thank you.
- Congratulations.

1214
01:21:24,012 --> 01:21:27,106
You're not a stepping stone anymore.
I always knew you had the talent.

1215
01:21:27,248 --> 01:21:30,081
That was a hell of a strategy, wearing
him down and taking it to the body.

1216
01:21:30,218 --> 01:21:33,187
Thirty years in the business,
I'd never seen a knockout like that.

1217
01:21:33,321 --> 01:21:34,811
Larry Merchant was writing
your obituary,

1218
01:21:34,956 --> 01:21:36,253
and Sanchez drops
like he's shot with a gun.

1219
01:21:36,391 --> 01:21:38,154
Where'd you get that?

1220
01:21:38,293 --> 01:21:39,658
That's the first thing
my brother taught me.

1221
01:21:39,794 --> 01:21:41,227
Tap 'em to the head,
ding 'em to the body.

1222
01:21:41,362 --> 01:21:43,387
- That's a hell of a body shot.
- Thank you.

1223
01:21:43,531 --> 01:21:46,591
- You ready for a title shot?
- I ain't gettin' no younger.

1224
01:21:47,235 --> 01:21:49,567
Thanks, Mr. Toma. Thank you.

1225
01:21:49,704 --> 01:21:51,604
He's ready. You're ready, aren't ya?

1226
01:21:52,574 --> 01:21:55,202
Shea Neary in London
for the title.

1227
01:21:55,343 --> 01:21:57,277
Are you kidding,
we got some celebrating to do.

1228
01:21:57,412 --> 01:21:58,811
- Yeah, I think so.
- Thank you so much.

1229
01:21:58,947 --> 01:22:01,438
- Gonna have a great champ in my boy.
- Thank you, Mr. Toma.

1230
01:22:04,018 --> 01:22:06,009
It's what your brother
would've always wanted.

1231
01:22:06,154 --> 01:22:07,883
He's not even gonna be there.

1232
01:22:33,948 --> 01:22:37,008
- Hey!
- Daddy!

1233
01:22:37,151 --> 01:22:39,176
- Come here, buddy.
- Daddy, Daddy!

1234
01:22:40,288 --> 01:22:42,449
Good to see you!

1235
01:22:43,891 --> 01:22:48,157
That's a good hug!
That's a good hug! Yeah!

1236
01:22:48,296 --> 01:22:50,628
- Sweetheart.
- Hey, Ma.

1237
01:22:50,765 --> 01:22:55,327
Oh, you look so good. Oh, my God.

1238
01:23:02,777 --> 01:23:05,575
- You have clean teeth.
- I do! Look at my teeth!

1239
01:23:06,381 --> 01:23:08,315
I got new teeth. Everything.

1240
01:23:08,449 --> 01:23:09,780
How you think I look?

1241
01:23:09,917 --> 01:23:12,044
- Good.
- Yeah?

1242
01:23:24,899 --> 01:23:27,026
Cake and more cake.

1243
01:23:27,168 --> 01:23:29,762
- Ice cream?
- Ice cream and cake.

1244
01:23:29,904 --> 01:23:32,498
Ice cream and cake and cake. Right?

1245
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:35,803
Ice cream, cake and cake.
Ice cream, cake and cake...

1246
01:23:35,943 --> 01:23:37,501
Quacka!

1247
01:23:42,684 --> 01:23:44,174
Ma.

1248
01:23:57,131 --> 01:24:00,157
- They gave you some new teeth, huh?
- Yeah.

1249
01:24:04,572 --> 01:24:06,904
Hey, Georgie. What, they let
you outta the house now?

1250
01:24:07,041 --> 01:24:09,566
- Yeah.
- Lettin' him outta the house, Ma?

1251
01:24:09,711 --> 01:24:11,736
Hey, look, I want you
to meet Sal Lonano.

1252
01:24:18,586 --> 01:24:20,554
How you doing, Dicky?

1253
01:24:22,590 --> 01:24:24,057
Let's spar.

1254
01:24:32,266 --> 01:24:33,733
Hey, Charlene.

1255
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:00,621
Welcome back!

1256
01:25:00,762 --> 01:25:03,424
It's supposed to be a surprise.
You're late.

1257
01:25:04,532 --> 01:25:06,762
- Hey.
- Hey.

1258
01:25:06,901 --> 01:25:10,393
Mick, I can't even tell you, being in
this smelly-ass locker room. You know?

1259
01:25:10,538 --> 01:25:13,200
Being back with you,
this is what got me through.

1260
01:25:13,341 --> 01:25:17,710
- You look good. Your eyes are clear.
- Yeah. You know...

1261
01:25:18,913 --> 01:25:21,643
...Alice says prison might've
been the best thing for me.

1262
01:25:21,783 --> 01:25:25,184
Got me clean. Got me clear. Up here.

1263
01:25:26,287 --> 01:25:28,255
It's a beautiful thing, Dick.

1264
01:25:29,991 --> 01:25:33,825
- I gotta talk to you about something.
- Yeah.

1265
01:25:33,961 --> 01:25:37,453
Look at this locker.
The old locker.

1266
01:25:37,598 --> 01:25:39,225
I love it. Fuckin' love it.

1267
01:25:41,269 --> 01:25:44,727
I made a promise to them
I wouldn't work with you again.

1268
01:25:54,582 --> 01:25:58,313
I had to. After everything
that happened, I'm sorry.

1269
01:26:03,257 --> 01:26:05,623
You stickin' to that?

1270
01:26:07,061 --> 01:26:11,657
I'm glad you're back. You look good.

1271
01:26:11,799 --> 01:26:15,030
I don't know what else to say.

1272
01:26:22,009 --> 01:26:24,307
- Mick, you fuckin' kidding me?
- No, I'm not.

1273
01:26:29,083 --> 01:26:32,052
- Oh, hey, Mick.
- Come on, come on!

1274
01:26:32,186 --> 01:26:36,282
You gotta... Ma. You gotta
do this at home. Please?

1275
01:26:36,424 --> 01:26:38,119
What are you talkin' about?
What's the matter?

1276
01:26:38,259 --> 01:26:40,318
Mom, please?

1277
01:26:40,461 --> 01:26:42,793
All right, girls. Let's pack it up.

1278
01:26:42,930 --> 01:26:44,363
I know. We'll see him at home.

1279
01:27:06,687 --> 01:27:09,053
- What the hell?
- Would you please pack it up?

1280
01:27:09,190 --> 01:27:10,589
- Why?
- Let's get it put away.

1281
01:27:11,359 --> 01:27:14,192
If that's what Micky wants,
we're gonna put it away.

1282
01:27:14,328 --> 01:27:16,558
- There's your brother.
- Dicky...

1283
01:27:16,697 --> 01:27:19,894
- How ya doing?
- Micky?

1284
01:27:24,572 --> 01:27:27,063
That's nice. That's nice.

1285
01:27:27,208 --> 01:27:28,675
We've been working on it
for two weeks.

1286
01:27:28,809 --> 01:27:30,743
Sherri, come on, stop it.

1287
01:27:30,878 --> 01:27:32,345
All right, girls,
come on, let's go home.

1288
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:34,846
It's not the time to do this,
obviously. Come on.

1289
01:27:34,982 --> 01:27:39,248
You stay here.
What the hell's going on?

1290
01:27:39,387 --> 01:27:41,878
- What's going on?
- We ain't gonna work together.

1291
01:27:42,924 --> 01:27:44,687
He don't want me to work with him.

1292
01:27:44,825 --> 01:27:46,918
What're you talking about?

1293
01:27:47,061 --> 01:27:49,120
That's not right.

1294
01:27:49,263 --> 01:27:52,755
Micky never would've won
Sanchez without Dicky.

1295
01:27:52,900 --> 01:27:55,130
That's fuckin' bullshit! Take it back!

1296
01:27:55,269 --> 01:27:57,635
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Don't you fuckin'
talk to my mother that way.

1297
01:27:57,772 --> 01:27:58,761
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

1298
01:27:58,906 --> 01:28:00,498
Take 'em home.

1299
01:28:02,543 --> 01:28:03,976
Why don't you ask Micky?

1300
01:28:04,912 --> 01:28:07,176
If we're gonna train, they gotta go.

1301
01:28:07,315 --> 01:28:09,249
They gotta go, Mick, come on.

1302
01:28:10,251 --> 01:28:13,948
Ask him, George. Ask him if he would've
won Sanchez without his brother?

1303
01:28:14,088 --> 01:28:15,749
Hey, take him outside, all right?

1304
01:28:17,959 --> 01:28:20,291
No, I wouldn't have won Sanchez
if it wasn't for Dicky.

1305
01:28:21,429 --> 01:28:22,623
How can you say that to O'Keefe?

1306
01:28:22,763 --> 01:28:24,253
Because it's true.

1307
01:28:25,099 --> 01:28:26,862
I went with that game plan,
it wasn't working.

1308
01:28:27,001 --> 01:28:29,026
So I went back to what
I learned with Dicky.

1309
01:28:29,170 --> 01:28:32,071
And I wouldn't have won without you,
either, O'Keefe, OK?

1310
01:28:32,907 --> 01:28:35,774
I mean, you know that.
We worked hard. You got me ready.

1311
01:28:35,910 --> 01:28:38,401
You got your confidence
and your focus from O'Keefe,

1312
01:28:38,546 --> 01:28:41,777
and from Sal and
your father and from me.

1313
01:28:43,351 --> 01:28:45,546
- Dicky's a junk bag.
- Hey.

1314
01:28:45,686 --> 01:28:46,846
He's a junk bag!

1315
01:28:46,988 --> 01:28:48,580
- Fuck you, Charlene.
- Fuck you.

1316
01:28:48,723 --> 01:28:50,156
- I'm eight months sober.
- Oh, yeah,

1317
01:28:50,291 --> 01:28:52,088
and I'm sure you're gonna need
something now that you're out.

1318
01:28:52,226 --> 01:28:54,023
"Oh, my back. Oh, my back."

1319
01:28:54,161 --> 01:28:56,493
- Fuck you always picking on me for?
- No, fuck you!

1320
01:28:56,631 --> 01:28:58,394
And what about O'Keefe?
We're in the same boat.

1321
01:28:58,532 --> 01:29:01,160
One day at a fucking time, right,
O'Keefe? You know what I mean?

1322
01:29:01,302 --> 01:29:02,701
What, it's all right
for him to be here?

1323
01:29:02,837 --> 01:29:05,203
Why am I the fuckin' problem?
I'm his blood, I'm his family!

1324
01:29:05,339 --> 01:29:07,364
- You are the problem!
- I'm the one fighting, OK?

1325
01:29:07,508 --> 01:29:09,976
Not you, not you, and not you.

1326
01:29:11,412 --> 01:29:13,346
- I know what I need.
- And you need Dicky?

1327
01:29:13,481 --> 01:29:15,005
I want Dicky back.

1328
01:29:16,217 --> 01:29:18,515
And I want you, Charlene.
And I want O'Keefe.

1329
01:29:18,653 --> 01:29:21,053
I want my family.
What's wrong with that?

1330
01:29:22,957 --> 01:29:24,948
It's not the deal we made, baby.

1331
01:29:25,092 --> 01:29:26,582
She's right, Micky.
That's not the deal.

1332
01:29:26,727 --> 01:29:30,686
It wasn't the deal.
Come on, you can't do this to us.

1333
01:29:30,831 --> 01:29:32,492
- You sound like them now.
- I sound like them now?

1334
01:29:32,633 --> 01:29:34,260
- Yeah, you sound like them.
- You sound like them.

1335
01:29:34,402 --> 01:29:35,869
How could I do this to you?
"You can't do that to us.

1336
01:29:36,003 --> 01:29:39,632
He can't do that to us."
You sound like them.

1337
01:29:39,774 --> 01:29:41,401
You should fuckin' listen to yourself.

1338
01:29:41,542 --> 01:29:44,102
You sound like them and maybe
this is where you belong.

1339
01:29:44,245 --> 01:29:45,712
That's the way you love him?

1340
01:29:45,846 --> 01:29:47,871
- Charlene!
- Come on!

1341
01:29:48,015 --> 01:29:51,280
- You wanted your brother? Good luck.
- O'Keefe, come on.

1342
01:29:51,419 --> 01:29:54,115
- Mickey.
- Mickey.

1343
01:29:57,224 --> 01:29:59,715
Come on, everything
happens for a reason.

1344
01:30:00,561 --> 01:30:05,726
You know? Maybe it's for the best.
God has a plan.

1345
01:30:08,169 --> 01:30:09,966
Wanna spar with your brother?

1346
01:30:16,644 --> 01:30:18,771
Dick Eklund, pride of Lowell!

1347
01:30:19,714 --> 01:30:21,807
Watching that for years, huh?

1348
01:30:24,785 --> 01:30:25,877
Micky, Micky!

1349
01:30:26,020 --> 01:30:28,545
Whoa, hey!
What the hell are you doing?

1350
01:30:28,689 --> 01:30:29,951
Micky!

1351
01:30:30,091 --> 01:30:31,991
- Daddy! Daddy, Daddy!
- For crying out loud!

1352
01:30:32,126 --> 01:30:33,684
Take that baby out of here.

1353
01:30:33,828 --> 01:30:35,420
I told you take him away
ten minutes ago!

1354
01:30:36,397 --> 01:30:39,696
Sweetheart, you all right?
You OK? Your back?

1355
01:30:39,834 --> 01:30:43,133
What are you doing?
What's the matter with you?

1356
01:30:43,270 --> 01:30:47,001
Can this be my fight, Alice?
Just once?

1357
01:30:47,141 --> 01:30:50,702
Maybe just this one time
not for Dicky?

1358
01:30:50,845 --> 01:30:52,904
I know you think he's coming back.

1359
01:30:53,047 --> 01:30:54,947
He's 40 years old and doesn't
have a tooth in his head

1360
01:30:55,082 --> 01:30:57,778
- that's his fuckin' own.
- I'll go fuckin' ten rounds.

1361
01:30:57,918 --> 01:31:00,045
Let your brother talk
for a minute here, all right?

1362
01:31:00,187 --> 01:31:01,984
- What are you sayin', sweetheart?
- I'm Shea Neary...

1363
01:31:02,123 --> 01:31:05,183
Shut up before I bust your
fuckin' head open, Dicky.

1364
01:31:05,326 --> 01:31:08,261
- Hey, hey...
- What're you gonna do? I'm Shea Neary.

1365
01:31:08,395 --> 01:31:09,760
You want me to bust
your fuckin' head open?

1366
01:31:09,897 --> 01:31:11,296
Come on, come on! George, please!

1367
01:31:11,432 --> 01:31:13,559
- Dicky!
- Please! What are you saying?

1368
01:31:13,701 --> 01:31:17,159
- Tell me what you're saying.
- This is supposed to be my fight.

1369
01:31:17,304 --> 01:31:19,864
This is my shot at a title.
I won't get another one after this.

1370
01:31:20,007 --> 01:31:21,497
- Am I being selfish?
- No.

1371
01:31:21,642 --> 01:31:24,440
Am I saying, "Micky, Micky, Micky?"
You know what? If I am, I'm sorry.

1372
01:31:24,578 --> 01:31:26,045
I thought I was fightin'
for the championship.

1373
01:31:26,180 --> 01:31:28,205
And I thought you
were my mother, too.

1374
01:31:29,550 --> 01:31:31,575
I am your mother.

1375
01:31:32,453 --> 01:31:34,011
Yeah, Ma.

1376
01:31:36,390 --> 01:31:40,554
Mick, I'm sorry. I had no idea
you felt like that, all right?

1377
01:31:40,694 --> 01:31:42,855
If I made mistakes,
I'm gonna be better.

1378
01:31:44,031 --> 01:31:48,400
I don't wanna hurt you.
I am so sorry. I'm sorry.

1379
01:31:54,208 --> 01:31:55,505
Dicky!

1380
01:31:55,643 --> 01:31:57,008
Stay with him.

1381
01:31:57,978 --> 01:32:01,744
Dicky... Dicky!

1382
01:32:07,288 --> 01:32:09,279
- Dicky!
- Gotta do something.

1383
01:32:09,423 --> 01:32:11,948
Dicky, wait, come on!

1384
01:32:12,092 --> 01:32:16,222
- Micky wants you! I want you!
- I gotta do something.

1385
01:32:16,363 --> 01:32:18,627
I know what that means.
Don't do this!

1386
01:32:47,061 --> 01:32:48,653
Hey, Chan.

1387
01:32:53,367 --> 01:32:55,858
- What's going on?
- Hey, Dicky.

1388
01:32:57,805 --> 01:32:59,238
Hey, Dicky's back!

1389
01:32:59,373 --> 01:33:00,965
Hey!

1390
01:33:02,943 --> 01:33:04,240
Look at you!

1391
01:33:04,378 --> 01:33:07,506
What's up, my boy?
How you doing? Good to see you, man.

1392
01:33:07,648 --> 01:33:11,175
- You look good. Welcome back.
- Yeah, you're looking good.

1393
01:33:11,318 --> 01:33:12,979
- Great.
- Good to see ya.

1394
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:15,645
- Welcome home.
- Hi, honey.

1395
01:33:17,458 --> 01:33:19,790
What's up, man?
You're looking good.

1396
01:33:19,927 --> 01:33:22,259
- Wanna head upstairs?
- Dicky's back.

1397
01:33:22,396 --> 01:33:24,762
- Hi, Dicky. We're gonna party.
- Go upstairs, man?

1398
01:33:28,736 --> 01:33:31,603
- Go upstairs, take a while?
- We missed you!

1399
01:33:31,739 --> 01:33:34,970
- Let's go, buddy.
- Come on, Dicky.

1400
01:33:38,479 --> 01:33:42,438
- Make for a little party for you...
- Hey, come back.

1401
01:33:43,284 --> 01:33:45,718
- What the fuck's that all about?
- What the hell was that?

1402
01:34:01,669 --> 01:34:04,331
Charlene? It's Dicky.

1403
01:34:06,106 --> 01:34:08,336
<i>Get off my porch,
you piece of shit.</i>

1404
01:34:10,711 --> 01:34:12,338
<i>How fuckin' dare you...</i>

1405
01:34:13,781 --> 01:34:14,975
<i>... cocksucker...</i>

1406
01:34:15,783 --> 01:34:16,909
<i>... fuckin'...</i>

1407
01:34:20,354 --> 01:34:21,685
You're a fuckin' asshole, Dicky.

1408
01:34:21,822 --> 01:34:23,722
I want you off my fuckin' porch!

1409
01:34:23,857 --> 01:34:26,917
Why don't you just fuckin'
come down here and talk to me?

1410
01:34:27,061 --> 01:34:29,393
Such an asshole, coming to my
fucking house. You piece of shit!

1411
01:34:29,530 --> 01:34:31,088
- Standing on my porch...
- Charlene...

1412
01:34:31,231 --> 01:34:34,860
It's not fuckin' lady-like to be
shoutin' in the street like this.

1413
01:34:35,002 --> 01:34:36,731
You're such a fuckin' cocksucker
coming over here.

1414
01:34:36,870 --> 01:34:38,701
- Please?
- Oh, yeah, you think I fuckin' care?

1415
01:34:38,839 --> 01:34:42,070
- Come on, just fuckin'...
- Get off my fuckin' porch, Dicky!

1416
01:34:42,209 --> 01:34:46,111
Would you just fuckin'
come down here... and talk to me?

1417
01:34:55,689 --> 01:34:58,419
What kind of dog is that?
Is that a Cocker Spaniel?

1418
01:35:04,064 --> 01:35:05,759
All right, I know you
can't fuckin' stand me.

1419
01:35:05,899 --> 01:35:07,059
Really, what makes you say that?

1420
01:35:07,201 --> 01:35:10,693
I ain't got no use for you, either.
All right? But my brother loves ya.

1421
01:35:10,838 --> 01:35:12,999
And you can't just
run away because of me.

1422
01:35:13,140 --> 01:35:15,108
He don't deserve that. All right?

1423
01:35:15,242 --> 01:35:17,733
So I will quit if you want me to quit.

1424
01:35:17,878 --> 01:35:20,711
- You're full of shit.
- I swear to God.

1425
01:35:20,848 --> 01:35:22,816
I will quit if it means
you'll come back, all right?

1426
01:35:22,950 --> 01:35:24,577
But I want you to think about something.

1427
01:35:24,718 --> 01:35:27,744
Micky has a chance to do
something that I never did.

1428
01:35:27,888 --> 01:35:29,446
That in my time, I never had.

1429
01:35:29,590 --> 01:35:32,650
"Oh, yeah, my big chance
was with Sugar Ray Leonard.

1430
01:35:32,793 --> 01:35:34,727
I'm so great.
I'm the pride of fuckin' Lowell.

1431
01:35:34,862 --> 01:35:36,853
Oh, yeah, I fought Sugar Ray Leonard."
I've heard it.

1432
01:35:36,997 --> 01:35:38,225
I came here to make things right.

1433
01:35:38,365 --> 01:35:39,764
- OK, let's make things right.
- Yeah.

1434
01:35:39,900 --> 01:35:44,166
Number one: You didn't knock down
Sugar Ray Leonard. He tripped.

1435
01:35:45,806 --> 01:35:48,434
I was in the ring. Don't you think
I know what really happened that day?

1436
01:35:48,575 --> 01:35:51,908
All right? What have you
ever done with your life?

1437
01:35:52,046 --> 01:35:54,071
- I like my life.
- Yeah, what you ever done with it?

1438
01:35:54,214 --> 01:35:56,944
- I like my life now, Dicky.
- What have you done with your life?

1439
01:35:57,084 --> 01:35:58,483
You're a college dropout, Charlene.

1440
01:35:58,619 --> 01:36:01,417
You're just a little bar girl.
Your life sucks.

1441
01:36:02,890 --> 01:36:05,950
All right. I drank too much.

1442
01:36:06,093 --> 01:36:08,152
I worked in a lot of bars.

1443
01:36:08,295 --> 01:36:11,287
And I ruined a lot of opportunities, but
I'm trying to do something better here.

1444
01:36:11,432 --> 01:36:13,798
- And so is Micky.
- And so am I.

1445
01:36:15,602 --> 01:36:20,437
And he needs me. You heard him.
And I know he needs you.

1446
01:36:23,544 --> 01:36:25,637
What is that blue shit on your arm?

1447
01:36:26,847 --> 01:36:28,474
It's icing.

1448
01:36:31,685 --> 01:36:36,019
OK. I'll see ya in Micky's corner.
Otherwise, go fuck yourself.

1449
01:36:36,156 --> 01:36:38,090
- It's a deal.
- All right? It's a deal.

1450
01:36:50,637 --> 01:36:52,901
We worked it out for you. Ask her.

1451
01:36:54,575 --> 01:36:58,136
Good. Go get O'Keefe back, too.

1452
01:36:59,179 --> 01:37:00,942
I will.

1453
01:37:06,220 --> 01:37:07,278
Hey, Mick...

1454
01:37:09,690 --> 01:37:13,148
You think I knocked down
Sugar Ray Leonard?

1455
01:37:13,293 --> 01:37:17,059
Went ten rounds. One of the best
ever and he couldn't hurt you.

1456
01:37:17,197 --> 01:37:19,131
You were my hero.

1457
01:37:19,766 --> 01:37:21,563
I was.

1458
01:37:23,103 --> 01:37:24,627
I was.

1459
01:37:29,810 --> 01:37:31,835
I'm sorry.

1460
01:37:31,979 --> 01:37:33,537
You are?

1461
01:38:51,458 --> 01:38:53,551
There's a press conference downstairs.

1462
01:38:54,428 --> 01:38:55,986
Come on, let's go.

1463
01:38:56,496 --> 01:38:57,622
Spot of tea, mate!

1464
01:38:57,764 --> 01:39:01,894
Neary: Ten stone... six pound.

1465
01:39:08,542 --> 01:39:12,603
Ward: Ten stone... six pound.

1466
01:39:13,747 --> 01:39:16,511
Hey, Micky, Micky Ward!
We have a question over here.

1467
01:39:18,752 --> 01:39:21,721
- How you been training?
- I train, I train hard.

1468
01:39:21,855 --> 01:39:24,119
Shea's 22 and 0.
He's never been knocked down.

1469
01:39:24,258 --> 01:39:26,590
- That's gonna change tomorrow.
- In fact, we expected

1470
01:39:26,727 --> 01:39:27,955
a much better fighter.

1471
01:39:28,862 --> 01:39:30,762
I'm just grateful to be here
and have the opportunity.

1472
01:39:30,897 --> 01:39:32,364
Thank you guys for the shot.

1473
01:39:32,499 --> 01:39:36,595
Shea, who do you respect as a fighter?
And who would you like to fight next?

1474
01:39:37,838 --> 01:39:40,170
I plan on moving right
through Micky Ward tomorrow.

1475
01:39:40,307 --> 01:39:42,400
Moving on to other great fighters,
like Gatti.

1476
01:39:42,542 --> 01:39:44,806
Yeah, I believe Gatti and I
would make a great match.

1477
01:39:44,945 --> 01:39:46,435
Are you scared, Mr. Ward?

1478
01:39:59,559 --> 01:40:02,824
And now, ladies and
gentlemen, 12 rounds of boxing

1479
01:40:02,963 --> 01:40:08,595
for the WBU Welterweight
Championship of the World!

1480
01:40:12,572 --> 01:40:13,698
I can't see!

1481
01:40:15,175 --> 01:40:18,576
<i>Here I go again on my own</i>

1482
01:40:20,247 --> 01:40:23,808
<i>Goin' down the only road
I've ever known</i>

1483
01:40:25,485 --> 01:40:29,751
<i>Like a drifter
I was born to walk alone</i>

1484
01:40:31,124 --> 01:40:34,651
<i>- Hey, fellas, let's go.
- I made up my mind</i>

1485
01:40:37,230 --> 01:40:40,097
<i>I ain't wasting no more time</i>

1486
01:40:41,501 --> 01:40:45,904
<i>Here I go again on my own</i>

1487
01:40:47,107 --> 01:40:50,770
<i>Going down the only road
I've ever known</i>

1488
01:40:52,379 --> 01:40:56,008
<i>Like a drifter I was born
to walk alone</i>

1489
01:40:56,149 --> 01:40:58,083
Don't listen to 'em, Mick.

1490
01:40:59,019 --> 01:41:01,579
<i>I made up my mind</i>

1491
01:41:04,057 --> 01:41:07,288
<i>I ain't wasting no more time...</i>

1492
01:41:11,298 --> 01:41:13,528
And there is Micky Ward
of Lowell, Massachusetts,

1493
01:41:13,667 --> 01:41:17,068
entering the ring. It's his
first fight outside the United States.

1494
01:41:17,204 --> 01:41:23,200
<i>Micky Ward: 30 wins, seven losses.
He's gotten better recently, 20 KOs.</i>

1495
01:41:24,544 --> 01:41:28,105
<i>And now Ward awaits his
opponent, Shea Neary.</i>

1496
01:41:28,248 --> 01:41:33,049
Neary regards himself
as the European Arturo Gatti.

1497
01:41:33,186 --> 01:41:35,814
Meaning that he is a head-on,
high-contact fighter

1498
01:41:35,956 --> 01:41:38,789
who throws 70 punches per round.

1499
01:41:40,360 --> 01:41:42,021
Neary's from Liverpool
and should have

1500
01:41:42,162 --> 01:41:44,096
a huge following here tonight.

1501
01:41:46,032 --> 01:41:50,526
<i>Accompanied
by Paint the Town Red by The Mahones.</i>

1502
01:41:50,670 --> 01:41:54,106
Neary is the current
Welterweight Champion of the World.

1503
01:41:54,241 --> 01:41:57,870
He is a very tough young man.
Beyond dedicated.

1504
01:41:58,011 --> 01:42:01,845
Lives a Spartan existence.
And according to his promoters,

1505
01:42:01,982 --> 01:42:06,385
does nothing but eat,
drink, think, fantasize...

1506
01:42:06,520 --> 01:42:08,920
...dream of fighting.

1507
01:42:09,055 --> 01:42:12,718
Shea Neary has had 22
professional fights and won them all.

1508
01:42:12,859 --> 01:42:14,850
Seventeen KOs.

1509
01:42:25,138 --> 01:42:28,767
Come out when you hear the bell.
Don't piss about. Shake hands.

1510
01:42:28,909 --> 01:42:32,936
Both of ya... shake hands!

1511
01:42:33,079 --> 01:42:36,913
As close as we just saw
them in the middle of the ring,

1512
01:42:37,050 --> 01:42:39,382
- forehead to forehead,
- Did you see that?

1513
01:42:39,519 --> 01:42:45,151
That's how close we expect them to be
for as long as this fight goes on.

1514
01:42:45,292 --> 01:42:47,226
Ward is a long ways from home.

1515
01:42:47,360 --> 01:42:49,089
Don't coast in a foreign country.

1516
01:42:49,229 --> 01:42:50,958
Well, the big challenge for Ward

1517
01:42:51,097 --> 01:42:54,089
is to get off to a faster start
than is customary for him.

1518
01:42:54,234 --> 01:42:57,795
Micky Ward, a notoriously
slow starter in big fights,

1519
01:42:57,938 --> 01:43:00,372
Shea Neary, an ultra-fast starter.

1520
01:43:00,507 --> 01:43:02,737
And that's the question
that hovers over round one.

1521
01:43:02,876 --> 01:43:04,400
Will Ward be ready for the fight?

1522
01:43:04,544 --> 01:43:07,980
Already, Shea Neary starts
taking it to him on the ropes!

1523
01:43:08,114 --> 01:43:11,242
And Neary going to the body,
which is Ward's specialty.

1524
01:43:12,552 --> 01:43:14,747
Neary bangs Ward to the body.

1525
01:43:14,888 --> 01:43:16,753
And a big uppercut by Neary.

1526
01:43:16,890 --> 01:43:19,120
Neary leads off with a good left jab.

1527
01:43:19,259 --> 01:43:21,193
- Come on, Micky!
- Keeps Ward off balance,

1528
01:43:21,328 --> 01:43:22,693
jabbing here and there.

1529
01:43:24,731 --> 01:43:28,895
There's a good left hook
by Neary as he stepped in on Ward.

1530
01:43:29,035 --> 01:43:33,938
Ward not able to deal with him very well
when Neary stands at range like this.

1531
01:43:34,074 --> 01:43:36,065
- Come on!
- That's it! Get him!

1532
01:43:36,209 --> 01:43:38,734
And a left hook
lands up top from Micky Ward.

1533
01:43:39,913 --> 01:43:41,778
Neary digging his
own right hand to the body.

1534
01:43:41,915 --> 01:43:43,883
They trade shots at close range.

1535
01:43:45,218 --> 01:43:47,618
Ward, he's trying
to match Neary blow for blow

1536
01:43:47,754 --> 01:43:53,090
and now Neary starts to come on and
take the last 30 seconds of the round...

1537
01:43:53,226 --> 01:43:54,420
How about that?

1538
01:43:54,561 --> 01:43:55,789
Break!

1539
01:43:57,030 --> 01:43:59,897
Tremendous barrage in
the first minute. Just look at this.

1540
01:44:00,033 --> 01:44:03,594
- Unbelievable.
- What a great round one!

1541
01:44:03,737 --> 01:44:07,537
Ward is gonna have
to pick up the tempo

1542
01:44:07,674 --> 01:44:09,767
and beat him with volumes of punching.

1543
01:44:09,910 --> 01:44:13,004
<i>No doubt, Neary is a better boxer.</i>

1544
01:44:15,482 --> 01:44:20,317
Four hard right hands...
Neary has belted in the last minute.

1545
01:44:20,453 --> 01:44:23,820
Quicker than Ward,
more assertive than Ward,

1546
01:44:23,957 --> 01:44:25,618
surer of what he wants to do.

1547
01:44:25,759 --> 01:44:28,421
They're standing and trading shots
at the center of the ring.

1548
01:44:28,562 --> 01:44:30,462
Ward's gonna have
to step it up a little bit more

1549
01:44:30,597 --> 01:44:31,723
than he is right now.

1550
01:44:31,865 --> 01:44:33,662
Micky Ward's corner
taking a real deep look

1551
01:44:33,800 --> 01:44:35,097
at what's going on now.

1552
01:44:35,235 --> 01:44:38,898
And his family at ringside well aware
he's stepping up in class.

1553
01:44:39,039 --> 01:44:41,974
Ward has fallen to the pedal.
He's gotta be more aggressive.

1554
01:44:42,108 --> 01:44:44,303
He can't just try to wait
until everything is perfect.

1555
01:44:44,444 --> 01:44:47,436
His dominance over Micky Ward
is increasing as the fight goes on

1556
01:44:47,581 --> 01:44:51,950
because his technical plan
was the right one and he's executing it.

1557
01:44:52,085 --> 01:44:55,782
Punches like these make it seem...

1558
01:44:56,623 --> 01:44:59,285
...that it's now Neary's fight.

1559
01:45:00,794 --> 01:45:02,728
Ward hasn't been in this kind of war

1560
01:45:02,862 --> 01:45:05,296
with this strong of fighter as Neary.

1561
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:10,959
They are trying
to hurt each other with every punch.

1562
01:45:11,104 --> 01:45:15,598
They've tested each other's will,
now they're testing each other's skill.

1563
01:45:15,742 --> 01:45:19,007
And Ward wobbled there
by a right cross from Neary!

1564
01:45:19,145 --> 01:45:21,705
Ward hurting now. His legs are gone.

1565
01:45:21,848 --> 01:45:25,409
Neary goes to the body
as he tries to finish Micky.

1566
01:45:26,653 --> 01:45:28,712
Vicious body shots from Neary.

1567
01:45:28,855 --> 01:45:32,382
And Ward still doesn't
even try to move off the ropes!

1568
01:45:32,525 --> 01:45:34,720
I don't know if he can, Jim.

1569
01:45:34,861 --> 01:45:36,920
He's waiting for Neary
to punch himself out.

1570
01:45:37,063 --> 01:45:39,793
Down goes Micky Ward! He may be out.

1571
01:45:39,933 --> 01:45:41,195
That ain't fuckin' it!

1572
01:45:41,334 --> 01:45:44,667
- One... two...
- Come on! That's it!

1573
01:45:46,039 --> 01:45:49,497
- That's my boy!
- Forward! Forward! Come on!

1574
01:45:51,311 --> 01:45:53,472
Ward is out on his feet.

1575
01:45:53,613 --> 01:45:56,582
Loser! Go back to America!

1576
01:45:56,716 --> 01:46:00,117
- This could be it for Micky Ward.
- Dicky, give him the fuckin' stool.

1577
01:46:00,253 --> 01:46:02,278
Charlene, will you get
the fuck outta here.

1578
01:46:02,422 --> 01:46:04,447
He needs to fuckin' sit down!

1579
01:46:05,125 --> 01:46:07,685
His brother's got
Ward jumping to wake up his legs.

1580
01:46:09,596 --> 01:46:13,555
I think this could be Ward's last chance
to turn this fight around.

1581
01:46:13,700 --> 01:46:15,759
It's Micky Ward
against the aggressiveness

1582
01:46:15,902 --> 01:46:17,870
and clean punching of Shea Neary.

1583
01:46:19,039 --> 01:46:22,304
If you don't have your defense up,
you can really get hurt.

1584
01:46:22,442 --> 01:46:24,569
He's making it very
difficult for Micky Ward.

1585
01:46:24,711 --> 01:46:27,339
I don't think he's gonna
get into it at this rate.

1586
01:46:27,480 --> 01:46:29,675
This is a survival mode...

1587
01:46:29,816 --> 01:46:33,616
Are you like me? Was just
good enough to fight Sugar Ray?

1588
01:46:33,753 --> 01:46:35,311
Never had to win, did I?

1589
01:46:35,455 --> 01:46:38,618
You gotta do more in there.
You gotta win a title.

1590
01:46:38,758 --> 01:46:41,750
For you, for me, for Lowell.

1591
01:46:41,895 --> 01:46:44,693
This is your time, all right?
You take it.

1592
01:46:44,831 --> 01:46:46,765
I had my time and I blew it.
You don't have to.

1593
01:46:46,900 --> 01:46:48,697
All right?
You fuckin' get out there,

1594
01:46:48,835 --> 01:46:50,860
and use all the shit
that you've been through,

1595
01:46:51,004 --> 01:46:52,904
all the shit we've gone through
over the fuckin' years

1596
01:46:53,039 --> 01:46:56,065
and you put it in that ring right now.
This is yours. This is fuckin' yours.

1597
01:46:56,209 --> 01:46:59,178
OK. Fuckin' head, body, head, body.

1598
01:46:59,312 --> 01:47:00,904
Say it back to me.
Fuckin' say it back to me.

1599
01:47:01,047 --> 01:47:02,605
- Head, body, head, body.
- Head, body, head, body.

1600
01:47:02,749 --> 01:47:05,411
Get in your mind this is
fucking yours. Fuckin' do it.

1601
01:47:05,552 --> 01:47:07,349
Stay off the fuckin' ropes.

1602
01:47:12,292 --> 01:47:14,487
If I'm in Micky Ward's corner tonight,

1603
01:47:14,627 --> 01:47:17,391
I thinking if he doesn't pick things up
this round and get going,

1604
01:47:17,530 --> 01:47:20,090
he'll just get totally wiped out.

1605
01:47:21,801 --> 01:47:23,894
Off the ropes!
Get off the ropes, Mick!

1606
01:47:25,271 --> 01:47:28,001
Once again, Ward against
the ropes as Neary is free to attack.

1607
01:47:28,141 --> 01:47:30,735
What are you doing? Come on, Mick!

1608
01:47:31,478 --> 01:47:34,379
Sometimes if you wanna win,
you gotta be something that you're not.

1609
01:47:34,514 --> 01:47:36,141
Come on!

1610
01:47:37,183 --> 01:47:39,447
Off the fuckin' ropes, Mick,
that ain't it!

1611
01:47:39,586 --> 01:47:41,451
Neary continues to pound away.

1612
01:47:44,357 --> 01:47:49,693
Don't take no abuse!
This is your time Micky! It's up to you!

1613
01:47:49,829 --> 01:47:53,060
- Two big misses by Neary!
- That's it! That's it!

1614
01:47:53,199 --> 01:47:56,498
Ward seemingly getting his legs back.

1615
01:47:56,636 --> 01:47:58,695
He backs Neary off.

1616
01:47:58,838 --> 01:48:00,635
- Ward trades his way back.
- That's it!

1617
01:48:00,774 --> 01:48:03,242
Ward nods as if to say,
"Come on!"

1618
01:48:03,810 --> 01:48:05,368
"Come on, let's fight!"

1619
01:48:05,512 --> 01:48:07,309
Just imagine if you bought a ticket.

1620
01:48:07,447 --> 01:48:09,745
Closer and closer to Neary's ribcage.

1621
01:48:09,883 --> 01:48:12,579
This is becoming Micky Ward's fight.

1622
01:48:12,719 --> 01:48:14,687
And a left hook to the body
and an uppercut lands

1623
01:48:14,821 --> 01:48:17,153
- and now he backs Neary off.
- Head, body, head fuckin' body!

1624
01:48:18,658 --> 01:48:20,888
Ward hurt Neary with a body shot.

1625
01:48:21,027 --> 01:48:23,689
Ward hurts him again
with that left to the body.

1626
01:48:23,830 --> 01:48:27,527
Oh, and that one plants
Neary on his butt.

1627
01:48:27,667 --> 01:48:30,227
First time in 23 professional fights

1628
01:48:30,370 --> 01:48:33,498
- that Shea Neary has been down.
- This is it! This is it!

1629
01:48:33,640 --> 01:48:36,200
This is it, Micky!

1630
01:48:36,342 --> 01:48:39,402
Keep going! Don't look at me for it!
Take it to him!

1631
01:48:41,881 --> 01:48:46,284
- Come on, Micky, get in there!
- Ward lands a huge left hook!

1632
01:48:46,419 --> 01:48:49,183
As Micky Ward pounds away!

1633
01:48:49,322 --> 01:48:53,019
Goes to the body with the left hook!
Lands the uppercut again!

1634
01:48:53,159 --> 01:48:55,127
Neary down for the second time.

1635
01:48:55,261 --> 01:48:57,286
Mickey Vann's gonna stop it there.

1636
01:48:57,430 --> 01:49:01,833
"Irish" Micky Ward
with a big eighth-round TKO!

1637
01:49:02,602 --> 01:49:03,864
He's done it again.

1638
01:49:05,672 --> 01:49:06,866
He's done it again.

1639
01:49:07,006 --> 01:49:11,966
The grinding, gutty Micky Ward
pulls out another big victory!

1640
01:49:24,824 --> 01:49:28,191
You're the champion of the world, Mick!
You're the fuckin' champ of the world!

1641
01:49:29,295 --> 01:49:30,990
You fuckin' did it!

1642
01:49:39,239 --> 01:49:41,707
Oh, you're the best!

1643
01:49:41,841 --> 01:49:46,437
- Oh, I love you!
- My boy's the champion of the world!

1644
01:49:47,347 --> 01:49:48,837
I love you!

1645
01:50:19,345 --> 01:50:22,712
This town always said,
you're a fuckin' boxer, right?

1646
01:50:22,849 --> 01:50:26,785
He thought he was a piece of shit. He
put Lowell back on the map, you know?

1647
01:50:26,920 --> 01:50:28,182
- We.
- I tell ya...

1648
01:50:28,321 --> 01:50:30,585
- We.
- No, but hold on.

1649
01:50:30,723 --> 01:50:32,657
Who used to be the pride of Lowell?

1650
01:50:32,792 --> 01:50:35,226
Right here.
Who's the pride of Lowell now?

1651
01:50:35,361 --> 01:50:38,262
Right there.
That's how it's meant to be, you know?

1652
01:50:38,398 --> 01:50:40,229
Handin' it down to him.

1653
01:50:40,366 --> 01:50:43,858
Nothin' better than that.
Nothin' better than that.

1654
01:50:44,003 --> 01:50:47,564
He did it. I gotta go.
I gotta go.

1655
01:51:16,302 --> 01:51:19,533
Oh, look at cabbage head. Boo Boo!
Quacka!

1656
01:51:22,442 --> 01:51:25,002
- What's up buddy?
- Boo, where's your teeth?

1657
01:51:25,144 --> 01:51:28,307
Oh, I'm under arrest!
Let's go, move it out!

1658
01:51:30,516 --> 01:51:31,915
It's been real, ain't it?

1659
01:51:32,051 --> 01:51:35,487
It's been real, it's been unreal.
It's been a great experience.

1660
01:51:35,621 --> 01:51:37,555
Just glad it's done, finally,

1661
01:51:37,690 --> 01:51:40,750
and thanks to everyone so much,
from the bottom of my heart.

1662
01:51:40,893 --> 01:51:43,259
Thanks so much,
all you Hollywood people.

1663
01:51:43,396 --> 01:51:46,297
Now you know what I mean
when I say I can't get a word in.

1664
01:51:46,432 --> 01:51:49,060
I'm telling ya.
He'll never get a word in.

1665
01:51:49,202 --> 01:51:50,794
- All right, thank you.
- Thank you.

1666
01:51:50,937 --> 01:51:52,905
Peace, everybody.
