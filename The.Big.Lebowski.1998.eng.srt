Pledging their love to the ground

00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:54,453
NARRATOR: Way out West there was this fella.

4
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:56,889
Fella I wanna tell you about.

5
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,425
Fella by the name of Jeff Lebowski.

6
00:01:00,426 --> 00:01:04,129
£east that was the handle that his loving parents gave him.

7
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:07,266
But he never had much use for it himself.

8
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:11,403
This Lebowski, he called himself the Dude.

9
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:13,539
Now Dude,

10
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:17,309
that's a name no one would self-apply where I come from.

11
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:22,781
But then there was a lot about the Dude that didn't make a whole lot of sense to me,

12
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:25,517
and a lot about where he lived likewise.

13
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:27,786
Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds

14
00:01:27,787 --> 00:01:29,455
NARRATOR: But then again,

15
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:32,624
maybe that's why I found the place so darned interesting.

16
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:34,660
I know when night has gone

17
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:37,629
That a new world's born at dawn

18
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:41,733
NARRATOR: They call Los Angeles the City of Angels.

19
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:44,870
I didn't find it to be that, exactly.

20
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:48,674
But I'll allow there are some nice folks there.

21
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:51,443
Course, I can't say I seen London,

22
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,779
and I never been to France,

23
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:58,884
and I ain't never seen no queen in her damned undies, as the fella says.

24
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:00,886
But I'll tell you what,

25
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:06,258
after seeing Los Angeles and this here story I'm about to unfold,

26
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:09,194
well, I guess I've seen something

27
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:13,465
every bit as stupefying as you can see in any of those other places,

28
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,701
and in English, too.

29
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:18,704
So I can die with a smile on my face

30
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:21,504
without feeling like the good Lord gypped me.

31
00:02:22,508 --> 00:02:24,610
Now, this here story I'm about to unfold

32
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:27,713
took place back in the early '9·s,

33
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:32,651
just about the time of our conflict with Saddam and the lraqis.

34
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:36,321
I only mention it 'cause sometimes there's a man...

35
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,423
I won't say a hero.

36
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:40,559
'Cause what's a hero?

37
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,961
But sometimes there's a man...

38
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:46,064
And I'm talking about the Dude here.

39
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:48,834
Sometimes there's a man...

40
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:53,505
Well, he's the man for his time and place.

41
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:56,308
He fits right in there.

42
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:59,711
And that's the Dude in Los Angeles.

43
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,515
And even if he is a lazy man,

44
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:06,218
and the Dude was most certainly that,

45
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:10,055
quite possibly the laziest in Los Angeles county,

46
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:13,924
which would place him high in the running for laziest worldwide.

47
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:18,063
But sometimes there's a man...

48
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:20,863
Sometimes there's a man...

49
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:25,804
Well, I lost my train of thought here.

50
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:27,068
But...

51
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:30,475

00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:16,454
Dude, the Chinaman is not the issue here.

167
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:18,957
So, who... Jeff Lebowski.

168
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:22,160
The other Jeffrey Lebowski. The millionaire.

169
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:24,996
That's fucking interesting, man. That's fucking interesting.

170
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:29,067
Plus, he has the wealth, obviously, and the resources,

171
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,670
so that there's no reason, there's no fucking reason

172
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:34,472
why his wife should go out and owe money all over town,

173
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:37,008
and then they come and they pee on your fucking rug!

174
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:38,343
Am I wrong? No.

175
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:39,978
Am I wrong? Yeah, but...

176
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:41,112
WALTER: Okay then.

177
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:42,604
(WALTER CLEARS THROAT)

178
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:45,951
That rug really tied the room together, did it not?

179
00:09:45,951 --> 00:09:47,952
Fucking A. And this guy peed on it.

180
00:09:47,953 --> 00:09:49,354
Donny, please.

181
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:50,622
You know, this is the fucking guy...

182
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:52,991
I could find this fucking Lebowski guy.

183
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:55,427
His name is Lebowski? That's your name, Dude.

184
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:59,798
This is the guy who should compensate me for the fucking rug.

185
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:03,501
His wife goes out and owes money all over town, and they pee on my rug?

186
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:05,637
They pee on your fucking rug?

187
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:08,334
Peed on my fucking rug. That's right, Dude.

188
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:12,108
They peed on your fucking rug.

189
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:15,480
This is the study.

190
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:18,183
As you can see, the various commendations, awards...

191
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:22,153
"Jeffrey Lebowski." ...citations, honorary degrees, et cetera.

192
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:25,890
Very impressive. Oh, please feel free to inspect them.

193
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:28,593
Oh. No, I'm not really... Oh, please. Please.

194
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:30,628
That is the key to the city of Pasadena,

195
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:36,067
which Mr. Lebowski received two years ago in recognition of his various civic...

196
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:40,839
Oh! That's the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce Business Achiever Award,

197
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,074
which is given... Oh, not necessarily given every year.

198
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:44,275
Hey, is this...

199
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:45,577
Given only when there's a worthy somebody...

200
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:46,945
Is this him with Nancy?

201
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:50,281
Yes, indeed, that is Mr. Lebowski with the first lady, yes.

202
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:51,583
It was taken when Mrs. Reagan...

203
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:54,319
That's Lebowski on the left there?

204
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,122
Of course. Mr. Lebowski, on the left... So he's a...

205
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:59,791
You know, a handicapped kind of guy?

206
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:01,954
Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes.

207
00:11:02,661 --> 00:11:05,897
This picture was taken when Mrs. Reagan was first lady of the nation.

208
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:07,065
Yes, yes.

209
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:09,100
Not of California. Good shot.

210
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:11,403
In fact, he met privately with the President,

211
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:14,239
though, unfortunately, there wasn't enough time for a photo opportunity.

212
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,274
Oh, Nancy's pretty good. Oh, wonderful woman.

213
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:18,643
We were very happy to... These are...

214
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:21,413
Oh, those are Mr. Lebowski's children, so to speak.

215
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:22,781
Different mothers, huh?

216
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:25,183
No, they're not... Racially, he's pretty cool?

(LAUGHING)

218
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,720
They're not literally his children.

219
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:31,056
They're the Little Lebowski Urban Achievers,

220
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:34,159
inner city children of promise, but without the necessary means for...

221
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,261
Necessary means for a higher education,

222
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:39,764
so Mr. Lebowski is committed to sending all of them to college.

223
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:41,166
Excuse me. Oh, geez.

224
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:43,068
Thank you. Thank you.

225
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:47,529
Far out. Think he's got room for one more? One... Oh.

226
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:50,508
You never went to college.

227
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:52,644
Please, don't touch that. Oh, yeah, yeah. No, I did,

228
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:55,013
but, you know, I spent most of my time

229
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:58,249
occupying various administration buildings,

230
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,118
smoking a lot of Thai stick,

231

(LAUGHING) breaking into the ROTC and bowling.

What can I do for you, sir?

Well, sir, it's this rug I have.

240
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:27,946
It really tied the room together.

You told Brandt on the phone. He told me.

242

Where do I fit in?

You know, they... I'll say it again.

245
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,493
You told Brandt on the phone. He told me.

00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:43,628
I know what happened. Yes, yes.

Oh, so you know that they were trying to piss on your rug.

Did I urinate on your rug?

00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:51,536
You mean, did you personally come and pee on my rug?

No. Like I said, Woo peed on my rug.

This aggression will not stand, man.

277

I mean, your wife owes money...

My wife is not the issue here!

279

I hope that someday my wife will learn to live on her allowance,

280

which is ample.

00:47:08,859 --> 00:47:12,795
I asked my father about his withdrawal of $1 million from the foundation account,

898
00:47:12,796 --> 00:47:14,697

905
00:47:27,711 --> 00:47:31,614

that instead of, you know, running around, blaming me...

966
00:50:20,984 --> 00:50:23,252
You know, given the nature of all this new shit,

967
00:50:23,253 --> 00:50:29,191
you know, this could be a lot more complex...

968
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:34,230
I mean, it's not just... It might not be just such a simple... You know?

970

Well, I'll tell you what I'm blathering about.

971
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:42,304
I've got information, man.

00:50:44,141 --> 00:50:46,109
And, shit, man,

974
00:50:48,078 --> 00:50:49,978
she kidnapped herself.

975
00:50:53,016 --> 00:50:55,818
Well, sure, man. Look at it. You know?

And that's cool. That's cool.

979
00:51:10,066 --> 00:51:13,969
I'm saying she needs money, man.

980
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:17,634
And, you know, of course they're gonna say they didn't get it

981
00:51:18,942 --> 00:51:21,844
because she wants more, man.

982
00:51:21,845 --> 00:51:24,280
She's gotta feed the monkey. I mean...

983
00:51:26,616 --> 00:51:29,785
Hasn't that ever occurred to you, man?

984

Sir?

985
00:51:33,023 --> 00:51:36,492
No, Mr. Lebowski, it had not occurred to me.

986
00:51:36,493 --> 00:51:38,794
That had not occurred to us, Dude.

987

993
00:51:56,346 --> 00:51:59,415
My concern is, and I've gotta check it with my accountant,

994
00:51:59,416 --> 00:52:02,218
that this might bump me up into a higher tax...

even in the modest task which was your charge,

1000
00:52:21,171 --> 00:52:24,440
since you have stolen my money,

1001
00:52:24,441 --> 00:52:28,210
since you have unrepentantly betrayed my trust,

1002
00:52:28,211 --> 00:52:32,248
I have no choice but to tell these bums

1003
00:52:32,249 --> 00:52:34,550
to do whatever is necessary

1004
00:52:34,551 --> 00:52:38,681
to recover their money from you, Jeffrey Lebowski.

1005
00:52:39,956 --> 00:52:44,093
And with Brandt as my witness, I will tell you this,

1007

Whose toe was it, Walter? How the fuck should I know?

1013

I do know that nothing about it indicates... The nail polish, Walter.

Fine, Dude.

1015

As if it's impossible to get some nail polish, apply it to someone else's toe...

and then they're gonna kill me.

Now, what happened to your face?

Did Jackie Treehorn do that as well?

No, it was the chief of police of Malibu, a real reactionary.

1909
01:47:12,058 --> 01:47:15,995
He was a man who loved the outdoors and bowling.

1910
01:47:16,129 --> 01:47:19,932
And as a surfer he explored the beaches of Southern California

1911
01:47:19,933 --> 01:47:22,835
from La Jolla to Leo Carrillo

1912
01:47:22,836 --> 01:47:25,396
and up to Pismo.

1913
01:47:26,206 --> 01:47:27,469
He died...

1914
01:47:28,441 --> 01:47:32,645
He died as so many young men of his generation, before his time.

1915
01:47:32,646 --> 01:47:35,915
In your wisdom, Lord, you took him,

1916
01:47:35,916 --> 01:47:39,318
as you took so many bright, flowering young men

1917
01:47:39,319 --> 01:47:42,221
at Khe Sanh, at Lan Doc,

1918
01:47:42,222 --> 01:47:43,951
at Hill 364.

1919
01:47:45,258 --> 01:47:47,625
These young men gave their lives,

1920
01:47:48,228 --> 01:47:49,696
and so did Donny.

1921
01:47:51,832 --> 01:47:53,823
Donny, who loved bowling.

1922
01:47:56,870 --> 01:47:57,860
And so,

1923
01:47:59,506 --> 01:48:01,872
Theodore Donald Kerabatsos,

1924
01:48:03,176 --> 01:48:08,273
in accordance with what we think your dying wishes might well have been,

1925
01:48:09,616 --> 01:48:12,415
we commit your final mortal remains

1926
01:48:13,320 --> 01:48:15,720
to the bosom of the Pacific Ocean

1927
01:48:17,190 --> 01:48:19,159
which you loved so well.

1928
01:48:21,494 --> 01:48:23,588
Good night, sweet prince.

1929
01:48:35,075 --> 01:48:36,304
(lNHALES)

1930
01:48:38,745 --> 01:48:40,145
Shit.

1931
01:48:42,082 --> 01:48:44,107
Oh, shit, Dude. I'm sorry.

1932
01:48:45,919 --> 01:48:49,121
Goddamn wind. Fuck, god damn it, Walter!

1933
01:48:49,122 --> 01:48:51,490
You fucking asshole! Shit, Dude. I'm sorry.

1934
01:48:51,491 --> 01:48:53,792
Everything's a fucking travesty with you, man!

1935
01:48:53,793 --> 01:48:55,461
I'm sorry. It was an accident.

1936
01:48:55,462 --> 01:48:58,030
What was that shit about Vietnam? Dude, I'm sorry.

1937
01:48:58,031 --> 01:49:00,432
What the fuck does anything have to do with Vietnam?

1938
01:49:00,433 --> 01:49:02,501
Dude, I'm sorry. What the fuck are you talking about?

1939
01:49:02,502 --> 01:49:04,095
Dude, I'm sorry.

1940
01:49:07,007 --> 01:49:08,235
Fucking...

1941
01:49:15,215 --> 01:49:16,683
Fuck, Walter.

1942
01:49:18,585 --> 01:49:20,075
Come on, Dude.

1943
01:49:20,920 --> 01:49:22,582
Hey, fuck it, man.

1944
01:49:26,493 --> 01:49:28,120
Let's go bowling.

1945
01:49:51,618 --> 01:49:54,917
And when you're sittin' there

1946
01:49:55,555 --> 01:49:58,684
In your silk upholstered chair

1947
01:50:00,193 --> 01:50:04,221
Talkin' to some rich folks that you know

1948
01:50:07,567 --> 01:50:10,400
Well, I hope you don't see me

1949
01:50:11,404 --> 01:50:14,636
In my ragged company

1950
01:50:15,408 --> 01:50:20,471
O? but you know I could never be alone

1951
01:50:22,649 --> 01:50:25,718
Two oat sodas, Gary. Right. Good luck tomorrow.

1952
01:50:25,719 --> 01:50:29,254
Yeah, thanks, man. I was sorry to hear about Donny.

1953
01:50:29,255 --> 01:50:32,123
Oh, yeah. Well, you know,

1954
01:50:32,959 --> 01:50:37,029
sometimes you eat the bear, and sometimes, you know...

1955
01:50:37,030 --> 01:50:38,293
Hey, man.

1956
01:50:39,099 --> 01:50:42,368
How do you do, Dude? I wondered if I'd see you again.

1957
01:50:42,369 --> 01:50:44,503
I wouldn't miss the semis.

1958
01:50:44,504 --> 01:50:46,205
Oh, yeah? How's things been going?

1959
01:50:46,206 --> 01:50:49,408
Well, you know, strikes and gutters, ups and downs.

1960
01:50:49,409 --> 01:50:52,105
Sure. I got you. Yeah.

1961
01:50:53,680 --> 01:50:54,780
Thanks, Gary.

1962
01:50:54,781 --> 01:50:57,216
Well, take care, man. Gotta get back.

1963
01:50:57,217 --> 01:51:00,352
Sure. Take it easy, Dude. Oh, yeah.

1964
01:51:00,353 --> 01:51:02,521
I know that you will.

1965
01:51:02,522 --> 01:51:05,856
Yeah. Well, the Dude abides.

1966
01:51:09,863 --> 01:51:11,057
Walter.

1967
01:51:12,766 --> 01:51:14,734
The Dude abides.

1968
01:51:18,638 --> 01:51:21,972
I don't know about you, but I take comfort in that.

1969
01:51:23,276 --> 01:51:25,577
It's good knowing he's out there,

1970
01:51:25,578 --> 01:51:29,640
the Dude, taking her easy for all us sinners.

1971
01:51:32,385 --> 01:51:34,547
I sure hope he makes the finals.

1972
01:51:36,156 --> 01:51:38,357
Well, that about does her.

1973
01:51:38,358 --> 01:51:39,848
Wraps her all up.

1974
01:51:41,461 --> 01:51:44,920
Things seem to have worked out pretty good for the Dude and Walter.

1975
01:51:45,598 --> 01:51:48,864
And it was a pretty good story, don't you think?

1976
01:51:49,736 --> 01:51:52,068
Made me laugh to beat the band.

1977
01:51:52,705 --> 01:51:54,173
Parts anyway.

1978
01:51:55,742 --> 01:51:57,904
I didn't like seeing Donny go.

1979
01:51:59,012 --> 01:52:04,041
But then I happen to know that there's a little Lebowski on the way.

1980
01:52:05,718 --> 01:52:09,052
I guess that's the way the whole darned human comedy keeps

1981
01:52:09,622 --> 01:52:12,024
perpetuating itself

1982
01:52:12,025 --> 01:52:14,187
down through the generations.

1983
01:52:14,694 --> 01:52:18,961
Westward the wagons, across the sands of time until we...

1984
01:52:20,166 --> 01:52:23,363
Oh, look at me. I'm rambling again.

1985
01:52:24,771 --> 01:52:27,263
Well, I hope you folks enjoyed yourselves.

1986
01:52:27,740 --> 01:52:30,073
Catch you later on down the trail.

1987
01:52:31,277 --> 01:52:34,372
Say, friend, you got any more of that good sarsaparilla?

1988
01:52:57,337 --> 01:53:01,406
Take me down, little Susie

1989
01:53:01,407 --> 01:53:03,239
Take me down

Send me dead flowers every morning

1993
01:53:23,296 --> 01:53:27,824
Send me dead flowers by the mail

1994
01:53:31,604 --> 01:53:36,064
Send me dead flowers to my wedding

1995
01:53:38,611 --> 01:53:45,779
And I won't forget to put roses on your grave

1996
01:53:46,886 --> 01:53:51,290
No, I won't forget to put roses

1997
01:53:51,291 --> 01:53:55,591
On your grave
