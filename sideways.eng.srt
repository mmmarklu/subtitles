You see, the reason that this regionis so good for pinot...

266
00:18:05,252 --> 00:18:08,585
is that the cold air off the Pacificflows in at night...

and it just cools down the berries.

[ Miles ]Let me show you how this is done.

271
00:18:22,836 --> 00:18:25,737
First thing-- hold the glass up andexamine the wine against the light.

272

- Okay?- Okay.

276
00:18:35,682 --> 00:18:37,582
Now tip it.

277
00:18:37,684 --> 00:18:42,144
What you're doing here is checking for colordensity as it thins out towards the rim.

278
00:18:42,256 --> 00:18:45,157
That's gonna tell you how old it is,among other things.

279
00:18:45,259 --> 00:18:47,159
It's usuallymore important with reds.

280
00:18:47,261 --> 00:18:49,161
- Okay?- Okay.

281
00:18:49,263 --> 00:18:51,163
Now stick your nose in it.

- Strawberries. Not the cheese.- All right.

295
00:19:27,801 --> 00:19:30,702
Put your glass down.Get some air into it.

296
00:19:30,804 --> 00:19:32,704
Oxygenating it opens it up.

297
00:19:32,806 --> 00:19:35,468
It unlocks the aromas, the flavors.Very important.

and that you proposed to Christinefor some good reason...

317
00:21:08,802 --> 00:21:11,202
so I think it's great.

318
00:21:11,305 --> 00:21:13,205
It's time.

319
00:21:13,307 --> 00:21:16,208
I mean, you gotta have your eyes open,that's all.

320
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:20,212
I mean, look at me.I thought Victoria and I were set for life.

321
00:21:20,314 --> 00:21:23,215
Christine's dad,he's really been talking to me...

322
00:21:23,317 --> 00:21:27,219
about bringing me into his property business,showing me the ropes.

323
00:21:27,321 --> 00:21:31,223
Which is something, considering how longit took him to get over my not being Armenian.

324
00:21:31,325 --> 00:21:33,225
So I'm thinking about it.

325
00:21:33,327 --> 00:21:35,227
But I don't know.

326
00:21:35,329 --> 00:21:37,229
Might get a little incestuous.

327
00:21:37,331 --> 00:21:40,232
But Mike does great.A lot of high-end commercial stuff.

328
00:21:40,334 --> 00:21:42,734
- So you're gonna stop acting?- No way! No.

329
00:21:42,836 --> 00:21:45,566
This would just provide some stability.

330
00:21:45,672 --> 00:21:49,301
I could always squeeze in a commercialor an audition here, there.

331
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:52,310
Keep myself in the game in casesomething really great came along.

332
00:21:52,412 --> 00:21:54,312
We're not getting any younger, Miles.

Pour us a couple, will ya.

349

Here's to us.

355
00:23:12,459 --> 00:23:14,359
- Miles.- Mm-hmm?

356
00:23:14,461 --> 00:23:16,861
Check out that chick.

357
00:23:16,963 --> 00:23:19,557
Oh. Yeah. That's Maya.

358
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:22,567
- You know her?- Sure, I know Maya.

359
00:23:22,669 --> 00:23:26,264
- You know that chick?- Yes.Jack, this is where I eatwhen I come up here.

360
00:23:26,373 --> 00:23:28,568
You know?It's practically my office.

361
00:23:28,675 --> 00:23:31,576
And occasionally I have a drinkwith the employees, yeah.

362
00:23:31,678 --> 00:23:35,580
Maya's great.She's worked here a year,year and a half.

363
00:23:35,682 --> 00:23:37,582
She's incredibly hot.

364
00:23:37,684 --> 00:23:39,948
Yes, she is.And nice. And married.

Check out the rock.

Oh, that doesn't mean shit.

367
00:23:44,057 --> 00:23:45,957
When Christine worked at Sushi Roku...

368
00:23:46,059 --> 00:23:48,789
she wore a big engagement ringto keep guys from hitting on her.

369
00:23:48,895 --> 00:23:51,796
Think it worked? Fuck no.How do you think I met her?

370
00:23:51,898 --> 00:23:56,801
Well, this gal is married to somephilosophy professor at U.C. Santa Barbara.

371
00:23:56,903 --> 00:24:00,236
What's a professor's wife doing waitressing?Obviously that's over.

372
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:03,241
Jack, you don't know anythingabout this woman.

373
00:24:03,343 --> 00:24:06,437
Calm down. Let's just eat.

You look great.Did you lose some weight?

00:24:18,658 --> 00:24:21,218
Uh... no, actually.

378

What else do you know about her?

389
00:24:48,655 --> 00:24:50,782
Well, she does know a lot about wine.

390
00:24:51,892 --> 00:24:54,827
Ah. Now we're getting somewhere.

- She likes pinot.- Perfect!

392
00:24:57,931 --> 00:25:00,399
She's a fucking waitressin Buellton,Jack.

393
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,400
How is that ever gonna work out?

394
00:25:02,502 --> 00:25:04,800
You dick. Why do you have tofocus on the negative?

395
00:25:04,905 --> 00:25:08,636
- See how friendly she was to you?- She works for tips.

396
00:25:10,443 --> 00:25:12,343
You're blind, dude. Blind.

397

No, Maya, I'm an actor.

Mmm, a lot ofTV.

I would appreciate a little bit of help.

448
00:27:39,793 --> 00:27:43,194
Didn't seem to me like that's whatwas going on. You were all over her.

449
00:27:43,296 --> 00:27:45,696
Well, somebody had to do the talking.
