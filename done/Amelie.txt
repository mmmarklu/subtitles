三分鐘不到，上天給了答覆

不過，降臨在聖母院廣場的

從此行俠仗義改善他人命運
若對方沒感覺，就算了
lf not, too bad.
五樓小姐…要見到你真難得！

嗯…不，謝謝
- No thanks.
- Come in! Close the door.
別客氣，進來坐，把門關上
嗯…我見過太多小男孩
Boys? l've known so many.
剛開始很可愛
They're cute, until they discover
snowballs and chestnuts.
後來紙屑果皮口香糖到處亂扔

l've known so many boys.
你哪一年住進這兒？
When did you come here?

沒…沒聽過
No...
是嗎？真奇怪，你坐你坐…

我丈夫生前在"瓢蟲保險"上班
My husband worked
for Ladybird lnsurance.
同事最愛亂傳他和女秘書偷情
lt's no secret
he slept with his secretary.
他們睡遍全巴底紐的旅館
They used every hotel around.
而且只挑高檔旅館
Not cheap ones, either.
女秘書雖然是靠張腿吃飯
The bimbo liked spreading her legs,
但綾羅綢緞不能少
but only on satin.
於是，我丈夫開始挪用公款
So he swiped from the till.
起初挪很少後來五千萬一次偷光
A little at first, then 50 million.
最後兩人竟落跑到阿根廷高原
Off they flew to Panama.
喝酒！
Drink up!

On January 20th 1970,
門外有人按電鈴

He wrote this
from the army camp.
"親愛的瑪朵…"
''Darling Mado.''
瑪朵是小名，我叫瑪德蓮

appears at the station
"身穿藍色細盾帶洋裝"
''in her blue dress...''
括號裏註明：
in brackets ''the one you think
is too transparent.''
"你覺得太透明的那件"
有人寫過這樣的信給你嗎？
Did anyone ever write you that?
沒有，我是沒有人愛的小鼬鼠
l'm nobody's little weasel.
我名叫瑪德蓮華拉斯
My name's Madeleine Wells.
瑪德蓮是聖經中哭泣的女罪人
Madeleine, like Mary Magdalene.
傳言是這樣說的嗎？
She wept, right?
華拉斯，意思是噴泉
Wells, as in water.
Talk about being born to cry!
所以，我注定一輩子流眼淚
嗯…至於你的問題
About your question...

五0年代我才二歲
ln 1950, l was two.
The mental age of this cretin.
跟這白癡的心智年齡一樣
這個"白癡"就是路希昂
The ''cretin'' is Lucien.
他也許不是天才，但她偏偏喜歡
He's no genius but Amelie likes him.
She likes the way
他拿萵苣像觸摸稀世珍寶
he handles each endive
like a precious object
帶著敬意小心翼翼
to be treated with care.
lt's his way of showing
表達對工作要求完美的熱誠
his love of good work.
你看看他…還以為
Look at him!
Like he's nursing a baby bird!
那是掉落鳥巢的小小鳥
你沒找他買葡萄乾？算你好運
Don't ask him for currants.
否則得等下星期一再來拿！
You'd be here till Monday!
喂，動作快！智障呀你！
Get moving, spastic!
人家要做的事可多著呢！
She hasn't got all day!

was punching metro tickets.
最近三個月，他夜夜失眠
Now he gets up every night
to punch holes in my laurel!
拿起剪票機專找我的月桂開洞
生命豈能盡如人意
Too bad it's not hardy.
人人都需要放鬆心情的小秘方
We all need a way to relax.
像我，就喜歡打水漂

- l'll find it, don't worry.
我做事有條不紊，全都作紀錄
l'm very organized.

- Like what?
等到兒子50歲
Your son's nearly 50, and l'm still
doing his bookkeeping!

You were still squeezing
his toothpaste at 15.
你還替他擠牙膏，這都是報應

the joy that you give

When l'm in your arms l'm under your charms

Nino had too many.
小尼諾卻希望他的朋友統統消失
兩人相隔九公里，卻常同時幻想
5 miles apart, they both dreamed
他想有個妹妹，她想有個弟弟

陪伴他們共度一生
to be with all the time.
嗨！爸，你交了新朋友
Hi, Dad. A new friend?
不，我們是老朋友了
l've had him for years.
你媽不喜歡，只好收進工具箱
Your mother hated him,
so he lived in the toolshed.
現在，就來化解舊恨吧！
There. Let's reconcile them.
好啦，不賴嘛
How about that?
若你意外找到童年珍藏寶物
Dad, if you found a precious relic
from your childhood,
你會怎樣？高興？感傷？懷舊？
how would you feel?
Happy? Sad? Nostalgic?
對你有什麼影響？
這個小矮人不是什麼童年珍藏

的確，若是拜倒在洗手台前…
就表示有夠難吃
Not good!

There are plenty of other bars!
附近每二十公尺就有一家餐館
蘇珊太太
Suzanne?
局萵苣必須加奶油調味汁嗎？
''Au gratin'' means white sauce, right?
對呀，那又如何？
Yes, why?
我對那種醬不消化，會讓我…
l can't stomach it.
Like you and horsemeat.
就像你對馬肉一樣
對我來說，不是消化問題
lt's not my stomach, it's my memory.
記憶造成的影響才是問題

進來！進來嘛
Come in.
我住了四年，第一次見到你
l've lived here for 4 years.
l never saw you before.

我的名字叫何蒙杜法耶

雙磨坊當女侍，這我知道
柏都多尋人歷險毫無所獲吧

Because it's not ''do'', it's ''to''.
Like ''Toto''.

他們就會故意改變表情
They look quite happy.
他們看起來很不錯啊
They should be!
那當然！今年有兔肉大餐

她位在正中央，卻像個局外人
She's in the middle, yet she's outside.
也許，她只是與眾不同
Maybe she's just different.
什麼方面不同？
ln what way?
我不曉得
l don't know.
她幼年很少和其他孩子一起玩
When she was little,
she rarely played with other kids.
也許從來沒玩過
Maybe never.
拿去吧，多米尼克柏都多
Dominique Bretodeau, 27 Rue Mouffetard.
lt's for you.
穆夫達路27號，這是給你的
每個星期二早晨
Every Tuesday morning,
Dominique Bretodeau buys a chicken.
柏都多出門買現宰雞
他把雞和馬鈴薯片放進烤箱
He roasts it with potatoes.
然後切下雞腿、雞翅後
After carving the legs and wings,
他最喜歡：
he loves picking the hot carcass
with his fingers,
用手指將熱騰騰的雞去骨
首先挑出骨盤凹處的肉
starting with the oysters.
但今天情況不同，他不買雞
But not today.
Bretodeau won't buy a chicken.
他走到這座電話亭
He'll go no further
than this phone booth, here.
一瞬間，回憶涌現他的腦海
ln a flash, it all came back:
1959年環法自由車大賽
Bahamontes winning
the Tour de France...
冠軍得主一費德列哥巴艾蒙特…
喬賽特阿姨的連身衣…
Aunt Josette's slips...
尤其那悲慘的一天，下課時
and most of all, the tragic day...
他贏了全班所有的彈珠…
The day he won all the marbles.
柏都多…白目！還不乖乖就範
The pinch, Bretodeau!
請給我一杯甘邑酒
Cognac, please.
我剛經歷不可思議的事
Amazing, what just happened.
絕對是我的守護天使
lt must be my guardian angel.
否則電話亭怎麼可能呼喊我？
The phone booth was calling me...
電話鈴、鈴、鈴響…
剛好我的微波爐也在召喚我
Same here!
The microwave's calling me.
再來一杯甘邑好嗎？
l'll have another cognac.
生命真的太奇妙…
Life's funny.
小時候，總覺時間過得慢吞吞
To a kid, time always drags.
Suddenly you're 50.
轉眼間，就已經50歲
至於童年留下的
All that's left of your childhood
fits in a rusty little box.
全都裝在一個生銹的小盒子裏
小姐，你還沒有小孩吧？
You got kids, Miss?
我女兒，應該跟你差不多大
l have a daughter about your age.
我們已經好幾年都沒講過話
We haven't spoken for years.
聽說她生了個孩子
l heard she had a child, a boy.
His name is Lucas.
是個男孩，名叫路卡
我想我該去探望他們了
lt's time l looked them up,
before l'm in a box myself.
在我入棺前，你不認為嗎？
Don't you think?
艾蜜莉突然有一種奇怪的感覺
Amelie suddenly has
a strange feeling of absolute harmony.
一種與世和平共處的和諧
此刻一切完美無比，陽光柔和
lt's a perfect moment. Soft light,
空氣清香城市安祥地呢喃
a scent in the air,
the quiet murmur of the city...
城市安祥地呢喃
她深呼一口氣
She breathes deeply.
Life is simple and clear.
生命如此簡單而清澈
一股愛的衝動
A surge of love,
an urge to help mankind comes over her.
想幫助全人類的慾望
猛然將她淹沒
我來幫你，小心！馬上出發！
Let me help you.
Step down. Here we go!
首先遇到樂團鼓手的遺孀
The drum major's widow!
丈夫死後始終穿著他的衣服
She's worn his coat
since the day he died.
再來是
The horse's head has lost an ear!
肉店招牌上的馬耳朵少一隻
這笑聲來自花店老闆的老公
That's the florist laughing.
He has crinkly eyes.
他的眼角滿是笑紋
麵包店櫥窗裏有好多糖果
ln the bakery window, lollipops!
嗯…聞到香味了嗎？
Smell that!
他們正在請顧客品嚐甜瓜
They're giving out melon slices.
嗯…還有杏仁口味冰淇淋
Sugarplum ice cream!
接著路過的是肉鋪
We're passing the pork butcher.
火腿79法郎，排骨45法郎
Ham, 79 francs.
Spareribs, 45!
再來是乳酪店
Now the cheese shop.
Picodons are 12.90. Cabecous 23.50.
阿爾代起司12法郎9
潘圖乳酪23法郎5
肉店有個小嬰兒盯著
A baby's watching a dog
that's watching the chickens!
直望著烤難看的小狗
我們這就來到地鐵站書報攤前
Now we're at the kiosk by the metro.
我就陪你到這，再見！
l'll leave you here. Bye!
她從不知如何建立人際關係
''She can't relate to other people.''
小時候，她永遠是孤單一人
''She was always a lonely child.''
晴空萬里的七月天夜晚
On a sparkling evening in July,
夏季遊客在天氣轉晴後
while on the beaches, holiday hordes
忘情地在沙灘上嬉戲
relax in the new-found sun
一群圍觀的群眾
and Paris's sweltering denizens
目睹巴黎天空放著璀璨的煙火
gaze at the starbursts
of the traditional fireworks,
艾蜜莉普蘭，人稱流浪者的教母
Amelie Poulain, Godmother of Outcasts,
Madonna of the Unloved,
歹命的人將她視為聖母
她終因極度疲憊而不支倒地
finally succumbed to exhaustion.
窗外悲傷籠罩整個巴黎
ln Paris's stricken streets,
數百萬哀悼者擠入送行隊伍
a countless throng of mourners
沉默目睹她最後一面
lined her funeral route
in silence
哀悼者對今後將成為孤兒
with the measureless grief
of newly orphaned children.
感到無限痛楚
這位有著奇特命運的女孩
What a strange destiny for one
卻無法掌握自己的生命
who gave her all,
然而她對小事物又十分敏銳
yet took such joy
in life's simple pleasures.
宛如唐吉軻德，決心挑戰
Like Don Quixote, she pitted herself
造成人類苦難的無情風車
against the grinding windmill
of all life's miseries.
然而，未戰先敗
lt was a losing battle
艾蜜莉提前耗盡生命
that claimed her life too soon.
At barely 23, Amelie Poulain
23歲未滿，徒留短暫生命痕跡
let her young, tired body merge
在世界苦難漩渦中逐漸消逝
with the ebb and flow of universal woe.
然而，最讓她痛心遺憾的是
As she went, she felt a stab of regret
for letting her father die
留下父親獨自老死一生
without trying to give
his stifled life
她竟從沒幫助精神受挫的父親
the breath of air she had given
卻成功地幫助過其他人
to so many others.
先生！等等！先生！你等等！
Wait!
許多整頁拍壞的證件照
Pages full of dud lD photos
torn up and discarded by their owners,
被失望主人揉掉、撕裂、丟棄
有個怪胎卻撿來仔細拼湊分類
carefully reassembled by some oddball.
活像一本家族相簿
Some family album!
一包高盧煙
A pack of Gauloises.
稍等一下，這兒滿是濃煙
Just a second.
lt's so smoky in here!
能不能告訴我香煙在哪？
Where are they?
l can't see a thing.
再左邊一些，再過去一點就是…
More to the left. More...
一法郎的銅板都跑哪兒了？
You need change...
算了
Forget it.
一杯摩爾
A mauresque for the young man.
一杯基爾、一杯摩爾
One kir, one mauresque
and two mint sodas.
二杯薄荷水
告訴我…這傢伙的叫聲
Was that prenuptial
or postcoital smooching?
是嘿咻前還是嘿咻後的叫聲？
你是不是天生有毛病？
Are you a congenital schmuck?
嘿咻前
- Prenuptial.
- Don't worry!
好了！別擔心
遲早會找到適合您的人
You'll find your Mr Right one day.
女人都渴望在男人懷裏入眠
All women want to sleep
on a man's shoulder.
沒一個例外！
對，這我不反對
Yes, l don't against this.
但男人喝幾杯後馬上鼾聲震耳
All men snore after a few drinks
我敏感的耳朵會受不了
and l have a musical ear.
我動過鼻腔手術不打呼
l had my nasal cavities fixed.
想不到你還挺羅曼蒂克的！
l see you're a born romantic.
看來你沒談過轟轟烈烈的戀愛
l see you've never known true love.
我若沒談過，右腿也不會跛了
l did. lt shortened my leg.
我以為你在西班牙騎馬出意外？
l thought you fell off a horse.
l did.
當年我愛上馬戲團空中飛人
l was in love with a trapeze artist.
我早該特別小心！
Stupid me!
They always drop you at the last minute.
空中飛人總在關鍵時刻鬆手
那個渾球在我進場時就放手
He dropped me just before my act.
害我連人帶馬大翻轉
lt floored me. Plus the horse,
整個人被馬壓，有夠慘
with me under it.
拿去，摩爾酒
The mauresque?
我說，世上真有一見鍾情
Still, true love does exist.
沒錯，我在吧檯做了30年
l know.
After 30 years behind a bar,
這檔事我知道的可多了
l'm an expert.
l'll even give you the recipe.
我甚至還可以教你秘訣
隨便挑二個人
Take two regulars,
讓他們以為彼此雙方有意思
mix them together and let them stew.
慢慢醞釀，絕對奏效
lt never fails.
服務生！服務生！
Excuse me!
交給我
l'll go.
你覺得大家被你害得還不夠？
Haven't you hurt enough people?
吉娜不是孩子，她能夠應付
Gina can defend herself.
我指的不是吉娜，而是喬姬
l don't mean Gina. l mean Georgette.
喬姬？
Georgette?
睜大眼，她一直想引起你興趣
Look! She craves your attention
而你眼中卻只有吉娜
but all you can see is Gina.
真可憐…看她不顧一切
Poor girl! The things she does
努力吸引你的注意力
to catch your eye!
你鐵定瞎了眼！
You really must be blind.
我走了，跟人有約，拜拜
l'm off on a date. Bye!
再見
Bye.
不知道她的新男友如何
Whoever her new one is,
總比整天拿錄音機的瘋子好
he can't be worse than that nut
with his tape recorder.
約瑟沒瘋，他只是很痛苦
Joseph's not so nutty.
He's just in pain.
艾蜜莉！他們已經分手二個月
Come on! They split up two months ago.
還每天報到，真是被虐待狂
To keep on coming here,
he must be a masochist.
別告訴我你還沒注意到…
Don't say you haven't noticed.
注意什麼？
Noticed what?
他固定坐在這兒，沒錯吧？
He always sits here, right?
嗯，沒錯
Right.
你坐下，坐下來嘛，喬姬
Sit down. Sit down, Georgette.
坐這兒，你看到什麼？
What can you see?
嗯…我的香煙攤
My cigarette counter.
沒別的？
Nothing's missing?
嗯…沒啦
No.
再看看
Make an effort.
沒啦…沒東西…看不出來
l can't see what!
讓你自己想想，晚安，喬姬
Think about it. Good night.
早安
Good moring.
八十歲瑞士老翁剛收到
Letter Arrives 30 Years Late
一封30年前寄出的情書
是登山隊攀登白朗峰時發現的
A mailbag found
by climbers on a glacier
這件郵包由馬拉寶貨機載運
on Mont Blanc was part of a cargo
這架飛機於六0年代失事墜毀
lost in a plane crash
in the late 1960's.
可惜！難得有個王妃年輕又貌美
So sad!
A young, pretty princess for once.
如果她又老又醜就活該倒霉？
lt's OK if she's old and ugly?
總是有差，那你看泰瑞莎修女…
Sure! Look at Mother Teresa.
他還是老纏著吉娜？
ls he still chasing Gina?
不，人家轉移目標了
No, he likes somebody else.
誰呀？我認識嗎？
Anyone l know?
嗯，認識…
Funny about this glacier...
白朗峰郵件的故事真有意思
這人也在"雙磨坊"?
Somebody at the Two Windmills?
嗯
Mmmm...
不是你也不是蘇珊太太…不…
Not you! Not Suzanne...
- No!
- Yes.
沒錯
看，又是這個人
There he is again.
這事不太尋常
How strange.
還有這兒…
- And here.
- ''Him again!''
又是他，里昂車站拍的
還有奧特裏茲車站3月5日
''Lyon Station.''
And here. ''March 5th, Austerlitz.''
永遠是一個表情，冷血
Always the same blank face.
我算過，總共12次，真怪
Twelve times. l counted. lt's very odd.
幹嘛定時跑遍全巴黎快照亭
Why keep taking your picture
all over town
拍完就把照片扔了？
and throw them away?
況且照片也不差
Good ones, too.
lt's like a ritual.
說不定是種儀式
也許因為他怕老
He's probably terrified of growing old.
lt's his only consolation.
這成了唯一的自我慰藉
他死了
He's dead!
死了？
Dead?
他害怕被人遺忘
He's scared of being forgotten.
所以用快照機讓人記住他
He wants to remind people of his face.
從往生世界傳真影像
Like faxing his portrait
from the afterlife.
死人害怕被人遺忘？
A dead man scared of being forgotten.
這些畫中人做法更高招
These guys here... have it made!
死了幾千幾百年
They're long dead
絕不擔心被人遺忘
but they'll never be forgotten.
拿玻璃水杯的女孩
The girl with the glass...
之所以身置事外
Maybe her thoughts
are with somebody else.
或許是因為她正掛念著某人
掛念畫裏的人？
Somebody in the picture?
不，掛念在別處遇到的男孩
More likely a boy she saw somewhere
她直覺兩人有點像
and felt an affinity with.
換句話說，她寧可想像
You mean she'd rather imagine herself
和一個不存在的人建立關係
relating to an absent person
也不願理會存在當下的人？
than build relationships
with those around her?
嗯…說不定恰恰相反
Maybe she tries hard
to fix other people's messy lives.
她正全心全力幫助別人
解決生命中的小缺憾
那她呢…她生命裏的小缺憾
What about her? Her own messy life?
誰來為她解決？
Who'll fix that?
再怎麼說，全心全力關懷他人
lt's better to help people
than a garden gnome.
總比自怨自艾來得好
你們知道嗎？肇事司機血液
The trucker had 2.8 grams
of alcohol in his blood!
居然檢測出二點八公克酒精
想到就噁心…看來，全天下
Makes me sick!
全天下不只我一個人僱用笨蛋
Talk about employing
irresponsible morons!
柯立紐先生，你忘了拔鑰匙…
- Your keys...
- Hold on, Mello.
等一下，美麗艾蜜莉
這年頭凡事急不得
Speed kills nowadays.
學學路希昂
Model yourself on Lucien.
他做起事來真是快
No radar will ever catch him
while he's working!
連蝸牛都爬得比他快，對吧？
柯立紐先生，別這樣
Shame on you, Mr Collignon.
又不是他的錯…
lt's not his fault.
你說的對，錯不在他
True, Mrs Cauchoix!
他半夜不睡全是黛妃的錯
lt's not his fault he can't sleep.
lt's Lady Di's!
你知道我在卡車裏找到什麼？
Guess what l found in the truck.
A lingerie catalog!
女用內衣郵購目錄！
他把模特兒頭剪下改成王妃頭
He'd pasted Lady Di's face
over the model's!
小姐，你是來買蘆筍
What today? Five asparagus
還是來調查街坊歷史？
or more local history?
沒事
Nothing.
"速配鑰匙"
*KEYS CUT
WHlLE YOU WAlT
謝謝！偏頭痛好多了吧？
The migraine's better?
嗯…不過晚上還是睡不著…
Yes, but my sciatica
kept me awake all night.
坐骨神經痛
lt's ages since l saw you
總之你今天看起來超有元氣
looking so good.
是嗎？
Yes?
俗話說：女人缺乏愛
''A woman without love wilts
like a flower without sun.''
宛如花朵缺乏陽光，徒然凋謝
今天的天氣有夠詭異！
Strange weather today!
我說錯話了嗎？
What's so funny?
今天每個人一進門就談天氣
You're only the 100th one to say it.
青春不再教人心慌只好閒聊
才不呢…不想胡扯
We pass the time of day
to forget how time passes.
才會談論天晴下雨
胡言亂語我也寫過不少
We do it to keep
from talking crap.
只不過沒人肯賞光出版
l write crap that nobody publishes.
始終沒談成？
- Another rejection?
- My 30th!
整整被拒絕30次
你侄子不是在寫文學評論？
lsn't your cousin a book critic?
別傻了，寫書評的都是水蛭
Forget it! Critics are like leeches,
專門吸作家的血
sucking the blood of writers.
你的書是愛情故事嗎？
ls your book a love story?
不，我的主角寫日記
lt's about a guy
who keeps a journal.
他不寫發生在他身上的事
Not about his past,
專寫未來可能遭遇的災難
but about disasters in his future.
於是他變得消沉，無所是事
So he gets depressed and does nothing.
總之就是游手好閒的傢伙
Basically, it's about a loafer.
蘇珊太太
l'll dedicate the manuscript to you.
我要把被退的手稿獻給你
是啊…他把手稿獻給你
So you'll write off his tab!
他欠的錢就一筆勾銷
我用開胃菜交換大師作品
His scribbles for my nibbles.
That's sponsorship.
這也算贊助
蘇珊太太，感謝你！
Ms. Suzanne, thank you!
這水果籃你找多久了？
What took you so long?
到底有沒有在看時間？
Look at the time!
這傢伙總是屎尿多…
Somebody peed in his mother!
"沒有你，現在的感情"
''Without you, today's emotions

"只是過去感情的硬繭"
"沒有你，現在的感情"
"只是過去感情的硬繭"
你說什麼？
What are you saying?
沒有你，現在的感情
Without you, today's emotions
would be the scurf of yesterday's.
只是過去感情的硬繭
小姐，查票
Tickets please.
最近工作情況如何？
How's work?
爸爸，你問過了
You asked me already.
嗯對…最近過得好嗎？
You're okay these days?
還不錯，有些變化
Pretty much. l feel a change...
心臟病發作兩次，外加墮胎
l had 2 heart attacks,
an abortion,
因為懷孕時吸到可卡因
did crack while l was pregnant.
除此之外都很好
Other than that, l'm fine.
好…很好
Good.
有什麼不順心的事？
Something wrong?
沒有
No, nothing.
花園裏的小矮人不見了
Your gnome's gone.
你又把它收進工具箱？
ls he back in the toolshed?
它去了莫斯科，沒說為什麼
Moscow. No explanation.
真是怪事！
lt is strange!
他可能只是想看看這世界
He wants
to see the world?
我不懂，無法理解！
l can't understand it.
失物招領：提袋&相簿
LOST
BAG

正常的女孩會冒險立刻打電話
Any normal girl would call the number,
選個地點約會還人家相簿
meet him, return the album
幾分鐘之內就可以知道
and see if her dream is viable.
值不值得繼續作夢
lt's called a reality check.
The last thing Amelie wants.
這就叫"面對現實"
不過艾蜜莉完全不信這一套
她該不會已經深陷愛河？
l say! Could she be falling in love?
"足爽軟膏"
老闆不在嗎？
Where's the boss?
噓…
Sleeping in the cauliflower.
什麼啊？

他在花椰菜堆裏睡覺
Sleeping in the cauliflower.
你要我…嗯…你需要什麼？
You want me... Want what?
請給我一張刮刮樂
A scratchcard, please.
第一次買，不知道怎麼刮
How does it work?
這樣好了，我也拿一張
Tell you what.
我們一起刮
Let's both do one together.
刮這裏，來回的刮
You scratch it here... sideways.
沒中，你呢？
Nothing. You?
也沒中，手氣不好
Me neither. Unlucky at cards...
對呀
So they say!
嗯，我該回去了
l have to get back.

嗯…滿了
你有刮腿毛嗎？
- Shaved?

你說什麼？
我問你有沒有刮腿毛
Are you shaved?
Fur pie doesn't sell.
現在的客人都討厭長毛女
華拉斯太太，你好嗎？
How's life, Mrs Wells?
當生命沒什麼好期待時…

跟著我念：柯立紐，苛薄牛

你們聽說過幕後實情嗎？
lt was Amelie, she...
她攀登白朗峰時臉部矽膠結冰
When they went up Mont Blanc...
the silicon in her face froze up.
結果整張臉腫到變形
Her face was a festering mass!
來杯熱酒，配點餅乾
Mulled wine and spice cookies.
謝謝
Thanks.
那天我對玻璃杯女孩太苛了
l was too hard on the girl
with the glass.
她和先前的男孩有再見面嗎？
Tell me about that boy she saw.
Did they meet again?
沒有，老實說，他倆興趣不同
They're into different things.
機會，好比環法自由車大賽
Luck is like the Tour de France.
等了老半天，卻一下就過去了
You wait, and it flashes past you.
所以當好時機來臨時
You have to catch it while you can.

我差點要去教堂點蠟燭祈福
l almost prayed to St Anthony!
尼諾…在嗎？
ls... Nino here now?
每星期三他都在遊樂場工作
On Wednesdays
he works at the funfair.
這樣啊…他收集相片很久了？
How long has he had this collection?
打從我介紹他來這兒上班
Since l got him the job here,
last year.
有一年了
之前他收集水泥地上的腳印
Before, he collected footprints.
He worked nights.
他原是夜班警衛利用白天拍照
ln the daytime, he took pictures
of footprints in wet cement.
專拍水泥未干誤踩的腳印
真是個怪胎…認識他的時候
He's a funny guy.
When we met, he was a Santa Claus.
他在百貨公司扮耶誕老人
專門收集怪的東西
Other things, like...
有陣子是笑聲，一聽到怪笑聲
Whenever he heard a funny laugh,
馬上錄下來
he'd tape it.
嗯…他女朋友受得了？
Gosh! Must be hard for his girlfriend!
哎呀～女人哪，他守不住
He never keeps them long.
愛作夢的人很難應付現實世界
Times are hard for dreamers.
伊娃，咖啡到底來不來？
Eva! Are those coffees coming?
我得走了，謝謝你送相簿來
Gotta go. Thanks for the album.
沒關係，我還有空

我自己拿去遊樂場給他
好吧，隨你便…
Suit yourself. The Ghost Train.
Ask for Nino Quincampoix.
你到鬼屋找尼諾岡拱波
你好，請問尼諾在嗎？
ls Nino here?
找尼諾？他了點才會出來
He doesn't get off till 7.
不能在7點前見到他嗎？
- ls there no way to see him before?
當然可以，20法郎
- Sure. 20 francs.
再見！我走了，下週三見
See you next Wednesday.
明天下午5點
5 PM tomorrow,
電話亭旁的蒙馬特旋轉木馬
Montmartre carousel.
Bring 5 francs.
請攜帶5法郎
嘿嘿嘿～
你想多知道一點，對吧？
Want to know about her?
你認識她？你看過她？
- You know her?
- You bet!
當然看過
她把我們放進襯衫口袋
She put us in her shirt pocket.
貼著她的胸部！
Next to her breast!
那…她漂亮嗎？
- ls she pretty?
- Not bad.
嗯…不錯看
挺美的
- Beautiful.
- No, pretty.
不對，她是漂亮！
不不不，是美麗！
- Beautiful!
- Pretty.
漂亮！
她到底想怎樣？
- What does she want from me?
- She's broke.
她破產了她想交易一下
說不定她也收集快拍照
She wants a reward for the album.
沒錯，我們這組她已經有了
Or else she collects photos, too.
她要換你的獨眼龍墨鏡
She wants to trade us
for a one-eyed man with glasses!
唬你的啦，笨！她愛上你了！
No, you dope! She's in love.
但我連她是誰都不曉得
- l don't even know her.
- You do.
你一定認識她
什麼時候？
Since when?
本來就認識…在夢中…
Since always. ln your dreams.
好的…拿塑膠袋的！電話
You! Man with the plastic bag!
lt's for you.
找我，謝謝，喂？
For me.
Thanks, hello?
岡先生，請遵照藍色箭頭
Follow the blue arrows,
Mr Quincampoix.
先生，手指指向天
The fool looks at a finger
that points at the sky.
只有呆瓜才盯著手指看
嘿！喂？
Hello?
岡拱波先生
Mr Quincampoix.
l know the stranger in the pictures.
我知道誰是快照亭神秘客
他是鬼！我們看不見
He's a ghost. He's invisible!
只有底片感光層抓得住他
He only appears
when the film is developed.
每當年輕女孩拍快照時
When a girl has her photo taken,
他就在她們耳邊發出：嗚～
he goes ''Wooo!'' in her ear
輕輕撫摸她們的脖子
while he fondles her neck.
所以他才被拍下來
That's how he got caught,
Mr Quincampoix!
喂…你到底是誰？
Who are you?
翻到51頁
Page 51.
你想…認識…我嗎？
DO YOU WANT TO MEET ME?
你們聽：
Listen to this:
6歲小男孩趁著父母熟睡
''Boy of 6, ''while parents sleep, drives off
深夜騎著踏板車上路
''in a pedal car.
在德國公路上被人發現
''Found on a highway in Germany,
小男孩告訴警察：
''he told the police
he wanted to see the stars.''
他只是想去看星星
好美啊！
Ain't life beautiful, though?
現在只差沒有人一見鍾情
Love. The only bug
she hadn't caught!
這個嘛…沒人能倖免
- Nobody's immune.
- lt gives me a break.
起碼我已經解脫了
不過，愛情讓人幣申清氣爽
Love's a great beautician.
她長怎樣子？
What's she like?
Tall, small? Fair, dark?
高的？矮的？金髮？棕髮？
嗯…中等身高
Let's say... average height.
不是矮冬瓜也不是長頸鹿
Not a dwarf or a giraffe. Normal.
同類型裏算漂亮，髮色很難講
Pretty, for her type.
As for fair or dark, it's hard to say.
總之不是紅髮，還有…
She wasn't a redhead. Unless...
算了算了
Forget it.
我記得她假裝順口問問
l remember she casually asked
about your girlfriend.
你有沒有女朋友
我說你對這不感興趣
l said you weren't interested, right?
這答案不錯吧？
And?
你真的這樣說？
You didn't!
你對她幹嘛那麼感興趣？
What do you care?
You don't even know her.
你連她是誰都不曉得
所以才…神秘
- Exactly. lt's the mystery.
- You won't find mystery here.
抱歉，你從我這兒找不到答案
我要買半公斤桃子
A pound of nectarines.
這些給你，又多又漂亮
These ones here
are the prettiest.
他真是個藝術家，15天來
Trust him. He's an artist!
每晚帶著一堆滯銷貨出門
He goes home
with a ton of unsold stock.
我還以為他拿去轉賣發財
What for? ls he stewing a pig?
根本不是！原來他去學畫
No sir! He's studying art!
他白天賣蔥，晚上畫大頭菜
Sells leeks all day long
and paints turnips all night!
對於這種呆瓜我有什麼辦法？
The boy's a useless vegetable!
稱職的提詞人躲在地窗後
With a prompter in each cellar window
whispering comebacks,
教你如何語出犀利
害羞的人要這樣才能反唇相譏
shy people
would have the last laugh.
至少…你不會變成蔬菜
At least you'll never be a vegetable!
Even artichokes have hearts!
想變蔬菜也得有顆心！
至少…你不會變成蔬菜
