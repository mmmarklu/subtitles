People always ask me
if I know Tyler Durden.
總是有人問我認不認識泰勒 德頓
還有三分鐘，精彩時刻就要到了
Three minutes.
This is it. Ground zero.
一切重新回到原來的起點
Do you have a speech for the occasion?
你想說幾句話紀念這個偉大的時刻嗎？
嘴裏含著槍，只能支支唔唔的
With a gun barrel between your teeth,
you speak only in vowels.
I can't think of anything.
我還是沒想到要說什麼
我差點忘了泰勒控制著破壞行動
For a second, I forget about
Tyler's controlled demolition thing
and I wonder how clean that gun is.
不知道那把槍有多髒
It's getting exciting now.
越來越刺激了
俗話說，人們總會傷害他所愛的人
That old thing,
how you always hurt the one you love.
其實人們也會愛上他所傷害的人
Well, it works both ways.
We have front-row seats
for this theater of mass destruction.
這齣爆破戲，我們坐在最前排
大破壞計劃準備炸毀12棟樓
The Demolitions Committee
of Project Mayhem
wrapped the foundations
of 12 buildings with explosives.
2 分鐘後，炸彈就會被引爆
In two minutes,
primary charges will blow base charges
好幾條街都會處於悶燒的狀態
and a few blocks will be reduced
to smouldering rubble.
我知道這些，是因為泰勒他知道這些
I know this because Tyler knows this.
還有兩分鐘半，想想我們過去的成就吧
Two and a half.
Think of everything we've accomplished.
突然間我終於明白了
Suddenly I realize that all of this,
the gun, the bombs, the revolution,
槍，炸彈，革命…
都跟瑪拉辛格這女人有關
has got something to do
with a girl named Marla Singer.
你好，我是鮑伯
鮑伯有大奶奶
Bob. Bob had bitch tits.
This was a support group
for men with testicular cancer.
「永遠是男人」
這是睪丸癌患者的安撫團體
The big moosie slobbering all over me,
that was Bob.
這個把我抱了個滿懷的就是鮑伯
We're still men.
我們都還是男人
沒錯，我們是男人
Yes, we're men.
鮑伯8個月前切除了睪丸
Men is what we are.
Bob had had his testicles removed.
Then hormone therapy.
接著做荷爾蒙治療
He developed bitch tits because
his testosterone was too high
睪丸激素太高，刺激雌激素
所以他長了奶子
and his body upped the oestrogen.
這裏很適合我
- That was where I fit...
- They'll have to drain my pecs again.
他們又要切開我胸部減胸了
..between those huge sweating tits
頭被埋在這麼大的奶子中間
that hung enormous,
the way you'd think of God's as big.
不禁認為上帝的胸部也很壯觀
OK, you cry now.
換你哭了
No, wait. Back up. Let me start earlier.
先等等，讓我從頭說起
6個月來我都沒法閉眼
For six months, I couldn't sleep.
I couldn't sleep.
失眠癥讓我感受不到真實
With insomnia, nothing's real.
Everything's far away.
一切都很虛幻
Everything's a copy of a copy
事情都成了相同的拷貝
of a copy.
When deep space exploration ramps up,
it'll be the corporations that name everything.
探索外太空會找到一堆企業
IBM星球
The IBM Stellar Sphere.
微軟銀河系
The Microsoft Galaxy.
The Planet Starbucks.
星巴剋星球
I need you out of town this week
to cover some red flags.
我要你到外地去處理些疑難雜癥
今天一定是星期二
It must have been Tuesday.
He had on his cornflower blue tie.
因為他繫著藍色矢車菊領帶
我暫時放下手頭的工作？
You want me to deprioritize my reports
until you advise of a status upgrade?
先處理這些事件
這是機票折價券
如果遇到臨時狀況再通知我
Prioritize these. Here's your flight coupons.
Call me if there's any snags.
他很有精神
He was full of pep.
Must have had his grande latte enema.
一定是喝了不少咖啡
Like so many others, I had become
a slave to the Ikea nesting instinct.
我也是個迷上傢俱裝潢的人
Yes. I'd like to order
我要訂傢俱防塵腳套
the Erika Pekkari dust ruffles.
請等一下
- Please hold.
- Anything clever,
要是看到陰陽形狀的咖啡桌
like a coffee table in the shape of a yin-yang,
I had to have it.
我就一定要買到
整組個人咖啡杯
The Klipsk personal office unit.
家用固定腳踏車
The Hovetrekke home exerbike.
綠色條紋的高級沙發
Or the Ohamshab sofa
with the Strinne green stripe pattern.
Even the Ryslampa wire lamps of
environmentally-friendly unbleached paper.
還有裝著再生紙燈罩的電燈
我翻著產品目錄思考著…
I'd flip through catalogues and wonder
哪種餐具能表現我的個人風格？
"What kind of dining set
defines me as a person?"
I had it all. Even the glass dishes
with tiny bubbles and imperfections,
連有瑕疵的盤子我都買了
因為它們是純手工製作的
proof that they were crafted by the honest,
hard-working, indigenous peoples of...
請再稍等片刻
- Please hold.
- ..wherever.
管他呢
反正我已經等很久了
We used to read pornography.
以前我們看色情圖片尋找刺激
Now it was the Horchow collection.
現在是看產品目錄
失眠癥不會死人的
- No. You can't die of insomnia.
- What about narcolepsy?
嗜睡癥呢？
I nod off, I wake up in strange places.
突然睡著，在陌生的地方醒來
I have no idea how I got there.
你得放鬆心情
- You need to lighten up.
- Can you please just give me something?
給我些安眠藥吧？
Red and blue Tuinals, lipstick-red Seconals...
紅紅藍藍的安眠藥
不行，你需要健康自然的睡眠
No. You need healthy, natural sleep.
吃點拔地麻根，多做運動
Chew some valerian root
and get more exercise.
Hey, come on.
別走嘛，我很痛苦啊
- I'm in pain.
- You wanna see pain?
星期二到教堂去見識見識真正的痛苦
Swing by First Methodist, Tuesday nights.
看看那些得了睪丸癌的人
See the guys with testicular cancer.
那才叫痛苦
That's pain.
我一直想要三個孩子
I always wanted three kids...
two boys and a girl.
兩男一女
Mindy wanted two girls and a boy.
敏蒂要兩女一男
我倆意見一直不合
We never could agree on anything.
她上禮拜生了第一個寶寶
Well, I... She...
She had her first child last week.
是女孩
A girl.
With... With her... With her new husband.
是她新任丈夫的
Fuck!
謝天謝地
Thank God, you know...
I'm glad for her.
我真為她高興
因為那是應該的
She deserves...
Everyone, let's thank Thomas
for sharing himself with us.
謝謝湯瑪斯與我們分享
Thank you, Thomas.
謝謝湯瑪斯…
I look around this room,
and I see a lot of courage.
我看到各位的勇氣
也帶給我力量
And that gives me strength.
We give each other strength.
我們互相給予彼此力量
It's time for the one-on-ones.
一對一的時間到了
以湯瑪斯的例子為準則
So let's all of us follow Thomas's example
and really open ourselves up.
敞開心胸吧
請各自尋找搭檔
Could you find a partner?
And this is how I met the big moosie.
我就是這樣認識大奶奶的
他的眼睛早就熱淚盈眶
His eyes already shrink-wrapped in tears.
膝蓋摩擦著，小碎步走向我
Knees together. Those awkward little steps.
我是鮑伯
- My name is Bob.
- Bob?
鮑伯
Bob had been a champion bodybuilder.
他曾是健美先生
You know that chest expansion programme
on late-night TV?
你知道晚間的健胸節目嗎？
那是他提出的主意
That was his idea.
我曾經使用禁藥
I was a juicer.
就是類固醇
You know, using steroids?
Diabonal and
戴伯諾
威斯特駱

Oh, they use that on racehorses,
for Christ sakes.
那是拿來打在賽馬身上的
我破產了，離婚了
And now I'm bankrupt.
I'm divorced.
我的兩個孩子
My two grown kids
他們甚至不肯回電話給我
won't even return my phone calls.
Strangers with this kind of honesty
make me go a big, rubbery one.
這麼坦白的陌生人，讓我想哭
Go ahead,... Cornelius.
沒關係，柯納裏斯
You can cry.
好好的哭一場吧
接著奇跡發生了
And then... something happened.
I let go.
我不再壓抑
That's really good.
不顧一切
Lost in oblivion.
Dark and silent and complete.
感到黑暗，沉默和完整
我找到了自由
I found freedom.
Losing all hope was freedom.
拋開所有希望就是自由
沒關係
It's OK.
Babies don't sleep this well.
初生的嬰兒都沒有我睡的沉
後來我就上癮了
I became addicted.
「酒精中毒，貪食癥團體」
「如何對抗肺結核」
如果我不說話
If I didn't say anything
別人都會以為我快死了
people always assumed the worst.
「遠離病毒」
他們哭得越兇
They cried harder... then I cried harder.
我就哭得越兇
「皮膚癌，腎臟癌，胃癌」
打開那扇綠門，你的心門
Now we're going to open the green door,
the heart chakra...
I wasn't really dying.
我沒有絕癥
也沒有癌癥或是寄生菌
I wasn't host to cancer or parasites.
我只是一個小小的中心
I was the warm little center
that the life of this world crowded around.
想像有一道治療你的白光
想像有一道治療你的白光
Imagine your pain
as a white ball of healing light.
那道光在你身上游移，治療
It moves over your body, healing you.
Now keep this going. Remember to breathe
繼續冥想，別忘了呼吸
走向房間的後門
and step forward
through the back door of the room.
Where does it lead?
那道門通往哪裏？
到你的洞裏去
To your cave.
Step forward
into your cave.
走進你的洞裏
That's right.
很好
You're going deeper into your cave.
走進洞的深處
你會在那裏找到你的精神動物
And you're going to find
your power animal.
Slide.
滑啊
我每晚都會死一次
Every evening I died.
可是又重生一次
And every evening I was born again.
復活過來
Resurrected.
鮑伯以為我的睪丸也被切除了
Bob loved me because he thought
my testicles were removed too.
我靠著他的奶子，準備哭泣
Being there, pressed against his tits,
ready to cry.
這簡直是我的假期
This was my vacation.
And she
但是她…
ruined everything.
卻把一切都給毀了
這是癌癥的吧？
This is cancer, right?
This chick, Marla Singer,
瑪拉辛格根本沒有睪丸癌
did not have testicular cancer.
她是騙子
She was a liar.
她根本沒有病
She had no diseases at all.
我在血癌團體課曾見過她
I had seen her at Free And Clear,
my blood parasites group, Thursdays.
還有我的鐮狀細胞貧血癥團體
Then at Hope,
my bimonthly sickle-cell circle.
還有「把握今天」
And again, at Seize The Day,
my tuberculosis, Friday night.
星期五晚上的肺結核團體
Marla,
瑪拉
the big tourist.
這個到處都去的人
Her lie reflected my lie.
她的謊言反射出我的謊言
突然間我沒有感覺了
And suddenly, I felt nothing.
I couldn't cry. So once again,
我哭不出來了
所以再一次的
I couldn't sleep.
我睡不著了
Next group, after guided meditation,
下一節課，在冥想結束後
after we open our heart chakras,
when it's time to hug,
我要抓著她的手大喊
I'm gonna grab that bitch,
Marla Singer, and scream.
「瑪拉，你這個騙子，你給我滾」
Marla, you liar!
You big tourist, I need this! Now, get out!
I hadn't slept in four days.
我4天沒睡了
We'll just let that dry...
得失眠癥的人無法真正入睡
When you have insomnia,
you're never really asleep.
也沒有清醒的時刻
And you're never really awake.
To begin tonight's communion,
今晚由克蘿伊替我們開場白
Chloe would like to say a few words.
對了，克蘿伊
Oh, yeah. Chloe.
Chloe looked the way Meryl Streep's skeleton
would look if you made it walk around
她是那種非常有親和力的人
being extra nice to everybody.
嗨，我還活著
Well, I'm still here.
可是不知道會活多久
But I don't know for how long.
沒有人能給我正確答案
That's as much certainty
as anyone can give me.
But I've got some good news.
但我有個好消息
I no longer have any fear of death.
我不害怕死亡了
可是我現在很孤獨
But... I am in a pretty lonely place.
沒有人願意跟我做愛
No-one will have sex with me.
I'm so close to the end,
and all I want is to get laid for the last time.
我快死了，我想做最後一次愛
I have pornographic movies
in my apartment,
我家裏有A片
還有潤滑劑和春藥

謝謝你，克蘿伊
我們謝謝克蘿伊
Everyone, let's thank Chloe.
Thank you, Chloe.
謝謝，克蘿伊
我們準備冥想吧
Now, let's ready ourselves
for guided meditation.
You're standing at the entrance of your cave.
你站在山洞的入口
You step inside your cave and you walk...
進入山洞往裏面走
If I did have a tumor, I'd name it Marla.
瑪拉猶如我的癌癥
就像長在嘴邊的爛疽一般
Marla.
The scratch on the roof of your mouth
that would heal if you could stop tonguing it.
不去舔就不會惡化，但沒辦法不去舔
But you can't.
再走深入一點
在你走的同時
感受身邊治療的力量
..deeper into your cave as you walk.
You feel a healing energy all around you.
去找你的精神動物
Now find your power animal.
Slide.
滑啊
OK. Let's partner up.
開始分組吧
選一個今晚對你很特別的人
Pick someone special to you tonight.
我要跟你談談
Hey.
- We need to talk.
- Sure.
好啊
- I'm onto you.
- What?
我知道你的底細
什麼？
你是假的，你根本不會死
Yeah. You're a faker. You're not dying.
Sorry?
你說什麼？
In the Tibetan-philosophy, Sylvia-Plath
sense of the word, I know we're all dying.
某種觀點看來，我們都會死
可是你跟克蘿伊的情況不同
- But you're not dying the way Chloe is.
- So?
怎樣？
So you're a tourist.
你什麼團體都參加
I've seen you. I saw you at melanoma,
I saw you at tuberculosis.
我見過你
你參加過黑腫瘤課，肺結核課
I saw you at testicular cancer!
還有睪丸癌團體
你演練過了對吧？
I saw you practising this.
- Practising what?
- Telling me off.
演練什麼？
跟我對質的話啊
結果與你預期一樣嗎？
Is it going as well as you hoped,... Rupert?
陸波？
I'll expose you.
我要揭露你的事
去啊，我也會揭露你的事
Go ahead. I'll expose you.
好了，大家一起發洩吧
Come together. Let yourselves cry.
你為什麼要這樣子？
Oh, God. Why are you doing this?
這比看電影便宜，還有咖啡喝
It's cheaper than a movie
and there's free coffee.
這是很重要的
Look, this is important.
These are my groups.
那些是屬於我的團體
I've been coming for over a year.
我參加這些團體1年了
- Why do you do it?
- I don't know.
你又是為什麼？
快死的人，說話特別有份量
When people think you're dying,
they listen to you instead of...
Instead of waiting for their turn to speak.
別人不敢打斷
沒錯
Yeah. Yeah.
Share yourself... completely.
完全分享你的事
Look, you don't want to get into this.
別繼續了，你會上癮的
- It becomes an addiction.
- Really?
真的？
I'm not kidding. I can't cry
if another faker is present, and I need this.
我說真的
我需要這些課程好好哭泣
請你另覓他處
You gotta find somewhere else to go.
Candystripe a cancer ward.
It's not my problem.
那是你的問題，可不關我的事
No, wait a second. Hold on.
等一下，別走
We'll split up the week, OK?
我們平分好了
You take lymphoma and tuberculosis.
淋巴瘤和肺結核給你
肺結核給你，我太愛抽煙了
You take tuberculosis.
My smoking doesn't go over at all.
好
OK. Good. Fine.
Testicular cancer should be no contest.
睪丸癌沒有爭議吧？
我比你有資格去
Technically, I have more right to be there.
You still have your balls.
因為你還有睪丸
- You're kidding.
- I dunno. Am I?
你在開玩笑吧？
你看像嗎？
No. No.
你要什麼？
- What do you want?
- I'll take the parasites.
寄生菌
You can't have both.
Take the blood parasites.
血液寄生菌給你好了
我要腦寄生菌
我也要腦寄生菌
- I want brain parasites.
- I'll take the blood but I want brain dementia.
我要
腦部分很多區，你不能通通去
- I want that.
- You can't have the whole brain.
你分到四個，我只分到兩個
So far, you have four. I only have two.
好吧，寄生菌都給你
OK. Take both the parasites. They're yours.
我們兩都各分到三個了
Now we both have three...
Hey! You left half your clothes.
你的衣服掉了
- What, are you selling those?
- Yes!
你賣髒衣服？
沒錯，我是賣衣服的
I'm selling some clothes!
我們各三天，第七天呢？
So! We each have three. That's six.
What about the seventh day?
I want bowel cancer.
我要腸癌
她也下過功夫
The girl had done her homework.
我要腸癌
No. No. I want bowel cancer.
That's your favorite too?
那也是你的最愛？跟我分吧？
- Tried to slip it by me, eh?
- Look, we'll split it.
好，你每個月的單數周去
Take the first and third Sunday.
好
Deal.
Looks like this is goodbye.
看來要道別了
沒什麼大不了的
Let's not make a big thing out of it.
這當然很大不了
How's this for not making a big thing?
Hey, Marla!
瑪拉
Marla!
Maybe we should exchange numbers.
我們交換電話號碼吧
Should we?
要嗎？
或許有時會想換時間啊
- We might wanna switch nights.
- OK.
好
This is how I met Marla Singer.
我就是這樣認識瑪拉辛格的
瑪拉的哲學是，她隨時都會死
Marla's philosophy of life
was that she might die at any moment.
悲慘的是，她一直都沒死
The tragedy, she said, was that she didn't.
你沒寫名字，你是誰？
It doesn't have your name!
Who are you? Cornelius? Rupert?
柯裏納斯？陸波？
崔維斯？
Travis? Any of the stupid names
you give each night?
到底是哪個蠢名字？
You wake up at SeaTac.
我在西雅圖機場上醒來
SFO. LAX.
或舊金山機場
或洛城機場
You wake up at O'Hare.
或歐哈機場
Dallas Fort Worth.
或達拉斯機場
或巴華機場
BWI.
太平洋，山區，或中央時區
Pacific. Mountain. Central.
Lose an hour. Gain an hour.
有時多一小時，有時少一小時
兩小時前要辦登機手續
The check-in for that flight
isn't for another two hours, sir.
你的生命一分一分的消逝
This is your life,
and it's ending one minute at a time.
在哈柏國際機場醒來
You wake up at Air Harbor International.
若在不同時間於不同地點醒來
If you wake up at a different time,
in a different place,
你會變成不同的人嗎？
could you wake up as a different person?
Everywhere I travel,
我不管到哪，都有瑣事
tiny life.
一包糖，一包奶精
Single-serving sugar and cream.
一包奶油
Single pat of butter.
方型的微波爐餐
The microwave cordon bleu hobby kit.
Shampoo-conditioner combos.
旅行用洗髮精組
簡單的牙刷牙膏，小肥皂
Sample-package mouthwash.
Tiny bars of soap.
The people I meet on each flight,
我在每架飛機上遇到的人
也都是一面之緣的朋友
they're single-serving friends.
在起飛和降落前，我們分享一點時間
Between takeoff and landing,
we have our time together.
That's all we get.
Welcome!
歡迎
總之時間一到，大家都翹辮子
On a long enough time line,
the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.
我是一名汽車召回協調員
我的工作就是使用一些公式
I was a recall coordinator.
My job was to apply the formula.
The infant went through the windshield.
那個嬰兒就是從擋風玻璃這地方被甩出來的
這個三分
A new car built by my company
leaves somewhere traveling at 60mph.
這是我們公司的新車款，時速60英里
後輪差速排檔鎖死了
The rear differential locks up.
有個孩子的牙套留在後座的煙灰缸上
The teenager's braces
are stuck to the ashtray.
Might make a good anti-smoking ad.
這個畫面可以做戒煙廣告
The car crashes and burns
with everyone trapped inside.
車子撞擊時，人都還在車內
需要回收這款車型嗎？
Now, should we initiate a recall?
這爸爸一定很胖
The father must have been huge.
你看座位上被燒的肥油痕跡
See where the fat burned to the seat?
The polyester shirt?
很有現代藝術感
Very modern art.
將這輛車的序號，A
Take the number of vehicles in the field, A.
乘以故障機率，B
Multiply it by the probable rate of failure, B.
再乘以官司需要的費用，C
Multiply the result by
the average out-of-court settlement, C.
A乘以B乘以C等於X
A x B x C
equals X.
若X小於善後處理費用的話
If X is less than the cost of a recall,
我們就不做車型的回收
we don't do one.
Are there a lot of these kinds of accidents?
這種意外很多嗎？
多到你無法相信
You wouldn't believe.
你是哪家汽車公司的？
Which car company do you work for?
A major one.
很大的那家
Every time the plane banked too sharply
on takeoff or landing,
只要飛機搖晃的厲害時
我都祈禱能墜機或是爆炸
什麼都行
I prayed for a crash or a midair collision.
Anything.
Life insurance pays off triple
if you die on a business trip.
出差保險理賠是一般的三倍
"If you are seated in an emergency exit row
「如果您的座位是在緊急出口的旁邊」
「而且您覺得自己無法承擔
或不願承擔安全指引卡所列明的義務」
and would be unable or unwilling
to perform the duties
listed on the safety card, please
ask a flight attendant to reseat you."
「請要求機組人員為您安排另一個座位」
It's a lot of responsibility.
你的責任很重呢？
Wanna switch seats?
你想要換位子嗎？
我沒辦法勝任那種工作
No. I'm not sure
I'm the man for that particularjob.
3萬英尺高的緊急出口
An exit-door procedure at 30,000ft.
還有什麼安全可言
The illusion of safety.
Yeah. I guess so.
就是說啊
You know why
they put oxygen masks on planes?
你知道機上為什麼有氧氣罩？
- So you can breathe.
- Oxygen gets you high.
讓我們呼吸啊
是因為氧氣讓人興奮
緊急狀況時，人會大口呼吸
In a catastrophic emergency,
you take giant panic breaths.
吸了氧氣會有安定感
Suddenly you become euphoric, docile.
You accept your fate.
就會面對現實
上面都有寫
It's all right here.
Emergency water landing, 600mph.
緊急水上降落，時速6百英里
乘客每個都臉色慘白
Blank faces. Calm as Hindu cows.
你剛才說的…
That's...
那些理論很有趣
That's an interesting theory.
你是幹什麼的？
- What do you do?
- What do you mean?
什麼意思？
What do you do for a living?
你是幹什麼工作的？
Why? So you can pretend you're interested?
幹嘛？
你會假裝你有興趣嗎？
OK.
你的笑聲裏帶著絕望
You have
a kind of sick desperation in your laugh.
我們的公事包一模一樣
We have the exact same briefcase.
Soap.
肥皂
- Sorry?
- I make and I sell soap.
我製造、銷售肥皂
The yardstick of civilization.
這些可是文明的產物
And this is how I met...
我就是這樣認識了…
泰勒德頓
Tyler Durden.
Did you know if you mix gasoline and
frozen orange juice, you can make napalm?
等量的汽油和凍柳橙汁混合後
可以做成汽油彈喔，知道嗎？
不知道，這是真的嗎？
- No, I did not. Is that true?
- That's right.
真的
用家裏的小東西就能做炸彈
One can make all kinds of explosives
with simple household items.
真的？
- Really?
- If one was so inclined.
只要你想做
你是我的一次性朋友裏頭最有趣的一個
Tyler, you are by far the most interesting
single-serving friend I have ever met.
飛機上所有東西都是一次性的
- Everything on a plane is single-serving...
- Oh, I get it. Very clever.
我聽懂了，真聰明
Thank you.
謝謝
How's it working out for you?
那樣對你有什麼好處？
- What?
- Being clever?
什麼？
聰明啊
Great.
這很好啊
那就繼續保持吧
Keep it up, then. Right up.
我該面向著你出去
還是屁股向著你出去才有禮貌
A question of etiquette.
As I pass, do I give you the ass or the crotch?
我會跟泰勒住是有原因的
How I came to live with Tyler is...
Airlines have this policy
about vibrating luggage.
因為航空公司討厭震動的行李
有滴答聲嗎？
- Was it ticking?
- Throwers know modern bombs don't tick.
丟手說現代炸彈是無聲的
丟手？
- Sorry, throwers?
- Baggage handlers.
處理行李的人
But when a suitcase vibrates,
只要行李會震動，就得報警
the throwers have got to call the police.
我的行李會震動？
- My suitcase was vibrating?
- Nine times out of ten
這情況十之八九是電動刮鬍刀
it's an electric razor.
But... every once in a while
可是有時候是…
人造男性生殖震動器
it's a dildo.
那東西沒有列入我們的禁品
It's company policy never to imply
ownership in the event of a dildo.
法條只說「人造男性生殖器」
We have to use the indefinite article,
a dildo, never
而非「你的人造男性生殖器」
your dildo.
我沒有…
I don't own...
I had everything in that suitcase.
My CK shirts.
我所有的東西都在裏面
我的凱文克萊襯衫
My DKNYshoes. My AX ties.
我的DKNY鞋子
我的AX領帶
Never mind.
算了
Hey! That's my car!
Home was a condo on the 15th floor
我的公寓是15樓的小窩
of a filing cabinet
for widows and professionals.
The walls were solid concrete.
四面都是水泥牆
水泥牆可以抵擋鄰居的噪音
A foot of concrete is important
when your next-door neighbor
has to watch game shows at full volume.
也能防止火山爆發時弄壞傢俱
Or when a blast of debris
that used to be your personal effects
blows out of your windows
and sails flaming into the night.
將傢俱甩出，燒得精光
這種事有可能發生的
I suppose these things happen.
上面什麼都沒有了
There's... nothing up there.
You can't go into the unit. Police orders.
你不能進去，這是警方的命令
你有人可以聯絡嗎？
Do you have somebody you can call?
How embarrassing.
真丟臉
A houseful of condiments and no food.
房裏只有調味料，沒有東西吃
「瑪拉辛格」
The police later told me
the pilot light might have gone out
警方說可能是爐火火苗熄了
所以瓦斯外洩
letting out just a little bit of gas.
瓦斯慢慢充滿房裏
That gas could have filled the condo.
好幾天來慢慢累積
1700 square feet with high ceilings
for days and days.
後來碰到冰箱壓縮機啟動…
Then the refrigerator's compressor
could have clicked on.
Yeah?
喂？
我聽到你的呼吸…
I can hear you breathing...
If you ask me now,
I couldn't tell you why I called him.
「佩波街肥皂公司」
我也不知道為什麼打電話找他
喂？
- Hello?
- Who's this?
你是哪位？
泰勒嗎？
- Tyler?
- Who is this?
你是誰？
我們在飛機上見過
We met... We met on the airplane.
公事包一模一樣的
We had the same suitcase?
The clever guy?
那個聰明人？
Oh, yeah. Right.
對了
我剛才也打過
I called a second ago. There was no answer.
沒有人接電話，我打公用電話
- I'm at a payphone.
- Yeah, I *69'd you. I never pick up my phone.
我從不接電話，只回拔電話
怎麼了？
So what's up?
說了你也不會相信
Well.
You're not gonna believe this.
You know, it could be worse.
這還算好，萬一被女人割老二
A woman could cut off your penis
while you sleep and toss it out of a car.
老二還被她丟到別人車上才慘
那種事也可能發生
There's always that. I don't know.
只是每次買傢俱時都會想
When you buy furniture,
you tell yourself, that's it.
「這是我最後一次買沙發」
That's the last sofa I'll need.
「我要好好保護這套沙發」
Whatever happens,
that sofa problem is handled.
我什麼都有，還有高級音響
I had it all.
I had a stereo that was very decent.
A wardrobe that was getting very respectable.
漂亮的衣櫃
不用多久我就什麼都有了
I was close to being complete.
可是現在卻一無所有
- Shit, man. Now it's all gone.
- All gone.
一無所有
All gone.
一無所有
Do you know what a duvet is?
你聽過鴨絨墊子嗎？
- A comforter.
- It's a blanket.
棉被？
是毯子
Just a blanket. Why do guys
like you and I know what a duvet is?
我們一定要知道鴨絨墊子嗎？
我們一定要字字斟酌嗎？
Is this essential to our survival
in the hunter-gatherer sense?
No.
不用
What are we, then?
那你和我算什麼？
消費者啊
I dunno. Consumers.
對，我們就是消費者
Right. We're consumers.
我們滿腦子想的都是物質
We are by-products of a lifestyle obsession.
我不關心兇殺案和貧窮問題
Murder, crime, poverty.
These things don't concern me.
我只關心名人雜誌
What concerns me are celebrity magazines,
5百個頻道的電視
television with 500 channels,
some guy's name on my underwear. Rogaine.
我內褲上印著誰的名字
生發劑，威爾鋼，減肥藥
Viagra. Olestra.
還有萬能的瑪莎
- Martha Stewart.
- Fuck Martha Stewart.
去她的瑪莎
瑪莎所造就的世界慢慢沉淪
She's polishing the brass on the Titanic.
It's all going down.
去你的沙發和綠條紋沙發佈
So fuck off with your sofa units
and Strinne green stripe patterns.
I say never be complete.
不要讓自己什麼都有
I say stop being perfect.
不要做完美的人
我們要進化，水來土掩
I say let's evolve.
Let the chips fall where they may.
那只是我的意見，也許我錯了
But that's me, and I could be wrong.
也許你很重視那些東西
Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.
It's just stuff. Not a tragedy...
只是一堆身外物，無所謂
You did lose a lot of versatile solutions
for modern living.
你的確損失不少現代傢俱
Fuck, you're right. I don't smoke.
沒錯，你說得對。  哦不，我不抽煙
我的保險會賠償的
My insurance is probably gonna cover it, so...
What?
怎麼了？
The things you own end up owning you.
你已經被物質奴役了
隨便你吧
Do what you like, man.
Oh, it's late.
很晚了
- Hey, thanks for the beer.
- Yeah, man.
謝謝你請我喝酒
不客氣
I should find a hotel.
我要找家飯店才行
What?
什麼？
What?
什麼？
飯店？
- A hotel?
- Yeah.
是啊
開口問嘛
- Just ask, man.
- What are you talking about?
你說什麼？
Oh, God. Three pitchers of beer
and you still can't ask.
都喝三杯酒了，還不敢問
What?
什麼？
You called me
because you needed a place to stay.
你找我是因為你沒地方住
我不是…
- Oh, hey. No, no, no.
- Yes, you did. So just ask.
就是，開口說就是了
Cut the foreplay and just ask, man.
別裝了，直接說吧
會給你帶來麻煩嗎？
Would... Would that be a problem?
你開口問會有什麼麻煩嗎？
Is it a problem for you to ask?
我可以到你家借住嗎？
- Can I stay at your place?
- Yeah.
可以
Thanks.
謝了
我要你幫我一個忙
- I want you to do me a favor.
- Yeah, sure.
什麼忙？
用力打我
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
什麼？
What?
我要你用盡全力打我
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
Let me tell you a little bit about Tyler Durden.
我先介紹泰勒德頓
他是個夜貓子
Tyler was a night person.
我們睡覺的時候他卻在工作
While the rest of us slept, he worked.
他兼職做放映師
He had one part-time job as a projectionist.
電影分好幾卷，並非一捲到底
A movie doesn't come all on one big reel.
It comes on a few.
需要有人準確的接上兩卷膠卷
Someone has to switch the projectors
at the exact moment
that one reel ends and the next one begins.
你會在右上方看到小點點
You can see little dots come into
the upper right corner of the screen.
我們的行話叫做香煙烙點
In the industry, we call them cigarette burns.
That's the cue for a changeover.
那就是換下一卷的記號
他在電影進行中換放映機
He flips the projectors, movie keeps
going and the audience has no idea.
觀眾毫不知情
怎麼會有人做這種爛工作？
Why would anyone want this shitjob?
Because it affords him
interesting opportunities.
因為這樣他就能做怪
把色情電影片段放入普級片中
Like splicing a frame of pornography
into family films.
所以在看名人配音的卡通片時
So when the snooty cat and the courageous
dog with the celebrity voices first meet,
就會發現泰勒的傑作
that's when you'll catch a flash
of Tyler's contribution to the film.
Nobody knows that they saw it but they did.
觀眾根本沒察覺到自己看到了
Nice, big cock.
好大的屌
泰勒的動作快極了
Even a hummingbird
couldn't catch Tyler at work.
他有時也在大飯店兼作侍者
Tyler also works sometimes as a banquet
waiter at the luxurious Pressman hotel.
He was the guerrilla terrorist
of the food service industry.
他是服務業的恐怖份子
別看我，我會尿不出來
Do not watch. I cannot go when you watch.
他有時會在甜點上放屁
Apart from seasoning the lobster bisque,
he farted on meringues,
在萵苣火鍋裏擤鼻涕
至於蘑菇湯上面的奶油…
and as for the cream of mushroom soup...
告訴他們啊
Go ahead, tell 'em.
你們猜到了吧
You get the idea.
你要我打你？
- You just want me to hit you?
- Come on. Do me this one favor.
幫我一下嘛
為什麼？
- Why?
- I don't know. Never been in a fight. You?
不知道，我沒打過架，你呢？
沒有，沒打過架很好啊
- No. But that's a good thing.
- You can't know yourself if you haven't!
沒幹過架，怎會瞭解自己？
I don't wanna die without any scars.
我希望死的時候身上滿是傷痕
- Come on. Hit me, before I lose my nerve.
- Oh, God. This is crazy.
在我還有勇氣的時候打我
神經病
So go crazy! Let it rip.
發神經啊，快打我
我覺得不好吧
- I don't know about this.
- I don't either.
管他呢，又沒有人看
Who gives a shit? No-one's watching.
What do you care?
你真的要我打你？
This is crazy. You want me to hit you?!
沒錯
That's right.
打臉嗎？
- Where? Like, in the face?
- Surprise me.
隨便你
這主意真他媽蠢....
This is so fucking stupid.
去你的
Motherfucker!
He hit me in the ear!
你居然打我耳朵
對不起
- Well, Jesus, I'm sorry.
- Ow, Christ!
為什麼打我耳朵？操
- Why the ear, man?
- I fucked it up.
No, that was perfect.
是我的錯
不，這樣很棒
No, it's all right.
你沒事吧？
It really hurts.
很痛啊
沒錯
Right.
再打我一次
Hit me again.
No, you hit me. Come on!
換你打我了
打我啊
我們應該再打一場
We should do this again sometime.
你的車呢？
- Where's your car?
- What car?
什麼車？
I don't know how Tyler found that house
不知道泰勒怎麼找到那地方
他說他住在那裏一年了
but he said he'd been there for a year.
看起來好像快拆除的房子
It looked like it was waiting to be torn down.
窗戶都被封死了
Most of the windows were boarded up.
There was no lock on the front door from
when the police, or whoever, kicked it in.
門也無法上鎖
樓梯隨時都會垮
The stairs were ready to collapse.
這裏是他的，還是偷住的？
I didn't know if he owned it or was squatting.
Neither would have surprised me.
我覺得都有可能
那是你的，那是我的
Yep. That's you.
That's me. That's the toilet. Good?
那是廁所，可以吧？
很好，謝謝
Yeah, thanks.
What a shithole.
什麼爛地方
Nothing worked.
什麼都不能用
Turning on one light meant
another light in the house went out.
開這盞燈，另一盞燈就會滅
方圓百里只有倉庫和造紙廠
There were no neighbors.
Just warehouses and a paper mill.
有蒸氣的惡臭
That fart smell of steam.
The hamster-cage smell of wood chips.
還有木頭的腐朽味道
What have we here?
等一下
你們好
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.
Every time it rained, we had to kill the power.
碰到下雨，我們還得切掉電源
都月底了，我也不想看電視
By the end of the first month,
I didn't miss TV.
更不在乎熱騰騰的冰箱
I didn't even mind the warm, stale refrigerator.
Can I be next?
我下一個好嗎？
好啊
All right, man.
鬆開領帶
Lose the tie.
晚上我和泰勒住在偏僻的房裏
At night, Tyler and I were alone
for half a mile in every direction.
Rain trickled down through
the plaster and the light fixtures.
屋頂不斷漏下雨滴
只要是木製的傢俱通通膨脹
Everything wooden swelled and shrank.
生銹的釘子都跑了出來
Everywhere were rusted nails
to snag your elbow on.
The previous occupant had been a shut-in.
之前的住家一定都不出門
Hey, man. What are you reading?
你在讀什麼？
以某個器官做第一人稱的文章
Listen to this. It's an article written
by an organ in the first person.
「我是傑克的脊髓」
"I am Jack's medulla oblongata.
Without me,
「沒有了我，他就沒有心跳」
Jack could not regulate
his heart rate or breathing."
「沒有血壓，不能呼吸」
There's a whole series of these.
還有很多「我是吉兒的乳頭」
"I Am Jill's Nipples."
「我是傑克的結腸」
- "I Am Jack's Colon."
- "I Get Cancer. I Kill Jack."
呵呵，「我得了癌癥，會害死傑克」
每次打架後，我的聽力就減弱
After fighting, everything else
in life got the volume turned down.
What?
什麼？
- You could deal with anything.
- Have you finished those reports?
什麼事情都迎刃而解
報告寫完了嗎？
If you could choose,
who would you fight?
你最想跟誰打架？
I'd fight my boss, probably.
我老闆吧
Really?
真的？
- Yeah, why? Who would you fight?
- I'd fight my dad.
你呢？
我爸
I don't know my dad.
我不認識我爸
I mean, I know him, but...
我認識他啦
可是我六歲時，他就離開了
He left when I was like, six years old.
娶了另一個女人，生其他孩子
Married this other woman
and had some other kids.
他每六年就換地方，重新成家
He did this every six years.
- He changes city and starts a new family.
- Fucker's setting up franchises!
他是在開分公司嗎？
My dad never went to college.
我爸沒讀大學，所以我必須讀
- So it was real important that I go.
- That sounds familiar.
這經歷聽起來很熟悉
我畢業後打電話給他
So I graduate. Call him up long-distance
and say, "Dad, now what?"
「爸，我現在要做什麼？」
他說「找工作啊」
- He says, "Get ajob."
- Same here.
我也是
Now I'm 25. Make my yearly call again.
我現在長大了，打電話給他
我問「爸，我現在要幹嘛？」
"Dad, now what?"
他說「不知道，結婚吧」
He says, "I dunno. Get married."
You can't get married.
你不可能結婚的
我是個30歲的小孩子
I'm a 30-year-old boy.
我們都是被女人養大的
We're a generation of men raised by women.
I'm wondering if another woman
is really the answer we need.
再找一個女人就可以了嗎？
大多數時候，我倆互相照顧
Most of the week, we were Ozzie and Harriet.
可是每到週末夜晚
But every Saturday night,
we were finding something out.
我們都要找事做
證明自己不是孤獨的
We were finding out more and more
that we were not alone.
It used to be that when I came home angry
or depressed, I'd just clean my condo.
我以前要是帶著憤怒回家
我會打掃公寓，替傢俱打蠟
Polish my Scandinavian furniture.
我早該另覓公寓
I should have been looking for a new condo
or haggling with my insurance company.
找保險公司辦理賠的
我應該要替我的失去感到難過
I should have been upset
about my nice flaming little shit.
可是我沒有
But I wasn't.
各公司的網絡著重在於效率
The premise of cybernetting an office
is make things more efficient.
我只是期待下星期的來臨
Monday mornings,
I just thought about next week.
用藍色矢車菊做代表圖好嗎？
Can I get the icon in cornflower blue?
好啊
Absolutely.
最重要的是效率
Efficiency is priority No.1, people.
因為浪費就是盜竊行為
Because waste is a thief.
我給朋友看過了，你喜歡吧？
I showed this to my man here.
You liked it, didn't you?
You can swallow a pint of blood
before you get sick.
只要喝一品脫的血就會生病
It was right in everyone's face.
每個人臉上都有這種表情
泰勒和我只是表現出來
Tyler and I just made it visible.
大家都這麼想
It was on the tip of everyone's tongue.
泰勒和我則直言不諱
Tyler and I just gave it a name.
Come on, you've gotta go home!
各位，你們必須回家了
關掉音樂，把後門鎖上
Turn off the jukebox. Lock the back.
Every week,
Tyler gave the rules that he and I decided.
泰勒每周都重述我倆訂的規則
Gentlemen!
各位
歡迎來到搏擊俱樂部
Welcome to Fight Club.
搏擊俱樂部第一條規則
The first rule of Fight Club is
就是不能提及搏擊俱樂部
you do not talk about Fight Club.
搏擊俱樂部第二條規則
The second rule of Fight Club is
還是不能提及搏擊俱樂部
you do not talk about Fight Club!
Third rule of Fight Club.
第三條規則
只要有人喊停，四肢受傷
Someone yells stop, goes limp, taps out,
快累死了，打鬥就得停
the fight is over. Fourth rule.
第四條規則，一次只能兩個人打
Only two guys to a fight.
Fifth rule.

就一定得打
you have to fight.
辦公室的小弟李奇
This kid from work, Ricky,
上班時什麼事都記不住
couldn't remember whether
you ordered pens with blue ink or black.
But Ricky was a god for ten minutes
但他打架的招式可是一流的
when he trounced
the maitre d' of a local food court.
Sometimes, all you could hear were the flat,
hard, packing sounds over the yelling.
在吶喊聲中，只聽得見打擊聲
或是滿嘴是血的咳嗽聲
Or the wet choke
when someone gasped and sprayed...
停
Stop!
在那裏，你才真正的活了起來
You weren't alive anywhere
like you were there.
搏擊俱樂部只在聚會時存在
But Fight Club only exists in the hours
between when Fight Club starts and ends.
就算是我認為打得很棒的人
Even if I could tell someone
they had a good fight,
聚會結束後，也會馬上改變
I wouldn't be talking to the same man.
在俱樂部的你不是其他地方的你
Who you were in Fight Club
is not who you were outside of it.
A guy came to Fight Club for the first time.
His ass was a wad of cookie dough.
剛來俱樂部的人
屁股都是光滑圓潤
幾周後，就像雕刻過的木頭
After a few weeks, he was carved out of wood.
你最想跟哪個名人打？
If you could fight any celebrity,
who would you fight?
活的還是死的？
- Alive or dead?
- Doesn't matter. Who'd be tough?
都可以，誰最難屈服？
海明威
Hemingway. You?
你呢？
沙特納
Shatner. I'd fight William Shatner.
我要跟威廉沙特納打
We all started seeing things differently.
我們開始有不同觀點
不管到哪，我們都會評論
Everywhere we went,
we were sizing things up.
I felt sorry for guys packed into gyms,
我覺得上健身房的人真可悲
trying to look like how Calvin Klein
or Tommy Hilfiger said they should.
以凱文克萊的標準為目標
那是男人應該有的樣子嗎？
Is that what a man looks like?
自我成長要靠手淫
Oh, self-improvement is masturbation.
自我毀滅…
Now, self-destruction...
Excuse me.
搏擊俱樂部不在乎輸贏
Fight Club wasn't about winning or losing.
也不需要言語
It wasn't about words.
真正的吶喊聲含在嘴裏
The hysterical shouting was in tongues
跟聖靈降臨教派類似
like at a Pentecostal Church.
停…
- Is that it?
- Stop!
打架結束後，不需要處理問題
When the fight was over, nothing was solved.
But nothing mattered.
因為一切都沒關係
真棒
Cool.
Afterwards, we all felt saved.
打過之後，猶如被救贖一般
Hey, man. How about next week?
下禮拜怎樣？
How about next month?!
下個月呢？
Irvine, you're in the middle.
說話小心點
艾文到中間來，新來的也過來
New guy, you too.
Sometimes, Tyler spoke for me.
有時候泰勒會替我說話
他從樓梯上摔了下來
He fell down some stairs.
我從樓梯上摔了下來
I fell down some stairs.
Fight Club became the reason to cut
your hair short or trim your fingernails.
因為俱樂部，我剪髮剪指甲
歷史上的人物呢？
OK. Any historical figure.
I'd fight Gandhi.
我會跟甘地打
Good answer.
妙答案
- How about you?
- Lincoln.
你呢？
林肯
Lincoln?
林肯？
他很高大，會打到快死才肯停
Big guy, big reach.
Skinny guys fight till they're burger.
操
Fuck!
年紀大了，不中用了
Hey, even the Mona Lisa's falling apart.
喂？
Hello?
你這兩個月到哪去了？
Where have you been the last eight weeks?
Marla?
瑪拉？
你怎麼找到我的？
- How did you find me?
- You left a forwarding number.
你在答錄機上留的
我都沒在團體課上看見你
I haven't seen you at any support groups.
We split 'em up.
That was the idea. Remember?
因為我們分開上了啊
可是你也沒去上你的課啊
Yeah, but you haven't been going to yours.
你怎麼知道？
- How do you know?
- I cheated.
我作弊了
I found a new one.
我找到新的寄托
真的？
- Really?
- It's for men only.
只有男人可以參加
跟睪丸癌一樣嗎？
Like the testicle thing?
Look, this is a bad time.
我現在不能跟你談
I've been going to Debtors Anonymous.
我參加了花錢狂治療團體
那裏到處都是毫無希望的人
- They're really fucked-up people...
- I'm on my way out.
我剛好要出門
我也是
我吃了好多安眠藥
Me too. I've got a stomach full of Xanax.
把瓶子裏的通通吃光了
I took what was left of a bottle.
可能吃太多了吧
It might have been too much.
我想像著瑪拉在家裏蹣跚的樣子
Picture Marla Singer throw herself
around her crummy apartment.
我並不想自殺，只是想求助
This isn't a for-real suicide thing.
This is probably a cry-for-help thing.
她可能要搞好幾個小時
So you're staying in tonight, then?
你今晚會在家囉？
要不要聽我描述死亡？
Do you wanna wait
and hear me describe death?
Do you wanna listen
and see if my spirit can use a phone?
等著看我有多少精神講電話
聽過死前的喘息嗎？
Have you ever heard a death rattle before?
聽過死前的喘息嗎？
泰勒的門關著
Tyler's door was closed. I'd been here for
two months and his door was never closed.
這兩個月來，他的門從沒關過
You won't believe this dream
I had last night.
我做了一個很誇張的夢
我也不敢相信昨晚的事
I can hardly believe anything about last night.
你怎麼會在這裏？
What are you doing here?
What?
什麼？
這是我家，你怎麼會在我家？
This is my house.
What are you doing here?
去你的
Fuck you!
Oh, you've got some fucked-up friends!
你朋友真的被搞死了
Limber, though.
可是她很有彈性
Silly cooze.
愚蠢的性玩具
I come in last night. Phone's off the hook.
我看到電話沒掛
想聽聽看是誰？
Guess who's on the other end?
不用他說，我就知道經過了
I knew the story before he told me.
Have you ever heard a death rattle before?
聽過死前的喘息嗎？
Do you think it'll live up to its name?
你覺得這名字響亮嗎？
Or will it just be a death hairball?
說不定我只會發出乾咳聲
或者是將靈魂帶到…
Prepare to evacuate soul.
10…
Ten,
9…
nine,... eight...
8…
泰勒為什麼不希望瑪拉死？
How could Tyler, of all people,
think it was a bad thing
that Marla Singer was about to die?
5…
Five,
four...
4…
3…等一下
Hang on.
你跑來得真快
You got here fast.
Did I call you?
我有打電話給你嗎？
The mattress is all sealed in slippery plastic.
床罩太滑了
別擔心，那東西不會傷害你
Oh, don't worry. It's not a threat to you.
糟糕，有人報警了
Oh, fuck!
Somebody called the cops.
- Hey, where's 513?
- End of the hall.
513房在哪裏？
最後一間
The girl who lives there
used to be a charming, lovely girl.
裏面那個女孩本來很好的
可是她失去了自信
She has lost faith in herself.
辛格小姐，我們是來幫你的
- Miss Singer, let us help you!
- She's a monster!
她是個禽獸
- You have every reason to live.
- She's infectious human waste!
你不可以死
她是個骯髒的人渣
- Miss Singer!
- Good luck trying to save her!
祝你們救得到她
If I fall asleep,
要是我睡著就死定了
I'm done for.
所以你必須保持我清醒
You're gonna have to keep me up
一整晚喔
all night.
Un-fucking-believable.
太不可思議了
他很輕易地解決了瑪拉的問題
He was obviously able to handle it.
你也知道的，因為你跟她幹過
- You know what I mean, you fucked her.
- No, I didn't.
我沒有
- Never?
- No.
沒有？
對
You're not into her, are you?
你不喜歡她嗎？
才沒有呢
No! God, not at all.
我真是氣瘋了
I am Jack's raging bile duct.
真的？告訴我沒關係
Are you sure? You can tell me.
真的
Believe me, I'm sure.
乾脆讓我自殺算了
- Put a gun to my head and spray my brains.
- That's good.
那好，因為她其實兇悍的很
離她遠一點
She's a predator posing as a house pet.
Stay away.
The shit that came out of
this woman's mouth, I had never heard!
那女的說話很粗
My God.
我很久沒干的這麼爽了
I haven't been fucked like that
since grade school.
泰勒當然會喜歡那種人
How could Tyler not go for that?
The other night,
he was splicing sex organs into Cinderella.
他曾把色情片剪入灰姑娘裏呢
Marla doesn't need a lover,
just a caseworker.
瑪拉只是需要一個撫慰的人
我們只是互相發洩
Or a wash.
This isn't love, it's sport fucking.
She invaded my support groups
and now my home.
她先是闖入我的安慰團體
現在又闖入我家
Hey, hey. Sit down.
坐下
Now, listen.
I can't have you talking to her about me.
你不能跟她談我的事
Why would I...
我幹嘛…
你敢跟她說我或這間房子的事
Say anything about me or what goes on
in this house to her or anybody,... we're done.
我們就絕交
發誓
- Now promise me. You promise?
- OK.
好啦
發誓啊
我發誓
- Yeah, I promise.
- Promise?
發誓啊
我已經發誓了啊
- I just said, I promise! What...
- That's three times you promised.
你要發誓三次
If only I had wasted a few minutes
and gone to watch Marla Singer die,
若我當時花幾分鐘等瑪拉死
就不會這樣子了
none of this would have happened.
Harder, yes! Oh, harder, harder!
I could have moved to another room.
其實我可以搬到…
三樓，就聽不到他們的聲音
On the third floor
where I might not have heard them.
But I didn't.
可是我沒搬
你在幹嘛？
- What are you doing?
- Just going to bed.
準備上床睡覺啊
Wanna finish her off?
你要接替我嗎？
不用，謝謝
- No. No, thank you.
- I've found a cigarette.
我找到香煙了
- Who were you talking to?
- Shut up.
你跟誰說話？
閉嘴
I became the calm little center of the world.
我成了世界最靜的一角
I was the Zen master.
我是忍者大師
我開始寫短徘句詩
I wrote little haiku poems.
將詩用電子郵件傳給他人
I e-mailed them to everyone.
Is that your blood?
那是你的血？
Some of it, yeah.
有些是
You can't smoke in here.
這裏不能抽煙
Take the rest of the day off.
休一天假，回家換件乾淨衣服
Come back Monday with some clean clothes.
Get yourself together.
重新振作一下
每個人的臉上都帶著敵意
I got right in everyone's hostile face.
"Yes, these are bruises from fighting."
對，這些是打架後的瘀青
"Yes, I'm comfortable with that."
沒錯，我很喜歡這個樣子
我受到了啟發
"I am enlightened."
You give up the condo life, give up
all your flaming worldly possessions,
放棄公寓生活和物質生活
住在一個偏僻的爛房子裏
move to a dilapidated house
in a toxic waste area,
回家還要面對這個
and you have to come home to this.
- Hello.
- This is Detective Stern with the Arson Unit.
我是縱火組的史丹警探
We have some new information about
the incident at your former condo.
你公寓的事，我們有了新線索
你知道有人在你門鎖上灑冷媒
Yes.
I don't know if you're aware, but someone
sprayed Freon into your front-door lock.
然後用鑿子打鎖引起火花的？
They used a chisel to shatter the cylinder.
No, I wasn't aware of that.
我不知道
I am Jack's cold sweat.
我馬上打冷顫
Does this sound strange to you?
你覺得奇怪嗎？
是，非常奇怪
Yes, sir, strange. Very strange.
炸藥…
炸藥
- The dynamite
- Dynamite?
現場有殘留的銨酸鉀氯化鹽
left a residue
of ammonium oxalate potassium perchloride.
- Do you know what this means?
- No, what does it mean?
知道那是什麼意思嗎？
不知道
表示那是自製的
It means it was home-made.
I'm sorry. This is just coming
as quite a shock to me, sir.
抱歉，我也覺得很驚訝
Whoever set this dynamite could have blown
out your pilot light days before the explosion.
就是這樣，瓦斯火苗才熄的
瓦斯是真正爆炸的原因
- The gas was just a detonator.
- Who would go and do that?
是誰做的？
- I'll ask the questions.
- Tell him.
我才要問你這個呢
告訴他啊
Tell him the liberator who destroyed
my property realigned my perceptions.
說是那些自由派份子搞得鬼
Excuse me. Are you there?
你在聽嗎？
有啊，我只是不知道該怎麼想
I am listening.
It's hard to know what to make of this.
Have you recently made enemies who might
have access to home-made dynamite?
你有什麼敵人嗎？
- Enemies?
- Reject civilization,
敵人？
我要忘了物質生活的重要
especially material possessions.
- Son, this is serious.
- Yes, I know it's serious.
這件事很重要
我知道
我說真的
- I mean that.
- Yes, it's very serious.
我知道這件事很重要
Look, nobody takes this
more seriously than me.
這件事對我比任何人都重要
That condo was my life. OK?
那間公寓等於我的生命
裏面每樣傢俱都是我的最愛
I loved every stick of furniture in that place.
That was not just a bunch of stuff
that got destroyed.
被毀的不只是冷冰冰的東西
- It was me!
- I'd like to thank the Academy.
被毀的是我
我真要好好感謝大學教育
- Is this not a good time for you?
- Just tell him you fucking did it!
你現在不方便討論這件事嗎？
告訴他是你做的嘛
Tell him you blew it all up!
That's what he wants to hear.
他希望你說是你弄的
- Are you still there?
- Wait. Are you saying that I'm a suspect?
你還在聽嗎？
你認為我是嫌犯？
不是，我們只是需要再談談
No. I may need to talk to you, so you
let me know if you're gonna leave town.
若你要出遠門，記得告訴我
- OK?
- OK.
可以嗎？
好
Except for their humping,
Tyler and Marla were never in the same room.
泰勒和瑪拉從不同時出現
My parents pulled this exact same act
for years.
我爸媽也曾這樣好多年
The condom is the glass slipper
of our generation.
保險套是我們這代的玻璃鞋
遇到陌生人時就得戴上一個
You slip one on when you meet a stranger.
You... dance all night.
跳整晚舞之後，就把這東西丟掉
Then you throw it away.
The condom, I mean. Not the stranger.
丟保險套，不是陌生人
What?
什麼？
I got this dress at a thrift store for $1.
我花一塊錢買下了這件禮服
It was worth every penny.
一分錢一分貨
It's a bridesmaid's dress.
這件是結婚禮服
Someone loved it intensely
這件衣服只會被珍惜一天
for one day.
Then tossed it.
然後就被扔了
Like a Christmas tree.
就好像聖誕樹
So special.
本來很特別的
Then
可是…
bam!
轟一聲
It's on the side of the road.
就被丟棄路旁
Tinsel still clinging to it.
連裝飾品都還沒拆呢
Like a sex crime victim.
就像被姦殺後的死人一樣
Underwear inside out.
內褲穿反了
- Bound with electrical tape.
- Well then, it suits you.
還被黑黑的膠帶纏起來
這件衣服的確很適合你
You can borrow it sometime.
你喜歡我可以借你
Get rid of her.
趕她走
- What? You get rid of her!
- Don't mention me.
什麼？你來趕她啊
別提到我
I am six years old again,
passing messages between parents.
我又回到了六歲，替父母傳話
- I really think it's time you left.
- Don't worry, I'm leaving.
你該走了吧
我正要走
- Not that we don't love your visits.
- You are such a nutcase. I can't keep up.
我們不喜歡你來
神經病，我真的受不了你了
Gotta get off
我得走囉…
Thanks. Bye.
謝謝，再見
Gotta get off of this merry-go-round
Gonna get, need to get...
不可以再繼續留戀下去
Gotta get...
你們喔…
You kids!
為什麼要浪費時間在她身上？
Why do you still waste time with her?
I'll say this about Marla.
因為瑪拉至少想壞得徹底
At least she's trying to hit bottom.
And I'm not?
我沒有嗎？
Feathers up your butt
do not make you a chicken.
插上羽毛，不等於你就是老鷹
What are we doing tonight?
今晚要幹嘛？
今晚…
Tonight... we make soap.
要做肥皂
Really?
真的？
To make soap, first we render fat.
要先提煉脂肪才能做肥皂
要先提煉脂肪才能做肥皂
The salt balance has to be just right
鹽份的量要很正確
so the best fat for soap comes from humans.
所以最好的脂肪是人體脂肪
- Wait, what is this place?
- A liposuction clinic.
這是哪裏？
抽脂診所
Pay dirt!
找到了
Richest, creamiest fat in the world.
Fat of the land!
全世界最有養分，最油的脂肪
無與倫比的
No! Don't pull it, don't pull it!
不要拉，不要拉
- Oh, God!
- Give me another one.
再給我一包
As the fat renders,
the tallows float to the surface.
提煉脂肪時，動物脂肪就會浮出來
Like in Boy Scouts.
跟童子軍時學的一樣
- It's hard to imagine you as a Boy Scout.
- Keep stirring.
我能想像出你童子軍時的模樣
繼續攪拌
Once the tallow hardens,
you skim off a layer of glycerin.
獸脂變硬後，除去表面的甘油
加上硝酸後，就變成硝化甘油
Add nitric acid, you've got nitroglycerin.
Then add sodium nitrate and sawdust,
you've got dynamite.
在加硝酸鈉和鋸屑
就可以做成炸藥
Yeah, with enough soap,
one could blow up just about anything.
做肥皂，就能做很多炸藥
Tyler was full of useful information.
泰勒很有小聰明
People found clothes got cleaner
when washed at a certain point in the river.
古人知道小溪哪段最能洗衣服
- You know why?
- No.
為什麼？
不知道
不知道
只要找供奉生人的那段就對了
Human sacrifices were once made
on the hills above this river.
Bodies burnt.
Water permeated the ashes to create lye.
因為屍體燃燒時
水沖刷灰燼會產生堿液
This is lye. The crucial ingredient.
這就是堿液
混合了屍體被燒熔的脂肪
Once it mixed with the melted body fat,
a white soapy discharge crept into the river.
就能排出肥皂成份進入小溪
May I see your hand, please?
給我看看你的手好嗎？
What is this?
你在幹嘛？
This is a chemical burn.
這叫做化學灼傷
It will hurt more than any burn
and it will leave a scar.
比其他灼傷都要痛
而且會留下疤痕
你要幹嘛？
Meditation worked for cancer,
it could work now.
這東西比癌癥還要痛
- Don't shut the pain out.
- Oh, God!
感受一下這種疼痛
最早的肥皂都是英雄的灰燼
The first soap was made from heroes' ashes,
like the first monkey shot into space.
跟首只上太空的猴子一樣偉大
Without pain or sacrifice,
we would have nothing.
沒有痛苦和犧牲，就沒有收穫
I tried not to think
of the word searing of flesh.
我試著不去想「灼傷」這個詞
Stop it!
This is your pain, this is your burning hand.
停下，這就是你的痛
我要到洞裏找我的精神動物
I'm going to my cave
to find my power animal.
No! Don't deal with this
the way those dead people do! Come on!
不要用快死的人的方式躲避疼痛
- I get the point!
- No! You're feeling premature enlightenment.
我懂你要傳達的事了
那還不夠成熟
It's the greatest moment of your life,
and you're off somewhere else!
不要錯過一生最棒的時刻
I am not!
Shut up!
Our fathers were our models for God.
閉嘴
我們的父親就像上帝的分身
If our fathers bailed,
what does that tell you about God?
連父親都拋棄我們
更何況上帝
不會這樣吧
Listen to me. You have to consider
the possibility that God does not like you.
聽我說
你要假設上帝不愛你
He never wanted you.
In all probability, He hates you.
他一直都不想要你
或許還很討厭你呢
This is not the worst thing that can happen.
We don't need Him!
你的痛不是最悲慘的事
不是嗎？
我們不需要他
- I agree!
- Fuck damnation, fuck redemption.
不需要
去他的詛咒和贖罪
We are God's unwanted children? So be it!
我們都是被上帝遺棄的子民
- I'm getting water!
- You can use water and make it worse or...
我要拿水
用水澆會更糟糕的
看著我
- Or use vinegar to neutralize the burn.
- Please let me up!
用醋來中和吧
放開我
First, you have to give up.
你得先放棄一切
First, you have to know, not fear,
你必須沒有恐懼
know that some day, you're gonna die.
面對你總有天會死的事實
You don't know how this feels!
你不知道這有多痛
It's only after we've lost everything
that we're free to do anything.
只有拋棄一切，才能獲得自由
OK.
好
Congratulations.
恭喜你
You're one step closer to hitting the bottom.
你越來越接近極限了
泰勒將肥皂以每條20元
Tyler sold his soap
to department stores at $20 a bar.
賣給百貨公司
God knows what they charged.
不知道他們賣多少錢
- This is the best soap.
- Why, thank you, Susan.
大家都說這種肥皂最好用
謝謝你，蘇珊
It was beautiful.
漂亮
We were selling rich women
their own fat asses back to them.

with an Armalite AR10 carbine gas-powered
semiautomatic weapon,

pumping round after round
into colleagues and co-workers.

you've known for years.

Someone very, very close to you.
Tyler's words coming out of my mouth.
那些都是泰勒會說的話
And I used to be such a nice guy.
以前的我是個好好先生

every piece of trash you pick up.
不要每次撿到東西就找我

你說什麼？
替我檢查是否長乳癌了好嗎？
- Go to a hospital.
- I can't afford to waste money on a doctor.
去醫院啊
我沒錢去
我又不懂這個

- No, this is Detective Stern of the Arson Unit.
泰勒？
不是，我是縱火組的史頓警探
我要請你明天早上到局裏談談
I need to see you...
I went to all the cities
on Tyler's used ticket stubs, barhopping.
我去泰勒到過的每個地方
我不知道怎麼回事
I didn't know how or why, but I could look
at 50 different bars, and somehow I just knew.
但只要看到某個酒吧
我就知道那裏有問題
I'm looking for Tyler Durden.
It's very important that I talk to him.
我要找泰勒德頓
我一定要跟他談談
I wish I could help you,
我也希望我能幫到你
sir.
長官
Every city I went to,
不管我到什麼地方
as soon as I set foot off the plane
只要我一下飛機
I knew a Fight Club was close.
就能感覺附近有搏擊俱樂部
Hey! Hey!
Taxi!
你看我的臉，我也是會員
Look at my face. I'm a member.
我只想知道你看到泰勒了嗎？
Now, I just need to know if you've seen Tyler.
I'm not exposed to bespeak
any such information to you
我不能將這種訊息告訴你
nor would I, even if I had
said information at this juncture,... be able.
也不能將有關的情報告訴你
- You're a moron.

你是白癡
我得要求你離開
Tyler had been busy...
setting up franchises all over the country.

忙著在全國設立分會
Was I asleep? Had I slept?
我在睡覺嗎？
我睡過嗎？
Is Tyler my bad dream, or am I Tyler's?
泰勒是我的夢魘或我是他的？
- We've just heard the stories.
- What kind of stories?
我只知道一個傳說
什麼傳說
沒有人知道他長什麼樣子
- Nobody knows what he looks like.
- He has plastic surgery every three years.
他每三年就動一次變臉手術
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.
那是我聽過的最蠢的事
邁阿密真的有搏擊俱樂部？
- Is it true about Fight Club in Miami?
- Is Mr Durden building an army?
泰勒是不是在組織軍隊？
I was living in a state of perpetual déjà vu.
我一直活在似曾相似的情境中
Everywhere I went,
每到一個地方
我都覺得自己好像也去過
I felt I'd already been there.
It was like following an invisible man.
就像跟蹤一個隱者一樣
The smell of dried blood,
有干血的味道
到處都是骯髒的腳印
dirty, bare footprints circling each other.
還有烤雞一般的味道
That aroma of old sweat, like fried chicken.
The feel of a floor still warm
from a fight the night before.
我還能感受前一晚的打鬥感覺
I was always just one step behind Tyler.
我每次都比泰勒晚一步
His name is Robert Paulsen...
他的名字是鮑伯寶森…
Welcome back, sir.
歡迎你回來，長官
How have you been?

Thursday?
星期四？

Please return your seat backs
to their full upright and locked position.
請繫上安全帶，將座椅推到鎖定的位置

喂？
瑪拉，是我
- Have we ever done it?
- Done what?
我們做過嗎？
做什麼？
Had sex?
我們做過愛嗎？
What kind of stupid question is that?
那是什麼蠢問題？
Stupid because it's yes
or because it's no?
為什麼蠢？
就因為問我們做過還是沒做過？
- Is this a trick?
- No. I need to know...
你在惡作劇嗎？
不是，我必須知道…
You wanna know if I think
we were just having sex or making love?
你不知道我們有沒有做過愛？
- We did make love?
- Is that what you're calling it?
我們做過了？
你就打電話來問這個？
Just answer the question!
Did we do it or not?!

You fuck me, then snub me.
You love me, you hate me.
你干了我，又甩掉我
你愛過我，又討厭我
You're sensitive,
then you turn into an asshole.
你一會兒感情豐富
一會兒又變成冷酷的混蛋
Does that describe our relationship, Tyler?
這樣描述我倆的關係夠了吧？
泰勒
We just lost cabin pressure.
我的血液溫度降到了冰點
What did you just say?
你說什麼？
- What is wrong with you?
- Say my name!
你怎麼回事？
你剛才叫我什麼？
說一次我的名字
Tyler Durden!
You fucking freak! What's going on?
泰勒德頓，泰勒德頓啊，神經病
怎麼回事？我馬上過去
- I'm coming over!
- I'm not there!
等一下，瑪拉，我不在那裏
You broke your promise.
你沒有遵守你的誓言
Jesus, Tyler.
天啊，泰勒
- You fucking talked to her about me.
- What the fuck is going on?
你怎麼可以跟她說我的事
怎麼回事？
我只要求你做這一件事
I asked you for one thing. One simple thing.
一件非常簡單的事情
為什麼其他人都以為我是你？
Why do people think that I'm you?
回答我啊
Answer me!
Sit.
坐下
Answer me. Why do people think I'm you?

possibly confuse you with me?

說啊
Because...
因為…
Say it!
說啊
Because we're the same person.
因為我們是同一個人
That's right.
沒錯
We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap.
我們都只是來這世界走一遭
- I don't understand this.
- You wanted a way to change your life.
我不懂
你想改變你的生活
You could not do this on your own.
但是你一個人辦不到
All the ways you wish you could be,
你一直想要變成…
that's me.
我這個的樣子
I look like you wanna look,
I fuck like you wanna fuck.
我長得像你希望的樣子
做愛像你希望的樣子
我很聰明，有能力
最重要的是
I am smart, capable and, most importantly,
我很自由，而你卻相反
I'm free in all the ways that you are not.
Oh, no.
不…
- Tyler's not here. Tyler went away.
- What?
泰勒不在，他離開了，他走了
什麼？
This isn't possible. This is crazy.
不會吧
這太瘋狂了
People do it every day.
每天都有很多人這樣
They talk to themselves.
They see themselves as they'd like to be.
他們自言自語，看著自己
但他們沒有你的勇氣
They don't have the courage you have
to just run with it.
不敢去做
You still wrestle with it,
so sometimes you're still you.
為什麼不能這樣呢？
你有時候還是你自己
- We should do this again sometime.
- At times, you imagine you're watching me.
我們有機會應該常常這樣
有時候你以為你在看著我
若今晚是你一次參加俱樂部
If this is your first time, you have to fight.
就必須打
Little by little,
you're just letting yourself become
漸漸地…你讓自己變成了…
泰勒德頓
Tyler Durden.
工作不代表你
財產也不代表你
You are not yourjob
or how much money you have!
- No. You have a house.
- Rented in your name.
你有房子
是你租的！
- You have jobs, a life.
- You work nights because you can't sleep.
你有工作，你有生活
你晚上兼差
因為你睡不著所以你作肥皂
Or you stay up and make soap.
你為什麼要跟瑪拉上床？
- You're fucking Marla, Tyler.
- Technically, you are. It's all the same to her.
技術上來說
跟她上床的人是你
對她來說都是你
Oh, my God.
天哪
Now you see our dilemma.
你發現難題了吧？
She knows too much.
她知道的太多了
I think we're gonna have to talk about
how this might compromise our goals.
我們得考慮一個解決的方法
What... What are you saying?
你說什麼？
This is bullshit. This is bullshit,
I'm not listening to this!
簡直是胡扯…
我不聽，你發瘋了
- You are insane!
- No. You're insane.
沒有，瘋的是你
We simply do not have time for this crap.
我們沒有時間說這些了
It's called a changeover.
這裏就是所謂的劇情急轉直下
The movie goes on
電影繼續下去
and nobody in the audience has any idea.
但是觀眾還是一頭霧水
- Sir! Are you checking out?
- Yeah. Bill me.
先生，你要退房了嗎？
是的
Can you initial this list of phone calls?
請先付這兩通電話費
- When were these made?
- Between 2.00 and 3.30 this morning.
這通是什麼時候打的？
是凌晨2點到3點半間打的
Have I been going to bed earlier every night?
Have I been sleeping later?
我是否每天都提早睡覺？
我後來有睡覺嗎？
Have I been Tyler longer and longer?
我變成泰勒的時間越來越長了？
Is anybody here?
有人在嗎？
Déjà vu all over again.
似曾相識，又開始了
With enough soap,
one could blow up anything.
有足夠的肥皂，就可炸毀一切
Oh, my God.

Your bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom!
They almost broke my arm!
你們這些光頭佬，總是找我麻煩

on your part, but hear me out.

不要發問
管他的

and baked potato and a chocolate chiffon pie.
我要烤雞，湯，什麼都要
要乾淨的食物

In that case,
may I advise against the clam chowder.
我建議不要是蛤蜊湯
就不要蛤蜊湯
No clam chowder. Thank you.
You got about 30 seconds.

我知道我的行為很怪
I know I've been acting very strange, OK?
感覺好像是兩面人

- Two sides?
兩面？你根本是百面人
- You're Dr Jekyll and Mr Jackass.
- I know. But I realized something important.
你要罵我什麼都可以
我終於搞清楚了一件事
- What?
- The nature of our relationship wasn't clear
什麼事？
我到現在才瞭解我倆的關係
重要的是，我對你一直很不好
to me for reasons I won't go into.
- I know I haven't treated you well.
- Whatever.
是啊…
不…15秒，15秒

你不安全
閉嘴…

I can't explain it now, just trust me!
因為你的生命有危險

準備引爆
Chapters have sprung up
in five or six other major cities already.
This is a tightly-regimented organization

Keep your mouth shut.
給我閉嘴，可惡
Shit!
我們得到一些已經證實的消息
Some of this information checks out.
準備到那裏去看看吧

好的
Hey, wait!
我抓到了

長官，我們必須帶你去

橡皮筋呢？
Get away from me! Drop that fucking knife!
不要碰我，把刀放下，放下
Back up. Face down on the floor right now!
退後
馬上給我趴下
Get down on the floor!
快趴下
The first person
that comes out of this door
誰先出來，就先吃子彈
gets a lead salad! Understand?
Get away! Stay away!
走開
I ran.
我一直跑
I ran until my muscles burned
and my veins pumped battery acid.

你現在要幹嘛？
- I'm stopping this.
- Why?

in 10 other buildings.
其他10棟大樓裏還有炸彈呢
Since when is Project Mayhem
about murder?
去你的
我們從什麼時候開始殺人了？
The buildings are empty.
那些大樓都是空的
大樓裏的警衛都是我們的人
We're not killing anyone.
We're setting 'em free!

我們是在釋放那些人
Bob is dead. They shot him in the head.
鮑伯死了
他們一槍轟了他的頭
You wanna make an omelette,
you gotta break some eggs.
我要犧牲小我完成大我
我不理你了，你根本不存在
No. I'm not listening to you.
You're not even there.
好…
I wouldn't do that.
Not unless you knew which wires were what.
要是我就不會這麼做
If you know, I know.
如果你知道，我就會知道
Or maybe I knew you'd know, so I spent
all day thinking about the wrong ones.
或許我知道你知道什麼
所以我花了整天的時間…
想著錯誤的那條線
You think?
你覺得怎樣？
Oh, heavens, no. Not the green one.
不是綠色的
Pull any one but the green one.
最好不要割斷綠色那條
可惡
I asked you not to do that!
Fuck!
離那裏遠一點
Tyler, get away from the van.
Tyler, I'm not kidding!
Get away from the van!
離那裏遠一點
Goddamn it!
可惡
OK.
好，你對你的好朋友開槍
You are now firing a gun
at your imaginary friend
near 400 gallons of nitroglycerin!
400加侖的炸藥
Cool it, Tyler!
泰勒…
不…
Come on!

What?!
Three minutes.
還有三分鐘，精彩時刻就要到了

Think of everything we've accomplished.
想想我們過去的成就吧
Out these windows, we will view
the collapse of financial history.
我們將從這面窗戶外
看到經濟事件的歷史鏡頭
One step closer to economic equilibrium.
離經濟自由時刻又近了一步
Why is she here?
她怎麼會在這裏？
Tying up loose ends.
她逃不掉的
Put me down, you baldheaded fuck!
放我下來
- I beg you, please don't do this.
- I'm not doing this.
我求求你，不要這樣做
不是我做的
- We are doing this. This is what we want.
- No.
是我們倆一起做的
我們兩個都想這樣
不是

- Right. Except you is meaningless now.
我不想要這樣
沒錯
可是現在你的已經沒有意義了
- We have to forget about you.
- You're a voice in my head.
我們得把你忘了
你是我腦中的聲音而已
You're a voice in mine!
你也只是我腦中的聲音
你只不過是一個幻像
- Why can't I get rid of you?
- You need me.
為什麼我無法幹掉你？
你需要我
不，我真的、再也不需要你了
No. I don't. I really don't any more.
嘿！我是你創造出來的
You created me. I didn't create some
loser alter ego to make me feel better.
我可不會為了讓自己好過點
就創造你這樣的東西出來
- Take some responsibility.

負點責任吧
我有
我願意為這一切負責
我接受這一切
and I accept that.
So, please, I'm begging you,
please call this off.
我求求你了，請你取消這一切吧
Have I ever let us down?
我曾經讓我們失望過嗎？
How far have you come because of me?!
因為我，你成長了不少吧？
I will bring us through this.
我會照顧著你的
As always, I will carry you
kicking and screaming
跟以前一樣
我會保護你
and in the end you will thank me.
即使你又哭又鬧的
最後你還是會感謝我的
Tyler. Tyler.
我很感謝你
I'm grateful to you.
For everything that you've done for me.
謝謝你為我做的一切
But this is too much. I don't want this.
可是這次太誇張了
我不想要這個
What do you want? Your shitjob back?
Fucking condo world, watching sitcoms?
那你要什麼？
回去做原來的爛工作？
爛公寓，看爛電視劇
去他的！
Fuck you! I won't do it.
我才不要這樣干
天啊，這事可不能夠發生
- This can't be happening.
- It's already done, so shut up!
已經都準備好了，閉嘴
60 seconds till CRI.
60秒，乖點
No.
我可以解決的
I can figure this out. This isn't even real.

The gun's in my hand.
槍在我手上
