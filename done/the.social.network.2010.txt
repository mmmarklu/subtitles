知道嗎，中國的天才人數
Did you know there are more people
with genius IQs living in China
比全美國的人加起來還要多
than there are people of any kind
living in the United States?
- 不可能吧
- 真的
- That can't possibly be true.
- It is.
有証明嗎？
What would account for that?
首先，中國人口本來就多的嚇人
我的問題來了
Well, first, an awful lot of people
live in China, but here's my question.
一群學朮水平測驗拿1600分的人
How do you distinguish yourself
in a population of people
你如何在里面脫穎而出
who all got 1600 on their SATs?
- 我怎么不知道中國人也考這個
- 他們不考
- I didn't know they take SATs in China.
- They don't.
現在說的不是中國人，我在說我自己
I wasn't talking about China anymore,
I was talking about me.
你拿了1600分？
You got a 1600?
我可以去阿卡貝拉社團唱歌
可惜我五音不全
Yes. I could sing in an a cappella group,
but I can't sing.
等于說你答對了所有題目？
Does that mean you actually
got nothing wrong?
我可以去賽艇隊或者發明25美元的電腦
I could row crew or invent a $25 PC.
或者你可以進期末俱樂部
Or you could get into a final club.
或者我可以進期末俱樂部
Or I get into a final club.
知道嗎，從女性角度出發
You know, from a woman's perspective,
不去阿卡貝拉社團反而比較好
sometimes not singing in
an a cappella group is a good thing.
我在說正事
This is serious.
再說，我確實喜歡划賽艇的男生
On the other hand,
I do like guys who row crew.
那我做不到
Well, I can't do that.
開玩笑的
I was kidding.
我確實答對了所有題目
And, yes, I got nothing wrong on the test.
- 你申請了沒有？
- 我正在申請
- Have you ever tried?
- I'm trying right now.
- 進賽艇隊？
- 進期末俱樂部
- To row crew?
- To get into a final club.
進賽艇隊？你在做夢嗎？
To row crew? No.
Are you, like, whatever, delusional?
有時一個人同時會產生兩個想法
Maybe it's just sometimes
you say two things at once.
我自己都不知道要說哪一個而已
I'm not sure which one
I'm supposed to be aiming at.
你和賽艇隊的男生約會過是嗎？
But you've seen guys who row crew, right?
沒有
No.
沒錯，他們比我高大，是一流的運動員
Okay, well, they're bigger than me.
They're world-class athletes.
剛才你說你喜歡划賽艇的男生
And a second ago,
you said you like guys who row crew
所以我猜你曾經有過一個
so I assumed you had met one.
我只是喜歡這個想法而已
就好像女孩都喜歡牛仔
I guess I just meant I like the idea of it.
You know, the way a girl likes cowboys.
好吧
Okay.
點吃的嗎？
Should we get something to eat?
談點別的好嗎？
Would you like to talk
about something else?
從你開始說什么期終俱樂部開始
No. It's just since the beginning of
the conversation about finals club,
讓我有種生錯時代的感覺
I think I may have missed a birthday.
中國的天才人數真的比全美國人都…
There are realy more people in China with
genius IQs than the entire population...
鳳凰社活動最多
還有飛行俱樂部…羅斯福是坡客
The Phoenix is the most diverse.
The Fly Club... Roosevelt punched the Porc.
哪一個？
Which one?
坡客，坡斯廉俱樂部，最頂尖的
The Porcellian, the Porc.
It's the best of the best.
- 哪個羅斯福？
- 西奧多
- Which Roosevelt?
- Theodore.
他們說會派巴士接姑娘們參加派隊
Is it true that they send a bus around
to pick up girls
可以見到下屆鳳凰社主席，真的嗎？
who want to party with
the next Fed chairman?
所以你看到進俱樂部有多重要了吧
So you can see why
it's so important to get in.
好吧，那么進哪一個最容易？
Okay, well, which is the easiest to get into?
- 你為什么這么問？
- 我只是問問
- Why would you ask me that?
- I was just asking.
都很難，這就是我的意思
None of them. That's the point.
我朋友愛德華多炒石油一個暑假里賺了30萬
My friend Eduardo made $300,000
betting oil futures one summer
愛德華多都很難有機會入會
and Eduardo won't come close to getting in.
在這里會賺錢根本不算種本事
The ability to make money doesn't
impress anybody around here.
太厲害了，一個暑假賺30萬？
Must be nice.
He made $300,000 in a summer?
- 他喜歡氣象學
- 你剛才說的是石油期貨
- He likes meteorology.
- You said it was oil futures.
如果你能預測天氣，就能預測石油價格
You can read the weather,
you can predict the price of heating oil.
我猜你剛才那么問
I think you asked me that
是因為你覺得期末俱樂部最容易進
because you think
the final club that's easiest to get into
所以我進的機會最大
is the one where I'll have the best chance.
我…什么？
I...What?
你問我哪一個最容易進
You asked me which one was
the easiest to get into
因為你覺得我最有機會進最容易進的那個
because you think that that's the one
where I'll have the best chance.
最容易進的那個自然是最有機會進的那個
The one that's the easiest to get into
would be the one
對所有人都是
where anybody has the best chance.
你沒有問哪一個最好
You didn't ask me which one
was the best one,
你問的是哪一個最容易
you asked me which one
was the easiest one.
我沒想那么多好嗎，我只是那么一問
I was honestly just asking, okay?
I was just asking to ask.
- 馬克，我話里沒話
- 艾瑞卡
- Mark, I'm not speaking in code.
- Erica.
你一門心思要進什么期終俱樂部
You're obsessed with finals clubs.
我看你有點強迫症了，最好找個人看看
You have finals clubs OCD
and you need to see someone about it
開點藥吃吃
who will prescribe you
some sort of medication.
吃的糊里糊涂反而更好
You don't care if the side effects
may include blindness.
期末俱樂部，不是期終俱樂部
Final clubs. Not "finals clubs."
再說一門心思和積極主動是有區別的
And there's a difference between
being obsessed and being motivated.
是有區別
Yes. There is.
就是這樣，你剛才就是話里有話
Well, you do.
That was cryptic, so you do speak in code.
我不是存心這么說的
I didn't mean to be cryptic.
我的意思是我要做點讓人刮目相看的事
I'm just saying I need to do
something substantial
來引起俱樂部對我的注意
in orderto get the attention of the clubs.
- 為什么？
- 因為進俱樂部很體面
- Why?
- Because they're exclusive.
而且有趣，能讓你的生活更好
And fun, and they lead to a better life.
泰迪﹒羅斯福當選總統
Teddy Roosevelt didn't get elected president
并不是因為他曾是鳳凰社的會員
because he was a member
of the Phoenix Club.
他是坡斯廉俱樂部的
他確實因為這個當選了總統
He was a memberof the Porcellian,
and yes, he did.
行了，那你就去做你的人上人吧
Well, why don't you just concentrate
on being the best you you can be?
你什么意思？
Did you really just say that?
我開玩笑的
I was kidding.
老做派不代表就是錯誤的
Just because something's trite
doesn't make it less true.
我和你明說了吧
I wanna try to be straightforward with you
我希望你能稍微給我點支持
and tell you I think you might
want to be a little more supportive.
如果我入會了
我會帶你參加各種活動和聚會
If I get in, I will be taking you
to the events and the gatherings,
你能認識很多你平時見不到的人
and you'll be meeting a lot of people
you wouldn't normally get to meet.
你是為了我？
You would do that for me?
我們是男女朋友
We're dating.
好吧
Okay.
行了，我也和你明說了吧
Well, I wanna try and be
straightforward with you
我們不再是了
and let you know that we're not anymore.
- 什么意思？
- 我們不再是男女朋友了，很抱歉
- What do you mean?
- We're not dating anymore. I'm sorry.
- 你在開玩笑？
- 不是玩笑
- Is this a joke?
- No, it's not.
你要和我分手？
You're breaking up with me?
你會給把我介紹給那些大人物
You're gonna introduce me to people
那些我平時沒機會見到的人物
I wouldn't normally
have the chance to meet?
這對我來說有什么意義？
What the... What is that supposed to mean?
- 冷靜點
- 有什么意義？
- Wait, settle down.
- What is it supposed to mean?
艾瑞卡，我們現在能坐在這里喝東西
Erica, the reason we're able to sit here
and drink right now
是因為你和那個看門的睡過覺
is 'cause you used to sleep
with the door guy.
看門的？他叫鮑比
而且我也沒和看門的睡過覺
"The door guy'? His name is Bobby.
I have not slept with the door guy.
那看門的是我的朋友
而且他是一個很有品位的人
The door guy is a friend of mine,
and he's a perfectly good class of people.
你又算是什么出身？
And what part of Long Island
are you from, Wimbledon?
- 等一下，等一下
- 我要回宿舍了
- Wait. Wait, wait.
- I'm going back to my dorm.
- 你是認真的嗎？
- 是的
- Is this real?
- Yes.
- 那我向你道歉，行了嗎？
- 我要去自習了
- Then wait, I apologize, okay?
- I have to go study.
- 艾瑞卡？
- 怎么？
- Erica?
- Yes?
- 我真誠的向你道歉
- 感謝你的真誠，我要去自習了
- I'm sorry, I mean it.
- I appreciate that, but I have to go study.
別這樣，你不用自習，我們談談吧
Come on, you don't have to study.
Let's just talk.
- 不行
- 為什么？
- I can't.
- Why?
因為我累了，和你約會就像在和爬樓機約會
Because it is exhausting.
Dating you is like dating a StairMaster.
我的意思就是你用不著…馬上就…
All I meant is that you're not likely to...
Currently...
我又沒對你的外貌評頭論足
I wasn't making a comment
on your appearance.
我只是在說事實
就像我說你在波士頓學院讀書一樣
I was saying that you go to BU.
I was stating a fact, that's all,
如果你覺得我很粗魯，那我道歉
and if it seemed rude, then I apologize.
- 我要去自習了
- 你不用去自習
- I have to go study.
- You don't have to study.
你為什么一直說我不用去自習？
Why do you keep saying
I don't have to study?
因為你上的是波士頓
'Cause you go to BU.
你想吃點什么嗎？
Do you want to get some food?
很抱歉我的學習成績入不了你的眼
I am sorry you are not sufficiently
impressed with my education.
我也很抱歉我沒有皮划艇，我們扯平了
And I'm sorry I don't have a rowboat,
so we're even.
- 我們還是做朋友吧
- 我不需要朋友
- I think we should just be friends.
- I don't want friends.
我只是客氣而已
I was just being polite.
我才不想和你做朋友
I have no intention
of being friends with you.
編程課讓我壓力很大
I'm under some pressure right now
from my OS class
點吃的吧，也許我們可以…
and if we could just order some food,
I think we should...
聽著，也許你將來
能成為一個很成功的電腦人
Okay, you are probably going to be
a very successful computer person.
但你會發現你這一輩子都沒有女孩喜歡
But you're gonna go through life
thinking that girls don't like you
你覺得那是因為你是個書呆子
because you're a nerd.
但說真心話，我要告訴你你想錯了
And I want you to know from the bottom
of my heart that that won't be true.
沒女孩喜歡你，那是因為你是個混蛋
lt'll be because you're an asshole.

2003年秋，哈佛大學
柯克蘭學生宿舍
艾瑞卡﹒奧布萊特是個賤人
Erica Albright's a bitch.
是不是因為他們家族把姓氏
從阿爾布雷克特改成奧布萊特
Do you think that's because her family
changed their name from Albrecht,
或許波士頓女生都是賤人
or do you think it's because
all BU girls are bitches?
看內衣標簽，她的胸圍確實是34C
For the record, she may look like a 34C,
天曉得她求內衣店的朋友幫了多少忙
but she's getting all kinds of help
from our friends at Victoria's Secret.
她是34B，平的像個飛機場，用假尺寸騙人
She's a 34B, as in barely anything there.
False advertising.
不能否認她臉蛋很美
The truth is, she has a nice face.
我需要點時間才能忘記那張臉
I need to do something
to take my mind off her.
很簡單，想件事情做做
Easy enough, except I need an idea.
我有點發酒瘋，我承認這點
I'm a little intoxicated, I'm not gonna lie.
盡管現在還不到10點，也不是周末
So what if it's not even 10:00 p.m.
and it's a Tuesday night?
比利
Billy.
我打開柯克蘭的同學錄
The Kirkland facebook
is open on my desktop,
有些人上傳了自己的看家照
and some of these people have
pretty horrendous facebook pics.
比利﹒奧森坐在那里提議把這些人的照片
和牲口的照片放在一起
Billy Olson's sitting here and had
the idea of putting some of the pictures
做個投票讓大家選誰更漂亮
next to pictures of farm animals
and have people vote on who's hotter.
好主意，奧森先生
Good call, Mr. Olson.
沒錯，感覺來了，我不准備拿牲口的照片比
Yeah, it's on.
I'm not gonna do the farm animals,
把兩個人放在一起比，我喜歡這主意
but I like the idea of comparing
two people together.
很有一種人工智能的感覺
It gives the whole thing a very "Turing" feel
直接選擇照片會更加直觀
since people's ratings of the pictures
will be more implicit
比在辣妹網上打分
than, say, choosing a number to
represent each person's hotness,
更有意思
like they do on hotornot.com.
首先我們需要大量的照片
The first thing we're going to need
is a lot of pictures.
可惜哈佛沒有給所有學生做同學錄
Unfortunately, Harvard doesn't keep
a public centralized facebook,
所以要逐一從各個宿舍樓的分站
so I'm going to have to get all the images
去下載每個人的照片
from the individual houses
that people are in.
黑客時間
Let the hacking begin.
首先是柯克蘭
First up is Kirkland.
所有內容都是公開的
并允許對阿帕奇服務器配置文件進行索引
They keep everything open and allow
indexes in their Apache configuration.
只需要一個小小的下載軟件
就能搞定整個柯克蘭
So a little Wget magic is all that's necessary
to download the entire Kirkland facebook.
小菜一碟
Kids' stuff.
接下來是艾略特
Next is Eliot.
也是公開的，但無法對服務器進行索引
They're also open,
but with no indexes on Apache.
把搜索關鍵詞設為空
I can run an empty search
就能將所有照片文件集中在一個頁面
and it returns all of the images
in the database in a single page.
只需要保存這個頁面
謀智網絡會幫我保存每一張照片
And I can save the page and Mozilla
will save all the images for me.
太好了，一切進展順利
Excellent. Moving right along.
大家靜一靜
Excuse me! Everybody!
你們的社團歷史悠久，陣容豪華
You are at one of the oldest,
one of the most exclusive clubs,
是哈佛乃至全世界最頂級的社團之一
not just at Harvard, but in the world.
歡迎大家參加
And I want to welcome you all
鳳凰社首場秋季派對
to Phoenix Club's first party
of the fall semester!
洛厄爾有安全認証，需要用戶名和密碼
Lowell has some security.
They require a user name/password combo,
只要把這里改成他們無權進入主數據庫
and I'm gonna go ahead and say they don't
have access to the main FAS user database,
他們就沒辦法檢測到黑客程序
so they have no way
of detecting an intrusion.
亞當沒有安全認証但有限制
最多只能下載20頁
Adams has no security, but limits
the number of results to 20 a page.
在同一個腳本處做一下修改就成了
和洛厄爾的處理方式一樣
All I need to do is break out the same script
I used on Lowell and we're set.
昆西沒有網上同學錄，真可惜
Quincy has no online facebook.
What a sham.
這就沒法子了
Nothing I can do about that.
鄧斯特有點莫名
Dunster is intense.
他們沒有公共目錄，根本沒有目錄
Not only is there no public directory,
but there's no directory at all.
必須手動檢索
You have to do searches,
如果超過20項符合，就顯示檢索失敗
and if your search returns more
than 20 matches, nothing gets returned.
就算檢索成功，檢索項也無法直接連到照片
And once you do get results,
they don't link directly to the images.
他們連接PHP并重新定向，怪事
They link to a PHP that redirects
or something. Weird.
這有點難度，稍后再處理
This may be difficult. I'll come back later.
- 嘿，《鯊魚周》開始播了
- 什么？
- Hey, Shark Week's on.
- What?
- 漂亮的大白魚
- 很好
- Great white, beautiful fish.
- Nice.
萊弗里特稍微容易些
他們也要求你提供搜索條件
Leverett is a little better.
They still make you search,
但你可以提供空的搜索條件
對方就能顯示所有學生的照片
but you can do an empty search and get
links to pages with every student's picture.
煩人的是每次只能看一張
It's slightly obnoxious that they
only let you view one picture at a time,
整整500張，我不可能一張張去下載
and there's no way I'm going to go
to 500 pages to download pics one at a time.
必須進入文本管理修改一下腳本
So it's definitely necessary to break out
Emacs and modify that Perl script.
接著
Here you go.
完成
Done.
嘿，你們好嗎？
Hey, what's going on?
時間剛好，愛德華多回來了
關鍵的部分在他手中
Perfect timing. Eduardo's here
and he's going to have the key ingredient.
- 嘿，馬克
- 華多
- Hey, Mark.
- Wardo.
你和艾瑞卡吹了
You and Erica split up.
你怎么知道？
How did you know that?
我看過你博客了
It's on your blog.
- 是啊
- 你沒事吧？
- Yeah.
- Are you all right?
- 我需要你
- 我就在這兒
- I need you.
- I'm here for you.
不，我需要你排列國際象棋的那個公式
No, I need the algorithm you use
to rank chess players.
- 什么情況？
- 我們給姑娘們做排名
- Are you okay?
- We're ranking girls.
- 你是說這里的學生？
- 是
- You mean other students.
- Yeah.
這不太好吧
You think this is such a good idea?
- 我需要公式
- 馬克…
- I need the algorithm.
- Mark...
我需要公式
I need the algorithm.
每個姑娘基礎分值為1400
Give each girl a base rating of 1400.
一個女孩分值表示為Ra，另一個為Rb
At any given time Girl A has a rating R-a
and Girl B has a rating R-b.
兩個放在一起根據她們當前的分值
When any two girls are matched up,
there's an expectation of which will win
就能算出期望值，從而得出勝負，對嗎？
based on their current rating, right?
期望值的表達式就是這樣的
Yeah. And those expectations
are expressed this way.
就這么寫
Let's write it.
左邊那個
One on the left.
右邊的
The right.
還是右邊的
Yeah, still the right.
- 成功了
- 先發給誰好呢
- It works.
- Who should we send it to first?
- 德懷爾
- 尼爾
- Dwyer.
- Neal.
- 你准備發給誰？
- 隨便發几個
- Who are you gonna send it to?
- Just a couple of people.
問題是
The question is,
他們又會轉發給誰？
who are they gonna send it to?
伙計們，來看看這個
Hey, guys, check this out.
選左邊那個，伙計，左邊的
Someone go to the left. Dude, do left.
看看這些姑娘，右邊還是左邊？
Look at these girls. Right or left?
- 左邊這個更辣
- 左邊？對，對
- Left is hot.
- Left? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
右邊還是左邊？
Right or left?
那是我的室友
That's my roommate.
- 上帝啊
- 左邊那姑娘
- Oh, my God.
- The girl on the left.
杯具
This is pathetic.
右邊
Right.
左邊
Left.
- 左邊
- 左邊？
- Left.
- Left?
混蛋
Oh, shit.
奧布萊特
Albright.
他把你寫進博客了
He blogged about you.
你還是別看的好
You don't wanna read it.
左邊
Left.
拉美組織的
Latina.
艾瑞卡
Erica.
這是你的嗎？
Is this yours?
我從人妖那兒偷來的
I stole it from a tranny.
滾出去！
Get the hell out of here!
- 左邊
- 右邊那個
- Left.
- One on the right.
左邊
Left.
沒見過這么大流量
Man, thats an awful lot of traffic.
是不是該收手了，別惹出麻煩
You think maybe we shouldn't shut it down
before we get into trouble?
喂？
Hello?
慢點，慢點
Wait, wait, wait, wait. What?
凌晨4點？
At 4:00 in the morning?
柯克蘭分站的數據流量出現異常
Well, there's a very unusual amount
of traffic to the switch at Kirkland.
是和平時的凌晨4點比較？
You're saying it's unusual
for 4:00 in the morning?
超過超級杯（美式足球聯盟冠軍賽）
中場休息時的量
No, this'd be unusual
for halftime at the Super Bowl.
好吧
All right.
我要去辦公室
I gotta go in.
怎么了？
What's going on?
哈佛的網絡快癱瘓了
Harvard's network is about to crash.
不會是…
You don't think...
應該是
I do.
每個人都檢查一下自己的
Go see if it's everybody's.
連不上了
I can't connect.
網絡癱了
The network's down.
不出意外的話，這是我們造成的
Unless it's a coincidence, I think this is us.
你猜對了
It's not a coincidence.
見鬼
Holy shit.
你被校委會叫去問話了？
So you were called in front of the Ad Board.
不是這樣的
That's not what happened.
你沒有被校委會叫去問話嗎？
You weren't called in front
of the Administrative Board?
是后來，跟艾瑞卡﹒奧布萊特
在酒吧分開以后，這是她說的嗎？
No, back. I mean back at the bar
with Erica Albright. She said all that?
- 馬克…
- 她說我當面對她說了這些話？
- Mark...
- That I said that stuff to her?
這是她的証詞上寫的
I was reading from the transcript
of her deposition.
她和這案子有什么關系？
Yeah, why would you even need
to depose her?
這由我們決定
That's really for us to decide.
你覺得讓我知道我在她那兒有把柄
我就會合作嗎？
You think if I know she can make me
look like a jerk, I'll be more likely to settle.
不如休息一會兒吧
Why don't we stretch our legs for a minute?
可以嗎？都問了快3小時了
Can we do that?
It's been almost three hours.
老實說，大部分時間你都在想方設法
另扎克伯格先生難堪
And frankly, you did spend an awful lot
of time embarrassing Mr. Zuckerberg
竟然還提到那晚在酒吧的事
with the girl's testmony from the bar.
我才不難堪，難堪的是她
I'm not embarrassed,
she just made a lot of that up.
她宣誓過了
She was under oath.
那這就是有史以來第一次
有人一邊宣誓一邊撒謊
Then I guess that would be the first time
somebody's lied under oath.
2小時內站點點擊率達到2200？
The site got 2,200 hits within two hours?
再加個零
Thousand.
多少？
What?
Twenty-two thousand.
Wow.
划的太他媽快了
These guys are just freakin' fast.
怎樣才能讓這比賽公平些？
Is there any way to make this a fair fight?
跳船游泳過去
Jump out and swim.
不如我們跳船沉到湖底算了
I think we'd have to jump out and drown.
要不你往前划我往后划
Well, you could row forward
and I could row backward.
我們是雙胞胎，要同進同退
We're geneticaly identical.
Science says we'd stay in one place.
划你的船吧
Just row the damn boat.
- 聽說了嗎？
- 什么？
- You guys hear about this?
- What?
兩天前，柯克蘭的一個二年級學生
用一台筆記本沖垮了學校的網絡
Two nights ago, a sophomore choked
the network from a aptop at Kirkland.
- 是嗎？
- 凌晨4點
- Really?
- At 4:00 a.m.
怎么會？
How?
他建了一個辣妹評選的投票網站
He set up a website where you vote
on the hotness of female undergrads.
我們在干嘛，怎么一點都不知道
What were we doing
that none of us heard about this?
不知道
I don't know.
早餐前3小時低強度划船訓練
A three-hour low-rate
technical row before breakfast.
課程排的很滿，在學習
Full course load. Studying.
模擬划船3小時，然后再學習
Another three hours in the tank
and then studying.
說不清那個時候在干什么
I'm not sure how we missed it.
一共有多少點擊率？
How much activity was there on this thing?
22000次
Twenty-two thousand page requests.
22000？
Twenty-two thousand?
卡梅倫，這家伙黑了7個宿舍的同學錄
Cam, this guy hacked
the facebook of seven houses.
他一夜之間就完成了整個網站搭建
還是在喝醉的狀態下
He set up the whole website in one night,
and he did it while he was drunk.
22000？
Twenty-two thousand?
- 你怎么知道他喝醉了？
- 他在博客上直播了整個過程
- Well, how do you know he was drunk?
- He was blogging simutaneously.
- 知道我在想什么嗎？
- 早就想到了
- You know what I think?
- Way ahead of you.
這就是我們要找的人
This is our guy.
卡梅倫﹒文克萊沃斯
Cameron Winklevoss.
W-I-N-K-L-E-V-O-S-S
W-I-N-K-L-E-V-O-S-S.
卡梅倫是常規拼法
"Cameron" spelled the usual way.
泰勒﹒文克萊沃斯
Tyler Winklevoss.
泰勒是常規拼法，姓氏和我哥哥一樣
Tyler spelled the usual way, and my
last name is the same as my brother's.
扎克伯格先生，校委聽証會現在開始
Mr. Zuckerberg, this is
an Administrative Board hearing.
你的網站www.facemash.com
You're being accused
of intentionally breaching security,
涉嫌故意妨礙公共安全
violating copyrights,
侵犯版權，侵犯個人隱私
violating individual privacy
by creating the website www.facemash.com.
同時你被控違反校規
You're also charged with
being in violation of university policy,
私自將學生照片對外發布
on distribution of digitized images.
開始提問前，你可以先做一個聲明
Before we begin with our questioning,
you're allowed to make a statement.
有什么要說的嗎？
Would you like to do so?
我…
I...
我已經在校報上刊登了道歉信
對黑人女學生協會
You know, I've already apologized
in The Crimson to the ABHW,
對拉丁美洲女子問題組織
to Fuerza Latina,
以及對哈佛所有受到侮辱的女學生
and to any women at Harvard
who may have been insulted,
表示道歉
as I take it that they were.
至于說到破壞公共安全
As for any charges stemming
from the breach of security,
我反而覺得我應該受到校委會的嘉獎
I believe I deserve
some recognition from this board.
- 你說什么？
- 沒錯
- I'm sorry?
- Yes.
我聽不懂
I don't understand.
哪部分？
Which part?
你應該得到嘉獎？
You deserve recognition?
你們的系統有大漏洞，而我發現了它們
I believe I've pointed out
some pretty gaping holes in your system.
- 抱歉，我能說一句嗎？
- 可以
- Excuse me, may I?
- Yes.
扎克伯格先生
Mr. Zuckerberg,
我是哈佛計算機網絡安全負責人
I'm in charge of security
for all computers on the Harvard network,
你的做法相當小兒科
and I can assure you of its sophistication.
我們用了不到4小時就找到了你的位置
In fact, it was that level of sophistication
that led us to you in less than four hours.
- 4小時
- 沒錯，先生
- Four hours?
- Yes, sir.
算不錯了
That would be impressive,
可惜你們沒看到
你們花那么多時間找的東西
except if you had known
what you were looking for,
就寫在我宿舍的玻璃窗上
you would have seen it
written on my dorm room window.
怎么樣？
So?
留校觀察六個月
Six months academic probation.
他們要殺雞儆猴
Wow. Well, they had to make
an example out of you.
他們取消了我的博客
They had my blog.
也許我不該寫牲口之類的話
I shouldn't have written
that thing about the farm animals.
太傻了
That was stupid.
我只是開開玩笑
上帝啊，這里的人難道沒有一點幽默感？
But I was kidding, for God's sakes.
Doesn't anybody have a sense of humor?
- 我早說了讓你收手
- 我知道
- I tried to stop you.
- I know.
現在所有的姑娘都恨透我們了
How do you do this thing where
you manage to get all girls to hate us?
- 我當時竟然還推波助瀾
- 我明白
- And why do I let you?
- I know.
- 你不該這么做
- 華多，我知道錯了
- You can't do that.
- Wardo, I said I know.
好了，讓我們來舉個例子
Okay, let's look at a sample problem.
假設一台計算機擁有16位虛擬地址
Suppose we're given a computer
with a 16-bit virtual address
分頁256字節
and a page size of 256 bytes.
系統使用16進制
地址400開始的一級代碼頁表
The system uses one-level page tables
that start at address hex 400.
也許可以在16位系統中
使用直接存儲器存取，隨便吧
Maybe you want DMA on your 16-bit system.
Who knows?
你大爺的
The frst few pages are reserved
for hardware flags, etc.
前几頁必須留給硬盤分區
如果頁表項有八個狀態位
Assume page-table entries have
eight status bits.
會是哪八個呢…
The eight status bits would then be...
誰來回答？
Anybody?
我看到了第一個逃兵
And I see we have our first surrender.
別灰心，扎克伯格先生
Don't worry, Mr. Zuckerberg.
比你聰明的人也沒能答出來
Brghter men than you
have tried and failed this cass.
1個有效位，1個修改位，1個參考位
5個權限位
One valid bit, one modified bit,
one reference bit and five permission bits.
回答正確
That is correct.
有誰知道這是怎么運算出來的嗎？
Does everybody see how he got there?
馬克？
Mark?
- 你是馬克﹒扎克伯格？
- 對
- You Mark Zuckerberg?
- Yeah.
- 卡梅倫﹒文克萊沃斯
- 嗨
- Cameron Winklevoss.
- Hi.
泰勒﹒文克萊沃斯
Tyler Winklevoss.
你們是親戚？
Are you guys related?
- 很有眼力
- 有意思
- That's good.
- Funny.
還沒人這么問過
We never heard that before.
找我什么事，來替女朋友出頭？
So, what can I do for you?
Did I insult your girlfriends?
不是，不知道怎么開口
No. You didn't. Actually, I don't know.
- 我們不太求人的
- 還是說吧
- Yeah, we never asked.
- We should do that.
不是
No.
我們有一個創意，想找你聊聊
We have an idea
we want to talk to you about.
有時間嗎？
You got a minute?
你們看上去練過几下子
You guys look like
you spend some time at the gym.
- 我們必須得練
- 為什么？
- We have to.
- Why?
我們是賽艇隊的
We row crew.
- 好，我跟你們走
- 太好了
- Yeah I've got a minute.
- Great.
- 你從沒去過坡斯廉俱樂部吧？
- 沒有
- So, you ever been inside the Porcellian?
- No.
我們只能安排你到門廊，希望你理解
You understand we can't take you
past the bike room,
因為你不是會員
because you're not a member.
我聽說過
I've heard.
- 要三明治嗎？
- 好的
- You want a sandwich or something?
- Okay.
- 是馬克吧？
- 對
- Mark, right?
- Yeah.
- 馬克，我來介紹，迪夫亞﹒倫德拉，我們的搭檔
- 嗨
- Mark, this is Divya Narendra, our partner.
- Hi.
Facemash讓我們大吃一驚
We were really impressed with Facemash.
我們去查過，課程表系統也是你建的
When we checked you out,
you also built CourseMatch.
什么課程表
I don't know CourseMatch.
只需上網就能查到你的朋友在上哪些課程
You go online and see
what courses your friends are taking.
太聰明了，伙計
It's really smart, man.
- 馬克
- 怎么
- Mark.
- Yeah.
我們在談你的課程表系統
We were talking about CourseMatch.
傻瓜都會做
It was kind of a no-brainer.
你高中的時候也有一項發明是嗎？
But you invented something
in high school, too, right?
為隨身聽設計的一款程序
可以識別客戶對音樂的喜好
An app for an MP3 player
that recognizes your taste in music.
有人來買嗎？
Anybody try to buy it?
微軟
Microsoft.
開價多少？
Wow. How much?
我沒賣，免費下載
Didn't sell it. Uploaded it for free.
- 免費？
- 對
- For free?
- Yeah.
為什么？
Why?
好了，我們有一個創意，做了有段時間了
Okay, well, we have something
that we've been working on for a while
我們覺得很棒
and we think it's great.
叫做哈佛連線
It's called the Harvard Connection.
你創建自己的頁面，上面有你的興趣愛好
簡歷，朋友圈，照片
You create your own page.
Interests, bio, friends, pics.
然后大家可以上網瀏覽你的頁面
加你為好友…
And then people can go online,
see your bio, request to be your...
和別的交友網站有什么區別？
Yeah, how is that different
from MySpace or Friendster?
哈佛的域名
Harvard.edu.
Harvard.edu是整個國家
最有聲望的電子郵箱地址
Harvard.edu is the most prestigious
e-mail address in the country, man.
整個網站的創意是姑娘們…
I mean, the whole site's kind of
based on the idea that girls...
我不是那種猥瑣的意思…
Not to put anything indelicately, but...
姑娘們可以和哈佛男生約會
Girls wanna go with guys
who go to Harvard.
迪夫亞和我弟弟不介意直接說這些
Divya and my brother don't have trouble
putting things indelicately.
和類似我的空間這樣的普通社交網站
The main difference between what we're
talking about and MySpace or Friendster,
最大的區別就是…
or any of those other
social networking sites is...
體面，是不是？
Is exclusivity. Right?
- 沒錯
- 對
- Right.
- Yeah.
希望你能與我們合作，馬克
We'd love for you to work with us, Mark.
我們需要一個有創造力有天賦的編程員
I mean, we need a gifted programmer
who's creative.
我們知道你現在挺郁悶的
And we know that
you've been taking it in the shins.
姑娘們已經不待見你了
Women's groups are ready
to declare a fatwa.
這能幫助你恢復形象
But, you know, this could help
rehabilitate your image.
你們真有心
Wow. You would do that for me?
我們愿意找你合作
We'd like to work with you.
我們上一個程序員畢業以后進了谷歌
Our first programmer graduated
and went to work for Google.
第二個程序員學業太緊張抽不開身
Our second programmer
just got overwhelmed with schoolwork.
我們需要你架構網站，寫代碼
我們會提供一切…
We would need you to build the site and
write the code, and we'll provide all the...
我加入
I'm in.
什么？
What?
我加入
I'm in.
太好了
Awesome.
你是這么說的？
That's what you said?
都過了3、4年了，我不記得了
It was three or four years ago.
I don't know what I said.
你是什么時候去找愛德華多的？
When did you come to Eduardo?
什么意思
I don't understand that question.
你肯定的回答他們了嗎？
Do you remember answering
in the affirmative?
肯定的？
The affirmative?
你是什么時候
去找愛德華多談Facebook這個創意的？
When did you come to Eduardo
with the idea for Facebook?
當時沒有Facebook，你真是未卜先知
It was called The Facebook then.
直說了吧
This doesn't need to be that difficult.
我現在同時陷在兩個官司里
I'm currently in the middle
of two different lawsuits.
你的回答是肯定的嗎？
Did you answer affirmatively
文氏兄弟和迪夫亞﹒倫德拉
讓你幫他們做哈佛連線時
when Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss
and Divya Narendra
你有沒有肯定的回答他們？
asked you to build Harvard Connection?
你答應他們了嗎？
Did you say yes?
我說了我可以幫忙
I said I'd help.
你在什么時候找到薩維林先生
交涉關于Facebook的創意？
When did you approach Mr. Saverin
with the idea for The Facebook?
我不喜歡交涉這個詞
I wouldn't say I approached him.
- 塞
- 請回答問題
- Sy.
- You can answer the question.
兄弟會的派對
At a party at Apha Epsilon Pi.
什么？
What's that?
猶太兄弟會
The Jewish fraternity.
加勒比海之夜
It was Caribbean Night.
像我這種人一般不受亞洲女孩待見
It's not that guys like me
are generally attracted to Asian girls.
但亞洲女孩怎么就那么吸引我這種人呢
It's that Asian girls are
generally attracted to guys like me.
我正在做一套公式
I'm developing an algorithm
to define the connection
定義猶太男孩和亞洲女孩之間的關系
between Jewish guys and Asian girls.
我覺得沒那么復雜，她們又辣又聰明
I don't think it's that complicated.
They're hot, they're smart,
她們沒有猶太血統，也不會跳舞
they're not Jewish, and they can't dance.
嘿，馬克來了
Hey, Mark's here.
馬克
Mark!
一會兒就回來
Be right back.
我有個想法
I think I've come up with something.
等等，先讓我說，你決不會相信的
Hang on. I gotta tell you something
that you're not gonna believe.
什么？
What?
鳳凰社要我了
I got punched by the Phoenix.
- 你開玩笑？
- 真的
- Are you kidding?
- No.
總共四場面試，這是第一場
I mean, it's just the first
of a four-step process,
他們往宿舍門里塞邀請信了，就今晚的事
but they slid the invitation
under my door tonight.
明天是我的第一場潘趣酒會（迎新酒會）
I go to my first punch party tomorrow.
這么說…
So...
你要進鳳凰社了
You got punched by the Phoenix.
知道嗎，也許因為我是猶太人
Yeah, but, you know,
it was probably just a diversity thing.
或許他們是想吸收多種族的會員
那我就借著這股風…
It was just a diversity thing.
Just ride that horse until...
你想說什么來著？
What did you wanna talk to me about?
- 馬克？
- 是的
- Mark?
- Yeah.
你剛才說你有個想法
You said you'd come up with something.
沒錯，我有個想法，我們到外面說
Yeah, I think I've come up with something.
Come outside and let's talk.
外面只有零下六度
It's 20 degrees outside.
我可不想盯著這個假瀑布看
I can't stare at that loop of Niagara Falls,
它和加勒比海半毛錢關系都沒有
which has absolutely
nothing to do with the Caribbean.
大家爭先恐后的上Facemash是嗎？
People came to Facemash
in a stampede, right?
是的
Yeah.
并不是因為他們愛看辣妹照
But it wasn't because
they saw pictures of hot girls.
這種照片在網上一抓一大把
You can go anywhere on the Internet
and see pictures of hot girls.
對
Yeah.
而是因為這些姑娘都是他們認識的
It was because they saw pictures
of girls that they knew.
人們希望能夠上網了解朋友的動向
People want to go on the Internet
and check out their friends,
為什么我們不建一個這樣的網站呢？
so why not build a website that offers that?
朋友，照片，檔案，所有你想要看的
Friends, pictures, profiles,
whatever you can visit.
可以隨意瀏覽
哪怕是你剛在聚會上認識的人
Browse around.
Maybe it's someone you just met at a party.
但我說的不是交友論壇那種
But I'm not talking about a dating site.
我的意思是把整個大學社交圈全部搬上網絡
I'm talking about taking the entire social
experience of college and puttng it online.
- 我的腿凍僵了
- 我知道
- I can't feel my legs.
- I know.
我也激動的快僵了，但是華多
I'm totaly psyched about this, too.
But, Wardo?
什么？
Yeah?
這很體面
"It wou d be exclusive."
你通過自己的主頁去交朋友
You would have to know the people
on the site to get past your own page.
就像申請社團
Like getting punched.
這倒不錯
Now, that's good.
華多，這就是一個期末俱樂部
而我們就像俱樂部主席
Wardo, it's like a final club,
except we're the president.
我對他說這主意聽上去棒極了
I told him I thought it sounded great.
絕妙的主意
It was a great idea.
根本不需要去盜取信息
There was nothing to hack.
人們會主動提供他們的照片和信息
People were gonna provide
their own pictures, their own information.
也可以選擇邀請誰為好友
And people had the ability to invite,
or not invite, their friends to join.
在這個社交圈決定一切的社會里
See, in a world where
social structure was everything,
他就是一把鑰匙
that was the thing.
項目很龐大
It was a big project,
他得寫成千上萬條代碼
and he was going to have to write
tens of thousands of lines of code,
所以我奇怪他為什么來找我
而不去找他的室友
so I wondered why he was
coming to me and not his roommates,
達斯汀﹒莫斯科維茨，克里斯﹒休斯
他們是程序員
Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes.
They were programmers.
我們需要一些啟動資金
用來租服務器挂網站
We're gonna need a little start-up cash
to rent the servers and get it online.
這就是為什么
So that was why.
- 他和你談條件了嗎？
- 談了
- Did he offer terms?
- Yes.
三七分賬
We'll split it 70/30.
我七你三，你提供1000美元啟動資金
70 for me, 30 for you
for putting up the $1,000
你做首席財務官
處理和財務有關的所有事物
and for handling everything
on the business end. You're CFO.
你怎么回答？
And you said?
我說，那就干吧
I said, "Let's do it."
好，他還說了什么嗎？
Okay. Did he add anything else?
是的
Yes.
也許確實因為你是猶太人
It probably was a diversity thing.
但又怎樣？
But so what?
你覺得他為什么那樣說？
Why do you think he said that?
格雷琴，原諒我打斷你，這問題誰想出來的？
Gretchen, excuse me for interrupting,
but whose discovery is this?
塞，讓我問完我所有問題好嗎？
Sy, if you'll let me continue
with my line of questioning.
你在暗示什么？
What are you suggesting?
你的意思是我嫉妒愛德華多可以進鳳凰社
That I was jealous of Eduardo
for getting punched by the Phoenix
所以就想出個計划搞砸他的好事
and began a plan
to screw him out of a company
- 我想都沒想過
- 你有嗎？
- I hadn't even invented yet.
- Were you?
- 格雷琴
- 嫉妒愛德華多？
- Gretchen.
- Jealous of Eduardo?
別打了，這和本案無關
Stop typing. We're off the record.
女士，我知道你做了很多調查
Ma'am, I know you've done your homework,
雖然我對錢并不看重
and so you know that money
isn't a big part of my life.
但此時此刻，我有能力買下整條奧本山街
But at the moment,
I could buy Mount Auburn Street,
把鳳凰俱樂部變成我的私人乒乓球房
take the Phoenix Club
and turn it into my ping-pong room.
回頭告訴你舞會的事
I'll let you know how the party is.
我們了解
你在針對Facebook的一個案子中作為原告
We recognize that you're a plaintiff
in one suit involving Facebook,
同時在另一個案件中又作為証人
and a witness in another.
是的，先生
Yes, sir.
在馬克告訴你他的想法之前的几周
At any time in the weeks
prior to Mark's telling you his idea,
他有提到過文氏兄弟嗎？
did he mention Tyler Winklevoss,
Cameron Winklevoss,
或者提到迪夫亞﹒倫德拉和哈佛連線？
Divya Narendra or Harvard Connection?
是的，他說過他們請他做網站
Yes. He said they'd asked him
to work on their site,
但他看過他們的材料，覺得不值得幫他們做
but that he looked at what they had
and decided it wasn't worth his time.
他說就算是他最沒人緣的朋友
He said even his most pathetic friends
也比這些家伙更懂得如何吸引大眾上網
knew more about getting people
interested in a website than these guys.
這些家伙，指的是我的委托人
"These guys," meaning my clients.
是的，他感到很憤怒
你的委托人說這事能幫他恢復形象
Yes. He resented...
Mark resented that your clients thought
馬克對此感到很憤怒
that he needed to rehabilitate
his image after Facemash.
馬克根本沒想過恢復形象什么的
But Mark didn't want
to rehabilitate anything.
為了做Facemash他可以黑哈佛的電腦
With Facemash, he'd hacked into
the Harvard computers,
他連校委會都不放在眼里
更不在乎得到罵名
he'd thumbed his nose at the Ad Board,
he'd gotten a lot of notoriety.
做Facemash就是他的本意
Facemash did exacty
what he wanted it to do.
你是否知道當扎克伯格先生建立Facebook時
Were you aware that while Mr. Zuckerberg
was building The Facebook,
他和本案原告也保持著聯系？
he was also communicating
with the plaintiffs?
當時不知道，但是…
Not at the time, I wasn't. But...
反正這和姓文的交友網站根本不是一碼事
It really didn't have much to do
with the Winklevosses' dating site.
你怎么知道？你又不在場
How would you know?
You weren't even there.
塞
Ty.
你是否知道當扎克伯格先生建立Facebook時
Were you aware that while Mr. Zuckerberg
was building The Facebook,
他同時在誤導本案原告
相信他正在建立哈佛連線
he was leading the plaintiffs to believe
he was building Harvard Connection?
還沒有証據前請不要妄下結論
You're offering a conclusion
not found in evidence.
我現在就提供証據
We are about to find it in evidence.

2003年11月30日
November 30th, 2003.
我讀了你們發給我的關于哈佛連線的材料
"I read over all the stuff you sent me
re: Harvard Connection.
執行起來并不需要很長時間
"And it seems like it shouldn't
take too long to implement.
我會把基礎框架先搭好，明晚見面詳談

the basic functionality up tomorrow night."

本周太忙了，課程和功課排得滿滿的
"This week has been pretty busy
thus far with classes and work,
會議還是延期吧
"so I think it's probably best
to postpone the meeting."
明天也很忙
"I'm also really busy tomorrow."
你們覺不覺得這家伙有點古怪？
Okay, anybody else feel like
there's something up with this guy?
告訴他行
Tell him okay,
但是放假之前必須要見一次面
but we do have to make sure that
we meet up before we all go off for break.
我知道，好的，小心點
I know, I know. Yeah, watch out.
嘿，馬克
Hey, Mark.
我需要一台專業的服務器運行數據庫終端
I need a dedicated Linux box
running Apache with a MySQL back end.
需要再花點錢
It's gonna cost a lttle more money.
- 多少？
- 大約200美金
- How much more?
- About 200 more.
- 一定要嗎？
- 得解決流量問題
- Do we need it?
- Gotta handle the traffic.
- 買吧
- 我已經買了
- Do it
- I already did.
你猜怎么著？
Hey, guess what?
我要參加第二場面試了
I made the second cut.
很好
That's good.
已經很不錯了，過不了也別灰心
You should be proud of that right there.
Don't worry if you don't make it any further.
我出去了
I'll get out of here.

December 15th, 2003.
我必須處理一個cs服務器問題
"I have a CS problem set
that I'm just gettng started with
得花15小時寫代碼，明天要忙一晚上
"and t should be about 15 hours of coding,
so I'll be busy tomorrow night."
下周三下午之前恐怕沒時間見你們了
"I won't really be free to meet
until next Wednesday afternoon."
周三下午取消會面
"I have to cancel Wednesday afternoon.
我得呆在實驗室
"I've basically been in the lab
this whole time and also I..."
周六也不行，我父母來看我
"...won't be able to do Saturday,
as I have to meet up with my parents."
這個牌匾上寫著
約翰﹒哈佛于1638年建立哈佛大學
As the plaque reads, this is John Harvard,
founder of Harvard University in 1638.
它也叫三個謊言之雕像
It's also called the Statue of Three Lies.
哪三個謊言？
What are the three lies?
道得先生
Mr Dowd.
三個謊言，第一…
The three lies. First...
見鬼！
Shit!
- 把褲子脫了
- 我知道的
- Take your pants off.
- I know.
薩維林先生
Mr. Saverin.
第一，哈佛建于1636年，不是1638年
One, Harvard was founded in 1636, not 1638.
第二，哈佛的創辦者不是約翰﹒哈佛
Two, Harvard was not founded
by John Harvard.
第三，雕像不是約翰﹒哈佛
And three, that is not John Harvard.
那是誰？
Who is it?
是雕刻家的一個朋友，丹尼爾﹒徹斯特
It's a friend of the sculptor, Daniel Chester.
留著你的夾克吧
Keep your jacket on.
我的委托人和扎克伯格先生
第一次見面后39天
Thirty-nine days after Mr Zuckerberg's
initial meeting with my clients,
他還沒有完成哈佛連線的工作
and he still hadn't completed work
on Harvard Connection.
但在2004年1月11日
But on January 11th, 2004,
扎克伯格先生通過無線網絡解決方案
Mr. Zuckerberg registered
the domain name The Facebook
注冊了Facebook的域名
via Network Solutions.
據你所知，他究竟有沒有在做哈佛連線？
To the best of your knowledge, had he even
begun work on Harvard Connection?
據我所知，沒有
Not to my knowledge. No.
這又算什么？
What in the world is this?
卡梅倫，我覺得網站的功能性不夠
"Hey, Cameron, I'm still a little skeptical
that we have enough functionality in the site
對大眾缺乏吸引力
"to really draw the attention
and gain the crtical mass necessary
這樣的網站估計沒搞頭
"to get a site like this to run"?
找時間談談吧
"We'll speak soon"?
這是他第一次提出疑問？
This is the first time
he mentioned any problem?
是的
Yes, it was.
你們一共發給扎克伯格先生36封郵件
收到他的回信16封
You sent 36 e-mails to Mr. Zuckerberg
and received 16 e-mails in return,
這是他第一次表示他不滿意
and this was the first time
he indicated he was not happy.
沒錯
That's correct.
他用42天學習了我們的系統，并據為己有
He had 42 days to study our system
and get out ahead.
- 你在Facebook上看到任何一條你們的代碼嗎？
- 塞，拜托…
- Do you see any of your code on Facebook?
- Sy, could you...
有任何一條你們的代碼嗎？
Did I use any of your code?
你偷了我們整個創意
You stole our whole goddamn idea.
- 先生們
- 什么創意？哈佛男生拉皮條網站？
- Fellas.
- What? Match.com for Harvard guys?
我能繼續讀我的証詞嗎？
Can I continue with my deposition?
你們大可不必告來告去
You know, you really don't need
a forensics team to get to the bottom of this.
如果你們覺得自己發明了Facebook
If you guys were the inventors of Facebook,
那就算是你們發明的好了
you'd have invented Facebook.
我等不及看著你寫支票賠償我們了
I can't wait to stand over your shoulder
and watch you write us a check.
見鬼去吧
No shit.
繼續
Let's continue.
2004年2月4日
February 4, 2004.
馬克
Mark.
馬克
Mark.
你的美學史課上有個姑娘
叫斯蒂芬妮﹒阿提斯
There is a girl in your art history class.
Her name is Stephanie Attis.
她有沒有男朋友？
Do you happen to know
if she has a boyfriend?
你看到過她和別人在一起嗎？
Have you ever seen her with anyone?
或者，你知不知道她想約會誰
And, if not, do you happen to know
if she's looking to go out with anyone?
達斯汀
Dustin.
人們不會在臉上貼張紙
寫著我是不是有男朋友…
People don't walk around with
a sign on them that says...
馬克？
Mark?
說好9點見面的
We were supposed to meet at 9:00.
- 你多久沒睡覺了？
- 我必須加點東西
- Have you slept yet?
- I have to add something.
什么？
What?
天哪，做的真漂亮
Shit, that looks good.
That looks really good.
簡潔明了
It's clean and simple.
沒有雜七雜八的東西，看著吧
No Disneyland, no "live nude girls."
But watch.
你在寫什么？
What'd you write?
“戀愛狀況”，“興趣”
"Relationship Status." "Interested In."
大學生關心什么
他們就是關心你有沒有交往對象
This is what drives life at college.
"Are you having sex or aren't you?"
這決定他們上什么課，坐在誰旁邊
做些什么事情
It's why people take certain classes
and sit where they sit and do what they do.
以這個為中心，這就是Facebook的意義
And at its center, you know, that's
what The Facebook is gonna be about.
人們會不停登陸，發布自己的近況
People are gonna log on because
after all the cake and watermelon,
因為他們最終有機會…
there's a chance they're actually gonna...
- 和姑娘睡覺
- …和女孩約會，是的
- Gonna get laid
- ...meet a girl. Yes.
真不錯
That is really good.
完成了
And that was it.
- 什么意思？
- 網站准備就緒
- What do you mean?
- It's ready.
- 准備就緒？現在？
- 是的，完成了
- It's ready? Right now?
- Yeah. That was it.
現在寫關于我們
And here's the masthead.
- 你還寫了關于我們
- 是的
- You made a masthead.
- Yeah.
- 愛德華多﹒薩維林，合伙創始人兼首席財務官
- 是的
- "Eduardo Saverin, co-founder and CFO."
- Yeah.
你不知道我爸看到會多開心
You have no idea what
that's gonna mean to my father.
我知道
Sure I do.
什么時候上線？
So when's it going live?
立刻，打開你的電腦
Right now. Get your laptop out.
為什么是我的電腦？
What? Why do we need my laptop?
因為你有鳳凰社的郵件群發地址
Because you got e-mails
for everybody at the Phoenix.
給他們發垃圾郵件恐怕不太好吧
Yeah, I'm not sure if it's gonna be cool
with them that I spam their e-mails.
- 這不是垃圾郵件
- 我知道這不是
- This is not spam.
- No, I know it's not spam.
只發給我們的朋友
轉到死也轉不出什么名堂
If we send it to our friends,
it's just gonna bounce around Dworkin.
我還沒入社呢
I haven't gotten in yet.
鳳凰社的家伙人緣廣
我需要他們的郵箱地址
These guys know people.
And I need their e-mails.
- 好吧
- 很好
- Sure.
- Good.
把群發地址給我
Give me the mailing list.
Jabberwock12.listserv@harvard.edu
（Jabberwocky是Lewis Carroll在《愛麗絲漫游奇境記》的
續集《鏡中世界》中的一首仿古英語歪詩）
Jabberwock12.listserv@harvard.edu.
這群家伙
These guys.
他們太有文學天賦了
Yeah, they're literary geniuses
全世界最好的猥瑣流詩歌
就是劉易斯﹒卡羅爾的…
because the world's most obvious
Lewis Carroll reference is in...
- 他們沒那么壞
- 隨便說說
- They're not so bad.
- I'm just saying.
你是對的
Yeah, you're right.
網站誕生了
The site's live.
出去喝一杯慶祝一下吧
You know, let's go get a drink and celebrate.
我請客
I'm buying.
馬克
Mark.
馬克，你在祈禱嗎？
Mark, are you praying?
不是要唱科爾﹒波特和厄文﹒柏林的歌嗎？
Whatever happened to Cole Porter
and Irving Berlin?
這是情人節，所以要唱情歌
It's a Valentine's Day theme.
They're playing love songs.
說的好
Good point.
科爾﹒波特和厄文﹒柏林從沒寫過情歌
'Cause Cole Porter and Irving Berin
never wrote any love songs.
親愛的，把電腦收起來吧
Honey, you should put your laptop away.
7個不同的人發給我同一個鏈接
Seven different people
spammed me the same link.
- 中毒了吧
- 是什么？
- KC.
- What is it?
不知道
I don't know.
希望是那只長的像希特勒一樣的小貓照片
But I'm really hoping
it's Cats That Look Like Hitler,
它的照片我永遠看不夠
'cause I can never get enough of that.
不是的
No, it's not.
迪夫
Div!
怎么了？
What?
這是你的
This isn't mine.
出什么事了？
Okay, what is wrong?
沒事，沒事
It's fine. It's fine. It's fine.
嘿！
Hey!
嘿！
Hey!
現在不行！
Not now!
還要練20分鐘
We need 20 minutes!
好吧
Okay.
我只是想通知你們扎克伯格偷了我們的網站
I just wanted to let you know
that Zuckerberg stole our website.
馬克﹒扎克伯格
Mark Zuckerberg?
他偷了我們的網站
He stole our website.
36小時以前網站已經上線
It's been live for more than 36 hours.
霍奇基斯先生，泰勒，是爸爸的律師
Mr. Hotchkiss?
Ty, lawyer's on the phone with Dad.
是的，先生
我和我弟弟泰勒還有合伙人迪夫亞在一起
Yes, sir, I'm here with my brother Tyler
and our business partner Divya.
歡迎光臨Facebook
"Welcome to The Facebook.
Facebook是一個在線人名錄
"The Facebook is an online directory
that connects people
通過不同社交網絡連接每個人
"through different social networks.
必須使用哈佛內部地址才能注冊
"You must have a harvard.edu address
to register."
是的，我之前打過，我要找馬克﹒扎克伯格
Yeah, I called earier.
I'm looking for Mark Zuckerberg.
是的，先生，他引用了好几段
Yes, sir.
He's actually quoted a couple times.
我讀給你聽
I can read it to you.
大家談論了不少關于
建立哈佛全校同學錄的事，他這樣說
"'Everyone's been talking a lot about a
universal facebook within Harvard,' he says."
這個他指的是馬克
"He" meaning Mark.
我覺得我們有點傻，因為要學校做同學錄
"'I think it's kind of silly
that it would take the university
他們不知得磨蹭多少年才能稍微有點進展
"'a couple of years to get around to it.
我可以在一周內完成，并做的更好
"'I can do a classier job than they can
and I did it in a week."'
告訴他迪夫亞﹒倫德拉找他
Tell him Divya Narendra called.
- 我知道，他是這么說的
- 謝謝
- I know, that's how he talks.
- Appreciate it.
昨天晚上，扎克伯格說道
"As of yesterday evening, Zuckerberg said,
網站注冊數超過650人
"over 650 students had registered
to use thefacebook.com.
他說預計到今天早晨注冊學生將達到900人
"He said he anticipated that 900 students
would have joined the site by this morning."
是的，迪夫亞剛才讀到
第一天就有650人在網站上注冊
Yeah, Divya was just reading that 650
students signed up for it on the first day.
上帝，就算我是個毒販
我也不可能在一天內免費發毒品給650人
God, if I was a drug dealer I couldn't
give free drugs to 650 people in one day.
這家伙除了可憐兮兮的3個朋友
再多一個也交不到
And this guy doesn't have three friends
to rub together to make a fourth.
好的，我們知道怎么做，霍奇基斯先生
All right.
Yes, that's what we'll do, Mr. Hotchkiss.
我們會把這些打包發郵件給你
We'll put all this together
and we'll e-mail it to you.
你上不了這個網站
Well, you won't be able
to go on the website yourself.
因為你沒有哈佛內部地址…
Because you don't have a Harvard...
總之我們發郵件給你會更方便
You know what, it would just be easier
for us to e-mail it to you.
你說的很對
I'm sure you're right.
他人不錯也很聰明
我想他不是故意這樣做的…
He's a good guy and he's very bright
and I'm sure he didn't mean to do...
Wow.
...what he did.
好的，非常感謝你，還有，爸爸…
All right, thank you very much. And, Dad...
好的，我們也愛你
All right, love you, too.
- 他人不錯？
- 我們不了解他，他不一定是壞人
- This is a good guy?
- We don't know that he's not a good guy.
但他盜用了我們的創意
We know he stole our idea.
他騙了我們整整一個半月
We know he lied to our faces
for a month and a half.
- 他沒有當面撒謊騙我們
- 那是因為他根本不見我們
- No, he never lied to our faces.
- Okay, he never saw our faces.
好吧，他在郵件里撒謊
給自己爭取到了42天的時間
Fine, he lied to our e-mail accounts
and he gave himself a 42-day head start,
先下手為強
because he knows
what apparently you don't,
顯然他比你更懂得這一點
which is that getting there first
is everything.
我是競技運動員，迪夫
I'm a competitive racer, Div.
不需要你教我什么是先下手為強，謝謝
I don't think you need to school me in the
importance of getting there first. Thank you.
- 剛才是你父親的律師？
- 他是家庭法律顧問
- That was your father's lawyer?
- It was his in-house counsel.
他會看一下所有材料，如果他認為合適的話
He's gonna look at all this
and if he thinks it's appropriate
他會發一封制止令
he'll send a cease-and-desist letter.
那有什么用？
What's that gonna do?
怎么，你還想請律師告他侵權？
What, do you wanna hire an IP lawyer
and sue him?
不，我想請個女高音用麥克風砸死他
No, I wanna hire the Sopranos to beat
the shit out of him with a hammer.
- 沒必要這么做
- 是的
- We don't even have to do that.
- That's right.
我們自己動手好了，我1米98，200斤
這里有兩個一模一樣的我
We could do that ourselves.
I'm 6'5", 220, and there's two of me.
- 我支持你
- 隨便你們吧
- I'm with this guy.
- Well, whatever.
我說在事情查清楚之前，我們還是冷靜些吧
I'm saying, let's calm down
until we know what we're talking about.
還要查什么？
How much more information
are you waiting for?
我們和馬克見過三次面，交換了52封郵件
We met with Mark three times,
we exchanged 52 e-mails,
我們足以証明他看過代碼
we can prove that he looked at the code.
- 頁腳怎么寫的？
- 上面寫著馬克﹒扎克伯格出品
- What is that on the bottom of the page?
- It says "A Mark Zuckerberg production."
- 在首頁？
- 在每一頁
- On the home page?
- On every page.
見鬼，我要去透透氣
Shit, I need a second to let
the classiness waft over me.
好了，聽著，我們還不知道…
Okay, look, we don't know...
卡梅倫，這里寫道
扎克伯格說希望隱私選項
Cam, they wrote, "Zuckerberg said
he hoped the privacy options
可以讓大家對facemash的事既往不咎
"would help restore his reputation
從而恢復他的名譽
"following student outrage
over facemash.com."
我們當時就是這么和他說的
他在校報上赤裸裸的諷刺我們
That's exactly what we said to him.
He's giving us the finger in The Crimson.
在等爸爸的律師看材料的時候
While we're waiting for Dad's lawyer
to look this stuff over,
至少我們可以登報讓大家知道…
we can at least get something
going in the paper so people know...
- 知道什么？
- 知道這個網站存在爭議
- What?
- ...that this is in dispute.
別動不動就要動刀動槍
We're not starting a knife fight
in The Crimson.
我們也不會告任何人
And we're not suing anybody.
為什么不？
Why not?
我不懂，我不懂，為什么？
I don't understand, I don't understand.
Why not?
他會說這很愚蠢
He's gonna say it's stupid.
什么，誰，我？
What, who, me?
說啊，為什么？
Say it. Why not?
因為我們在哈佛有頭有臉
Because we're gentlemen of Harvard.
這是哈佛，不是你隨便亂說隨便告人的地方
This is Harvard, where you don't
plant stories and you don't sue people.
他不是唯一一個覺得你很愚蠢的人
You thought he was gonna be
the only one who thought that was stupid?
當你說你有個創意時
Durng the time when you say
you had this idea,
你是否知道泰勒和卡梅倫來自上流家庭
did you know Tyler and Cameron
came from a family of means?
上流家庭？
"A family of means"?
你是否知道他們的父親很有錢？
Did you know their father was wealthy?
你不懂你這么問的意思
I'm not sure why you're asking me that.
你不懂無所謂
It's not important you be sure
why I'm asking.
- 這對你也無所謂
- 塞
- It's not important to you.
- Sy.
你是否知道他們很有錢？
Did you know that they came from money?
我不知道他們是不是有錢
I had no idea whether
they came from money or not.
這是你發給倫德納先生的一封信
In one of your e-mails to Mr Narendra,
你提到過霍華德﹒文克萊沃斯的咨詢公司
you referenced Howard Winklevoss'
consulting firm.
隨你怎么說
If you say so.
霍華德﹒文克萊沃斯擁有一家公司
資產上億
Howard Winklevoss founded a firm whose
assets are in the hundreds of millions.
同時你也知道
泰勒和卡梅倫是期末俱樂部的會員
You also knew Tyler and Cameron
were members
這個俱樂部叫做坡斯廉
of a Harvard final club called the Porcellian.
他們自己說的
They pointed that out.
- 抱歉真不該帶你去坡斯廉
- 是門廊吧
- Excuse us for inviting you in.
- To the bike room.
這樣我們可以說你知道我的委托人很富有
Please. So it's safe to say you were aware
that my clients had money.
是的
Yes.
告訴你我為什么這么問
Let me tell you why I'm asking.
我覺得奇怪，你需要1000美元啟動資金
I'm wondering why, if you needed $1,000
for an Internet venture,
為什么不向我的委托人索要
you didn't ask my clients for it.
他們向你表露過可以提供資金
They had demonstrated an interest to you
in that kind of thing.
我去找我的朋友要錢是因為我只想和他合作
I went to my friend for the money because
that's who I wanted to be partners with.
愛德華多是哈佛投資協會的主席
Eduardo was the president of
the Harvard Investors Association,
也是我最好的朋友
and he was also my best friend.
你最好的朋友告你賠償600萬美元
Your best friend is suing you
for $600 million.
我不清楚這個，要不你給我說說
I didn't know that. Tell me more.
愛德華多，網站上線以后發生了什么？
Eduardo, what happened
afterthe initial launch?
抱歉，塞，請稱呼他薩維林先生
I'm sorry, Sy, would you mind
addressing him as Mr. Saverin?
- 格雷琴，他們是最好的朋友
- 不再是了
- Gretchen, they're best friends.
- Not anymore.
這個我們已經討論過了，算了
Well, we already went through this on the...
Never mind.
薩維林先生，網站上線以后發生了什么？
Mr. Saverin, what happened
after the initial launch?
大受歡迎
It exploded.
每個學生都去注冊了
Everybody on campus was using it.
二周后，加我臉譜成了最流行的話
"Facebook me" was a common expression
after two weeks.
馬克呢？
And Mark?
馬克成了校園的大人物
簡直超過了19個諾貝爾獎得主
And Mark was the biggest thing on
a campus that included 19 Nobel laureates,
15個普利策獎得主
2個未來的奧運會冠軍，還有一個影星
15 Pulitzer Prize winners,
two future Olympians, and a movie star.
哪個影星？
Who was the movie star?
有關系嗎？
Does it matter?
沒有
No.
…在城外消息，他拿了一本大眾電子雜志
...at Out of Town News and picked up
that copy of Popular Electronics magazine
封面上印著MITS Altair kit（個人電腦始祖）
with the MITS Altair kit on the cover.
那天天氣很好，我正在拉德克利夫宿舍里
It was a beautiful day
and I was in my Radcliffe dorm room.
他拿著這本雜志過來給我看，他說
He brought that magazine up
and he showed it to me and he said,
看哪，你再不動手就來不及了，必須開始了
"Look, it's gonna happen without us.
We've gotta start now."
我說好吧，我們先把BASIC語言寫進去
And I said, "Okay
Let's get BASIC out there."
剩下的故事你們大概都知道了
但你們只知其一
Now, most of you think you know
the rest of the story, but you may not.
這個產業初始相當不完善
The beginnings of this industry
were very humble.
雜志封面上的這台個人電腦
用的是8080處理器
That kit computer on the cover of
that magazine had an 8080 processor in it.
只有256字節內存
除非花錢再買個1K的內存條
Unless you paid extra for
a 1K memory board, you got 256 bytes.
所以最大的挑戰是
我不僅要用4KB運行BASIC
So the challenge when I wrote BASIC
wasnt just to run at 4 k-bytes,
還要留出4KB給用戶運行他們的程序
but I also had to leave room for the users
to run their programs in 4 k-bytes.
你朋友，是馬克﹒扎克伯格？
Your friend. Is that Mark Zuckerberg?
是的
Yeah.
- 他創造了Facebook？
- 是的
- He made The Facebook.
- Yeah.
我是說，我和他一起創造的…
I mean, it's both of ours. We're...
對，是我們…是的
Yeah, we... Yes.
了不起
Cool.
我叫克里斯蒂﹒李，這是愛麗絲
I'm Christy Ling. This is Alice.
嗨
Hi.
很高興認識你們
Well, very nice to meet you.
回去以后加我臉譜
Facebook me when you get home.
找機會一起喝一杯
You know, maybe we can all go out
and grab a drink.
當然可以
Certainly.
我肯定會的
Absolutely do that.
她說，加我臉譜，找機會出去喝一杯
She said, "Facebook me
and we can all go for a drink later,"
沖這兩點我就要樂瘋了
which is stunningly great for two reasons.
首先她說了加我臉譜，對嗎？
其次，你知道嗎…
One, she said "facebook me," right?
And then the other is, well, you know...
她們想約我們喝酒
They wanna have drinks later.
沒錯，你有聽過這么短的句子里
Yes, have you ever heard
so many different good things
同時包含了那么多好事嗎？
packed into one regular-sized sentence?
抱歉，你是馬克？
Excuse me, Mark?
什么事？
Yeah?
我叫斯圖亞特﹒辛格
我和你一起上操作系統課
I'm Stuart Singer. I'm in your OS lab.
是的
Sure.
- Facebook真的不錯
- 干得漂亮
- Awesome job with The Facebook.
- Awesome job.
謝謝
Thanks.
- 我叫鮑勃
- 你好嗎？
- I'm Bob.
- How you doing?
知道嗎，當他說我相信
下一個比爾蓋茨就在這個教室里
You know, I could swear
he was looking at you
when he said the next Bill Gates
could be right in this room.
我發誓他正看著你呢
不可能吧
I doubt it.
我遲到了一會兒，都不知道是誰在演講
And I showed up late.
I don't even know who the speaker was.
是比爾蓋茨
It was Bill Gates.
見鬼，有道理啊
Shit, that makes sense.
好的，謝謝了，伙計們
All right. Thanks, guys.
- 你是傻子嗎？
- 你腦子是不是有病？
- Are you a moron?
- Are you medically stupid?
看了一個小時你都沒認出比爾蓋茨？
You can't tell Bill Gates
is in front of you for an hour?
我沒帶隱形眼鏡
I wasn't wearing my contacts.
殺了你的心都有
Can I get a Glock and kill you?
可以開始賺錢了
It's time to monetize the thing.
她們叫什么？
What were their names?
- 聽到我剛才說的嗎？
- 什么時候？
- Hear what I just said?
- When?
網站可以開始賺錢了
I said it's time to monetize the site.
什么意思？
What does that mean?
是時候可以開始賺錢了
It means it's time for the website
to start generating revenue.
我知道賺錢的意思，我是問你打算怎么做
No, I know what the word means.
I'm asking how you wanna do it.
- 廣告
- 不行
- Advertising.
- No.
我們現在有4000個會員了
Well, we got 4,000 members.
因為Facebook很酷
'Cause The Facebook is cool,
如果突然跳出一個激浪廣告，那就不酷了
and if we start installing pop-ups
for Mountain Dew, it's not gonna be cool.
你可以不做激浪廣告啊
Well, I wasn't thinking Mountain Dew,
but at some point,
我只是在考慮公司和網站的商業前景…
and I'm talking as the business end
of the company, the site...
我們甚至不了解這個網站
We don't even know what it is yet.
We don't know what it is.
我們不知道它會有什么發展
也不知道它會如何發展
We don't know what it can be.
We don't know what it will be.
我們只知道它很酷
We know that it is cool.
他是無價之寶，我不會放棄的
That is a priceless asset I'm not giving up.
- 什么時候才能有個頭
- 不會有頭的
- So when will it be finished?
- It won't be finished.
是的，就像時尚，永遠不會消亡
That's the point.
The way fashion's never finished.
- 什么？
- 時尚，時尚是沒有終點的
- What?
- Fashion. Fashion is never finished.
你几時也開始談論時尚了？
You're talking about fashion? Really, you?
我指的是創意，創意沒有終點
I'm talking about the idea of it
and I'm saying that it's never finished.
好吧，就算時尚界也要賣褲子賺錢吧
Okay. But they manage
to make money selling pants.
馬克，這是什么？
Mark, what is this?
- 什么？
- 這個
- What?
- This.
那叫制止令，她們叫什么名字？
It's called a cease-and-desist letter.
What were their names?
- 誰？
- 姑娘們
- Who?
- The girls.
你什么時候收到的？
When did you get this?
大約10天前，網站剛上線的時候
About 10 days ago.
Right after we launched the site.
- 上帝啊
- 快說她們叫什么名字
- Jesus Christ.
- Hey, the girls. What were their names?
文氏兄弟說你盜用了他們的創意
The Winklevoss twins are saying
that you stole their idea.
我覺得他們真夠煩人的
I find that to be a little more
than mildly annoying.
他們覺得這是侵犯知識產權
Oh, well, they find it to be
intellectual property theft.
- 聽著…
- 你怎么不給我看？
- Look...
- Why didn't you show this to me?
信是寫給我的
It was addressed to me.
上面說我們從迪夫亞﹒倫德拉
和文氏兄弟那里，盜用了Facebook
They're saying that we stole The Facebook
from Divya Narendra and the Winklevosses.
- 我都看過了
- 我們有嗎？
- I know what it says.
- Did we?
有什么？
Did we what?
別糊弄我了，看著我
Don't screw around with me now.
Look at me.
信上說我們可能面臨起訴
The letter says we could face legal action.
不對，是我可能面臨起訴
No, it says I could face legal action.
這是對方律師寄來的，馬克
肯定不是空穴來風
This is from a lawyer, Mark.
They must feel they have some grounds.
- 是他們父親的家庭顧問而已
- 他們有証據嗎？
- The lawyer is their father's house counsel.
- Do they have grounds?
証據就是我們的網站大受歡迎
The grounds are
our thing is cool and popular,
而他們的哈佛連線卻一無是處
and Harvard Connection is lame.
華多，我沒有用他們的代碼
一個都沒有，我保証
Wardo, I didn't use any of their code,
I promise.
都是我自己寫的
I didn't use anything.
聽著，我發明了一張漂亮的凳子
Look, a guy who builds a nice chair
doesn't owe money
我不可能把賺的錢
分給所有做凳子的人是吧？
to everyone who ever
has built a chair, okay?
他們找我談了他們的創意
但我自己有更好的
They came to me with an idea,
I had a better one.
- 律師信的事為什么瞞著我？
- 我不覺得這算什么大事
- Why didn't you show me this letter?
- I didn't think it was a big deal.
好吧
Okay.
如果有事，不管什么事，你都要告訴我
So if there's something wrong, if there's
ever anything wrong, you can tell me.
我會幫你的，這不是你一個人的事
I'm the guy that wants to help.
This is our thing.
那么，還有什么要告訴我的嗎？
Now, is there anything
that you need to tell me?
沒有
No.
那我們怎么辦？
What are we doing about this?
我咨詢了學生律師服務處
他們叫我寫封回信
I went to a 3L at Student Legal Services
and he told me to write them back.
你怎么寫的？
And what did you say?
一月份開會時，我就提出過疑問
"When we met in January,
I expressed my doubts about the site.
網站界面以圖片為主，導致編程量劇增
"Where it stood with graphics,
how much programing was left
這是我沒有料到的
"that I had not anticipated."
硬件不足也是一個問題
"The lack of hardware
we had to deal with site use,
網站上線后也缺乏好的增長點
"the lack of promotion that would go on
to successfully launch the website."
這是你第一次提出疑問嗎？
This was the first time you raised
any of those concerns, right?
我早就提出過了
I'd raised concerns before.
- 放屁
- 你沒和我們說過
- Bullshit.
- Not to us.
先生們，我說的是
這封信上提到的一月份的會議
Gentlemen, I'm talking about at the meeting
in January to which this letter is referring.
是的
Yeah.
我來概括一下
Let me rephrase this.
你給我的委托人發過16封郵件
前15封中你從來沒有表示過任何不滿意
You sent my client 16 e-mails.
In the first 15 you didn't raise any concerns.
這算是問題嗎？
Is that a question?
在第16封中你提出了網站功能性不足的問題
In the 16th e-mail you raised concerns
about the site's functionality.
- 你是不是故意拖延了6周的時間？
- 不是
- Were you leading them on for six weeks?
- No.
那么之前你為何對這些問題只字不提？
Then why didn't you raise
any of these concerns before?
- 下雨了？
- 你說什么？
- It's raining.
- I'm sorry?
開始下雨了
It just started raining.
扎克伯格先生，你有集中注意力嗎？
Mr. Zuckerberg,
do I have your full attention?
沒有
No.
我有資格嗎？
Do you think I deserve it?
什么？
What?
你覺得我有資格讓你集中注意力嗎？
Do you think I deserve your full attention?
聽証開始前我宣誓過說真話
I had to swear an oath
before we began this deposition
我不想做假証，所以我有權利說沒有
and I don't wanna perjure myself,
so I have a legal obligation to say no.
好吧，沒有
你覺得我不配擁有你全部的注意力是吧？
Okay. No.
You don't think I deserve your attention?
我認為如果你的委托人
愿意騎到我頭上大耍威風
I think if your clients wanna sit on
my shoulders and call themselves tall,
他們可以盡管一試
they have a right to give it a try,
但也沒人要求我興高采烈的坐在這里
聽你們撒謊
but there's no requirement that I enjoy
sitting here listening to people lie.
你擁有我的部分注意力，最小的那部分
You have part of my attention.
You have the minimum amount.
我剩下的注意力都集中在辦公室
The rest of my attention is
back at the offices of Facebook,
我和同事們正在做的事情
在座的沒有一位有能力做到
where my colleagues and I are doing things
that no one in this room,
尤其包括你的委托人
including and especially your clients,
他們沒有這個腦筋和這份創造力
are intellectually or creatively
capable of doing.
您老對我的回答滿意了嗎？
Did I adequately answer
your condescending question?
12點45分了，我建議先吃午餐
Well, I have 12:45.
Why don't we say that's lunch?
2點半回到這里
Back at 2:30.
她們叫什么？
So what were their names?
克莉斯汀，愛麗絲
Their names were Christy and Alice,
她們約我們今晚去酒吧
and they wanna have drinks tonight.
在這里不好吧，這里是男廁所
You're not supposed to be in here.
This is a men's room.
Wow.
上帝啊
Oh, my God.
我不在乎
I don't care.
抱歉，老兄
Hey, man, sorry.
姑娘們在里面梳洗
A couple girls are freshening up in there.
不錯啊
Sweet.
我們有骨肉皮了
（骨肉皮是一群追求和明星發生關系的人）
We have groupies.
我就回來
I'll be right back.
馬克，你去哪兒？馬克
Mark, where you going? Mark.
艾瑞卡？
Erica?
嗨
Hi.
我在那兒看見你，我不知道你常來這個酒吧
I saw you from over there.
I didn't know you came to this club a lot.
- 我第一次來
- 我也是
- First time.
- Mine, too.
我能和你單獨談一會兒嗎？
Could I talk to you alone for a second?
有事就在這兒說吧
I think I'm good right here.
我只是…我想單獨和你說話
我們找個地方好嗎
I just... I'd love to talk to you alone
if we could just go someplace.
就在這兒說吧
Right here is fine.
不知道你有沒有聽說，我的新網站上線了
I don't know if you heard about
this new website I launched.
沒有
No.
- Facebook？
- 你在網上罵我是賤人，馬克
- The Facebook?
- You called me a bitch on the Internet, Mark.
我就是來和你解釋的
That's why I wanted to talk to you.
- 在網上
- 我想和你談談這事
- On the Internet.
- That's why I came over.
比較女人和牲口
Comparing women to farm animals.
后來我沒有這么做
I didn't end up doing that.
但你寫出來了
It didn't stop you from writing it.
就好象你腦袋瓜有多么聰明絕頂
As if every thought that tumbles
through your head was so clever
不把里面的東西寫出來就好象犯罪了一樣
it would be a crime for it not to be shared.
在網上寫過的東西是永遠擦不掉的，馬克
The Internet's not written in pencil, Mark,
it's written in ink,
你不僅說我是個賤人
and you published that Erica Albright
was a bitch,
侮辱了我的家族姓氏
還對我的胸部評頭論足
right before you made some ignorant crack
about my family's name, my bra size,
還搞什么辣妹評選？
and then rated women
based on their hotness.
- 艾瑞卡，需要幫忙嗎？
- 沒關系的
- Erica, is there a problem?
- No, there's no problem.
你就關在黑屋里亂噴這個世界去吧
You write your snide bullshit
from a dark room
現在的憤青都在這么做
because that's what the angry do nowadays.
我對你很客氣了，別再煩我了
I was nice to you. Don't torture me for it.
我們找個地方好好談談行嗎…
If we could just go somewhere for a minute...
我這里還有朋友
I don't wanna be rude to my friends.
好吧
Okay.
祝你那個什么網絡游戲成功
Good luck with your video game.
嘿，太棒了，這么做就對了
Hey, that was great.
That was the right thing to do.
你向她道歉了是嗎？
You apologized, right?
我們要擴張
We have to expand.
好的，馬克？
Sure. Mark?
他吃錯藥了？
Is he mad about something?
我們要將網站規模擴大到耶魯和哥倫比亞
Okay, we are expanding
to Yale and Columbia.
達斯汀，你和我一起負責編碼工作
Dustin, I want you to share
the coding work with me.
克里斯，你負責宣傳和外聯
Chris, you're gonna be in charge
of publicity and outreach,
你先寫篇文章登到波士頓學生報上去
and you could start by getting a story
in the BU student newspaper.
那報紙叫學生之橋
It's The Bridge.
他們討厭登哈佛的文章
They hate doing stories about Harvard.
那報社里肯定有主修計算機的
Somebody at the newspaper
will be a computer science major.
告訴他們馬克﹒扎克伯格
可以免費給他們做10小時編程
Tell them that Mark Zuckerberg
will do 10 hours of free programing.
干嘛要在波士頓的報紙上登？
Why do you want a story
in the BU newspaper?
我就是要，我來安排每個人的任務
Because I do. Now here's the arrangement.
愛德華多是首席財務官，擁有公司30%股份
Eduardo is CFO
and owns 30% of the company.
達斯汀是副主席主要負責編程
Dustin is vice president
and head of programing,
從我的那部分里划5%股份給他
and his 5% of the company
wil come from my end.
克里斯負責公關
Chris is director of publicity,
根據業績提成
and his compensation will depend on
how much work he ends up doing.
有問題嗎？
Any questions?
- 哪來的姑娘？
- 這是克莉斯汀，還有愛麗絲
- Who are the girls?
- Sorry. They're Christy and Alice.
- 你好
- 你好
- Hi.
- Hi.
- 你好
- 嗨
- Hello.
- Hi.
需要我們幫忙嗎？
Is there anything we can do?
不用了
No, that's it.
- 耶魯，哥倫比亞，行動吧
- 還有斯坦福
- Yale and Columbia, let's go.
- And Stanford.
- 什么？
- 斯坦福
- What?
- Stanford.
是時候讓他們看看了
It's time for them to see this in Palo Alto.
你不吃午飯嗎？
You don't want any lunch?
不吃
No.
來點色拉吧
You're welcome to some salad.
不了，謝謝
No, thank you.
你肯定不好受吧
This must be hard.
你是誰？
Who are you?
我叫瑪麗蓮﹒德爾比
上次見面時我介紹過自己
I'm Marylin Delpy.
I introduced myself when we first...
我的意思是，你是做什么的？
I mean, what do you do?
我在公司做了兩年助理
I'm a second-year associate at the firm.
老板讓我來參與聽証
My boss wanted me to sit in
on the deposition phase.
你在干嘛？
What are you doing?
看看波斯尼亞（南斯拉夫中部）的新聞
Checking in to see how it's going in Bosnia.
波斯尼亞
Bosnia.
那兒連路都不通卻能上Facebook
They don't have roads,
but they have Facebook.
你一定恨死文氏兄弟了
You must really hate the Winklevosses.
我誰都不恨
I don't hate anybody.
文氏兄弟告我，不是因為我侵犯知識產權
The Winklevi aren't suing me
for intellectual property theft.
他們生來要風得風要雨得雨
They are suing me because
for the first time in their lives,
但這一次不一樣了，這就是他們告我的原因
things didn't work out the way
they were supposed to for them.
他在擴張
He's expanding.
什么？
What?
他在往耶魯，哥倫比亞和斯坦福擴張
He's expanding
to Yale, Columbia and Stanford.
校報明天就會刊登
It's gonna be in The Crimson tomorrow.
- 真的？
- 對
- Really?
- Yep.
你的制止令還真他媽有用啊？
Well, looks like that cease-and-desist letter
realy scared the shit out of him, huh?
我要請律師告他，我要網站立刻下線
I wanna hire a lawyer to file for injunctive
relief and get the site taken down now.
他的網站每存在一分鐘
哈佛連線就失去一份價值
Every minute the site is up,
Harvard Connection becomes less valuable.
我要阻止他，要他賠錢，要他坐牢
I want an injunction. I want damages.
I want punitive relief.
我要他死
And I want him dead.
我也這么希望
Yeah, I want those things, too.
那為什么還不行動？
Then why aren't we doing anything about it?
就因為我們在哈佛有頭有臉？
Because we're gentlemen of Harvard?
你也不想想這樣有多難看
No, it's because you're not thinking
how it's gonna look.
怎么難看了？
How's it gonna look?
好比我和我弟弟穿著骷髏戲服
Like my brother and I
are in skeleton costumes
在高中體育場里追一個功夫小子
chasing the Karate Kid
around a high school gym.
卡梅倫，他違反了馬塞諸塞州立法
Cam, he's violated Massachusetts state law.
如果他在康涅狄格州
紐約州或是加利福尼亞
When he goes to Connecticut,
New York and California,
他就違反了聯邦法
he'll have violated federal law.
再說，他也違反了哈佛的法規
And, by the way,
he's in violation of Harvard law.
哈佛沒有什么法規
There's no such thing as Harvard law.
等等，有了
Wait. Yeah, there is.
哈佛學生行為手冊
Harvard Student Handbook.
每個新生都會拿到一本手冊
上面有這樣一條…
Every freshman is issued one of these,
and somewhere in this book it says...
學生之間不可偷竊
You can't steal from another student.
這正是我們需要的，該去見見薩默斯了
This is what we needed.
We're going to Summers.
你不可能見到拉瑞﹒薩默斯
Well, you can't get a meeting
with Larry Summers.
我們來這所學校是交了學費的
My brother and I,
we pay tuition at this school.
我們學習成績優異，幫學校贏了那么多獎杯
We carry a 3.9 GPA at this school.
We've won trophies for this school.
我們還會代表哈佛參加奧運會
And we'll be rowing in the Olympics
for this school.
我要和這位校長好好談談
I want a meeting with
the goddamn president of this school.
為什么有斯坦福？
Why Stanford?
你說為什么呢？
Why do you think?
抱歉
I'm sorry.
生化課要遲到了
I'm late for biochem.
好吧
Okay.
你還不知道我名字吧？
You don't know my name, do you?
是不是斯坦福？
Is it Stanford?
去你的
I should just kick your ass.
你怎么這么隨隨便便就…
How do you go to a party
and you meet someone...
阿米莉亞﹒利塔，你喜歡別人叫你艾米
你來自奧林達
Amelia Ritter, but you prefer Amy.
You're from Orinda.
你父親是地產商，母親戒酒10年
Your father's in commercial real estate
and your mother's 10 years sober.
我主修什么？
What's my major?
- 吹長號
- 是嗎？
- Trombone.
- Really?
我記得和長號有關
I remember something about a trombone.
法語
French.
你主修法語
Your major's French.
- 你呢？
- 我？
- And yours?
- Mine?
- 我沒有
- 你還沒申請主修課程？
- I don't have one
- You haven't declared?
我不上學
I don't go to school.
- 開玩笑
- 真的
- You're kidding.
- No.
那么你是哪個學校畢業的？
Well, where did you go to school?
在威廉﹒塔夫脫中學讀過一陣子
William Taft Elementary, for a little while.
認真點
Seriously?
你不會只有15歲吧，看著也不像
You're not like 15 years old or anything,
are you?
不是
No.
你也不像15歲，不是嗎？
Wait, you're not like 15, are you?
不是
No.
那你是做什么的？
So, what do you do?
我自己當老板
I'm an entrepreneur.
- 你失業了？
- 我沒那么說
- You're unemployed.
- I wouldn't say that.
你說你做什么的？
What would you say?
我自己當老板
That I'm an entrepreneur.
那么你最近在做什么生意？
Well, then, what was your latest preneur?
我辦了家網絡公司
提供免費音樂下載和共享
Well, I founded an Internet company that
let folks download and share music for free.
就像Napster一樣？
Kind of like Napster?
完全就是Napster
Exactly like Napster.
什么意思？
What do you mean?
我創辦了Napster
I founded Napster.
Napster的創始人是肖恩﹒帕克
Sean Parker founded Napster.
很高興認識你
Nice to meet you.
你是肖恩﹒帕克？
You're Sean Parker?
你看，鞋子，在另一個…
You see, the shoe's on the other...
- 腳？
- 桌子下面，翻過來了
- Foot?
- Table, which has turned.
我和肖恩﹒帕克上床了？
I just slept with Sean Parker?
你把肖恩﹒帕克壓在了下面
You just slept on Sean Parker.
- 你是個億萬富翁
- 嚴格來說不是
- You're a zillionaire.
- Not technically.
為什么？
What are you?
破產了，做免費音樂賺不了多少錢
Broke. There's not
a lot of money in free music,
一旦所有歌星都來起訴你侵權
境況就更慘了
even less when you're being sued by
everyone who's ever been to the Grammys.
你讓我大吃一驚
This is blowing my mind.
謝謝
I appreciate that.
我得去沖把澡，上課來不及了
I gotta hop in the shower
and get ready for class.
一個叫艾米的法語學女生竟然還要上生化課
Biochem, even though you're
a French major whose name is Amy.
算你過關
You passed.
我學習很用功的
I'm a hard worker.
那兒有果汁，你愛喝什么就倒什么
There's juice or anything else you can find.
Help yourself.
不介意我用電腦收下郵件吧？
You mind if I check my e-mail?
用吧
Yeah, go ahead.
艾米！
Amy!
老天爺
Jesus.
- 艾米！出來一下好嗎？
- 干嘛？
- Amy! Can you come out here?
- Yeah?
等一會兒
Just a second.
這兒有條蛇，艾米
There's a snake in here, Amy.
什么？
What?
哪兒？
Where?
沒蛇，我只是有事問你
There isn't a snake,
but I need to ask you something.
開什么玩笑？你差點害死我
Are you kidding me? I could've been killed.
為什么？
How?
跑太快可能被浴帘勒死
By running too fast
and getting twisted in the curtain.
你要問我什么？
What do you need to ask me?
我要去收電子郵件時發現
你計算機上開著一個網站
Yeah, I went to check my e-mail and
there's a website open on your computer.
昨晚在你睡著后，我去Facebook看了一會
Yeah, after you passed out last night
I went on The Facebook for a little bit.
- 那是什么？
- 是Facebook？
- What's that?
- The Facebook?
斯坦福大學差不多開通兩個星期了
Stanford's had it for, like, two weeks now.
那真的很棒，除了它極易上癮
It's really awesome,
except it's freakishly addictive.
說真的，那個網站我每天上五次
Seriously, I'm on the thing
like five times a day.
介意不介意在上面給我發送一個邀請？
Mind if I send myself an e-mail?
你還好吧？
Yeah, is everything okay?
好極了
Everything's great.
馬克﹒扎克伯格，我要找到你
I just need to find you, Mark Zuckerberg.
我從沒來過這個大樓
I've never been in this building before.
這個建筑比美國還要老100歲
所以要小心點
This building's 100 years older
than the country it's in, so do be careful.
我們只是坐在椅子上
We're sitting in chairs.
是的
Yes.
非常好，你們可以進去了
Very good. You can go in now.
那是他們自己的愚蠢，我去過那里
That's their own stupidity.
I should've been there.
黑暗是因為光明不在
Well, darkness is the absence of light,
那種情況下，愚蠢是因為我不在
and the stupidity in that instance
was the absence of me.
凱瑟琳，有學生到我辦公室了
Catherine I've got students
in my office now.
學生，本科生
Students. Undergrads.
我不知道
I don't know.
從表情看，他們想要賣給我
布魯克斯兄弟的專營權
From the looks of it, they want
to sell me a Brooks Brothers franchise.
好吧，再見
All right, bye-bye.
- 早上好
- 早上好，先生
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.
我是卡梅倫﹒文克萊沃斯
這是我的弟弟，泰勒
I'm Cameron Winklevoss
and this is my brother, Tyler.
那么你們來這是因為…
And you're here because...
你們兩個的一個可以回答
Either of you can answer.
抱歉，先生，我們以為你在讀信
I'm sorry, sir,
I thought you were reading the letter.
信我已經看完了
I've read the letter.
我們來這是因為一個叫哈佛連線的網站
Well, we came up wth an idea for
a website called Harvard Connection...
我們后來更名為ConnectU
但是馬克﹒扎克伯格剽竊了這個想法
We've since changed the name to ConnectU.
And Mark Zuckerberg stole that idea...
我明白了
I understand.
那么我想說的是你們想讓我做什么？
And I'm asking what you want me
to do about it.
校長先生，分發給每個新生的
哈佛大學學生手冊
Well, sir, in the Harvard Student Handbook,
which is distributed to each freshman,
“哈佛大學行為准則”
under the heading "Standards of Conduct
in the Harvard Community,"
它說，學院期望所有學生在這個團體里
it says the college expects all students
to be honest and forthcoming
和同學們相處時要以誠相待
in their dealings with members
in this community.
學生必須尊重公有制和私有制
Students are required to respect
public and private ownership,
有盜竊，濫用或者
and instances of theft, misappropriation or...
- 安妮？
- 先生，有什么事？
- Anne?
- Yes, sir?
給我來一拳，繼續
Punch me in the face. Go ahead.
或未經授權使用的行為將受到紀律處分
...or unauthorized use
will result in disciplinary action,
包括勒令退學
including the requirement
to withdraw from the college.
嘗試過采用另一種方式處理這件事嗎？
And you memorized that
instead of doing what?
這就是我和弟弟今天來到這里
打擾你的原因，當然…
What my brother and I came here today
to ask of you, respectfully, of course...
校長先生，很明顯盜竊違反了校規
Sir, it's against university rules to steal
from another student, plain and simple.
你和你的宿舍管理員說了這件事嗎？
And you've spoken to your House Master?
是的，校長，宿舍管理員提交到校委會
Yes, sir. And the House Master made
a recommendation to the Ad Board,
但是校委會沒有理會我們
but the Ad Board won't see us.
你有嘗試過和那位學生直接交涉嗎？
Have you tried dealing with
the other student directly?
扎克伯格先生在最近兩周內
Mr. Zuckerberg hasn't been responding
to any of our e-mails or phone calls
尚未對我們的電子郵件或電話作出回應
for the last two weeks.
我們在柯克蘭敲他的門，他也不回應
He doesn't answer when
we knock on his door at Kirkland,
最近一次和當面他交涉是
and the closest I've come
to dealing with him face-to-face
我看到他在校園里，穿過哈佛廣場去追他
is when I saw him on the quad
and chased him through Harvard Square.
你追他？
You chased him?
我看見他，我知道他看見我了
我尾隨其后但他卻消失不見了
I saw him and I know he saw me.
I went after him and then he disappeared.
- 我沒有把這看作是一個學校的問題
- 當然，這是一個學校的問題
- I don't see this as a university issue.
- Of course this is a university issue.
有一個道德准則和榮譽守則
他違反了他們倆
There's a code of ethics and an honor code
and he violated them both.
你是和大學一同進入道德標准，不是和對方
You enter into a code of ethics with
the university, not with each other.
我很遺憾，薩默斯校長
你剛才說的對我沒有任何意義
I'm sorry, President Summers, but what
you just said makes no sense to me at all.
那樣的話我很傷心
I'm devastated by that.
我弟弟的意思是
如果馬克﹒扎克伯格走進我們的宿舍
What my brother means is, if
Mark Zuckerberg walked into our dorm room
并偷走了我們的電腦，那將是學校的問題
and stole our computer,
that would be a university issue.
我真的不知道
我們辦公室不會處理輕盜竊罪
I really don't know.
This office doesn't handle petty larceny.
這個不是輕盜竊罪
This isnt petty larceny.
這個想法潛在價值值數百萬美元
This idea is potentially worth
millions of dollars.
- 几百萬？
- 是的
- Millions?
- Yes.
你還在真能想出來
You might just be letting
your imaginations run away with you.
先生，我不認為你有資格這么說
Sir, I honestly don't think you're
in any position to make that call.
我曾是美國財政部長
我還是有資格這么說的
I was the US Treasury Secretary.
I'm in some position to make that call.
放飛我們的想象力 
Letting our imaginations run away with us
正是你在新生入學演講上，對我們說的話
is exactly what we were told to do
in your freshman address.
好吧，那我建議你們把你們的精力
Well, then I would suggest
that you let your imaginations
放到新的項目上
run away with you on a new project.
你建議？
You would?
是的，哈佛大學的每個人都在發明東西
Yes. Everyone at Harvard's
inventing something.
哈佛學生的信條是，創業勝過打工
Harvard undergraduates believe that
inventing a job is better than finding a job.
所以，我再次建議你們去想一個新的項目
So I'll suggest again that the two of you
come up with a new new project.
- 對不起，先生，這不是重點
- 請說出重點
- I'm sorry, sir, but that's not the point.
- Please, arrive at the point.
你肯定不是知識產權方面的專家
You don't have to be
an intellectual property expert
不了解正確與錯誤的之間差異
to understand the difference
between right and wrong.
你說我不是？
And you're saying that I don't?
- 當然我不是那個意思，先生
- 我說你不是
- Of course I'm not saying that, sir.
- I'm saying that.
- 真的嗎？
- 先生
- Really?
- Sir.
安妮，他們怎么得到這個會面的？
Anne, how did they get this appointment?
是因為他們父親的同事
Colleagues of their father.
文克萊沃斯先生，讓我告訴你們
Let me tell you something,
Mr Winklevoss, Mr. Winklevoss,
既然你們要糾纏對錯的問題
since you're on the subject
of right and wrong.
這次會面，你們倆在這就是錯誤的
This action, this meeting,
the two of you being here is wrong.
你們不配呆在哈佛，哈佛也不歡迎你們
It's not worthy of Harvard.
It's not what Harvard saw in you.
你們不會得到特殊待遇
You don't get special treatment.
- 我們從來沒要求…
- 開始另一個項目？
- We never asked...
- Just start another project?
就像我們為科學展覽做的透視畫？
Like we're making a diorama
for a science fair?
文克萊沃斯先生，如果你們有什么問題…
If you have a problem
with that, Mr. Winklevoss...
我們從來沒要求什么特殊待遇
We never asked for special treatment.
你們可以上法院解決
還有什么我能為你們做的嗎？
...the courts are always at your disposal.
Is there anything else I can do for you?
你可以拿著哈佛學生手冊把它扔到…
You can take the Harvard
Student Handbook and shove it...
泰勒
Ty.
先生，非常感謝您能抽出時間
Thank you very much for your time, sir.
糟糕
Whoops.
弄壞了你335歲的門把手
Broke your 335-year-old doorknob.
愛德華多，春假期間
你和扎克伯格先生去了紐約
Eduardo, spring break, you
and Mr. Zuckerberg took a trip to New York.
- 是的
- 此行的目的是什么？
- Yes.
- What was the purpose of the trip?
作為首席財務官，我要和潛在的廣告商會面
Well, as CFO, I had set up some meetings
with potential advertisers.
這趟旅行誰買單？
Who paid for the trip?
我几個月前開了一個賬戶
里面有1000美元，旅行費由這個賬戶支出
It was paid for out of the $1,000 account
I had set up a few months earlier.
也就是說，你的1000美元
是唯一投入到公司的錢？
At this point, your $1,000 was the only
money that had been put into the company?
- 是的
- 你感覺那些會面進展怎么樣？
- Yes.
- How did you feel the meetings went?
- 很糟糕
- 為什么？
- They went terribly.
- Why?
馬克睡著了
Mark was asleep.
我沒有睡著
I was not asleep.
我要重述一下我的問題嗎？
Can I rephrase my answer?
我倒希望他睡著了
I wish he'd been asleep.
現在我們在29所學校有超過75000個會員
So we're in 29 schools now,
with over 75,000 members.
網民在Facebook上停留的時間
People who go on The Facebook
几乎比任何其他網站都長
tend to stay on longer
than almost any other website.
現在，這里有最令人印象深刻統計數據
Now, here's the most impressive statstic.
登錄過一次后有91%的人會再回來
91% of people who try it once
will come back.
- 現在，請你允許我…
- 抱歉，等一下
- Now, if you'll allow me...
- Excuse me one second.
他發出的是什么聲音？像“嘖嘖”？
What sound is he making? Is that like a tsk?
這不是“嘖嘖”的聲音
It wasn't a tsk.
它是…
It was...
像喉頭爆發音
Like a glottal stop.
和咽反射差不多
Almost a gag reflex.
伙計們，這是什么意思？
Guys, what is this?
紐約之行安排了多個會面
There was one more meeting scheduled
for the New York trip.
是的，還有一個晚宴
Yes, it was a dinner.
那次會面還是通過我女朋友促成的
It was set up through
my girlfriend at the time.
你說馬克對這次會面很興奮？
Would you say that Mark was
excited about this meeting?
是的，非常興奮
Yes. Very.
- 他們不會記住我們的
- 他們會
- Look, they're not gonna card us.
- They might.
- 我的意思是，你環顧四周
- 這將會很尷尬
- I mean, look around
- It'll be embarrassing.
- 告訴他，他們不會記住我們
- 他們不會記住我們
- Tell him they're not gonna card us.
- They're not gonna card us.
- 馬克
- 你要再討論有關廣告的事？
- Mark...
- Are you gonna talk about ads again?
除非你有哈特福德的芭蕾舞劇院
Unless you're the ballet theater of Hartford,
企業就是為了賺錢
the purpose of a business
is to make a profit.
這不是一個企業
It isn't a business yet.
這對我來說很難，因為我…沒關系
That's tough for me, 'cause my...
Never mind.
他遲到了25分鐘
He's 25 minutes late.
他19歲時創立了Napster，他可以遲到
（Napster音樂在線服務公司）
He founded Napster when he was 19.
He can be late.
- 他不是神
- 那他是什么人？
- He's not a god.
- Then what is he?
一個遲到25分鐘的人
He's 25 minutes late.
我認為華多是在嫉妒
I think Wardo's jealous.
老實說，我并不嫉妒，我很緊張
I honestly wasn't jealous. I was nervous.
為什么？
Why?
我并不認識他，但我網上搜了一下
也問了周圍的人
Well, I didn't know him at all, but I had
done a search and I'd asked around.
他讓我震驚了，因為他像…
And he struck me as kind of a...
一個萬金油
A wild card.
為什么？
Why?
他摧毀了兩個時尚界的互聯網大公司
He crashed out of two pretty big
Internet companies in spectacular fashion,
他因吸毒而臭名遠揚…
he's had a reputation with drugs...
是他創立了公司
He also founded the companies.
我們并不需要他
We don't need him.
他來了
He's here.
不，不，一會再說
No, no, take your time.
- 他沒有自己的手表
- 不要再說了
- And he does own a watch.
- Stop it.
- 我是肖恩﹒帕克
- 你好
- I'm Sean Parker.
- How do you do?
你們一定是愛德華多，克里斯蒂和馬克
You must be Eduardo. And Christy.
And Mark.
- 很高興認識你
- 很高興認識你
- Great to meet you.
- Great to meet you.
你們面前怎么什么都沒有
You guys don't have anything
in front of you.
- 不是
- 托里
- No.
- Tori.
我們正在等
We were waiting.
- 嘿，寶貝
- 你能上一些東西嗎？
- Hey, baby boy.
- Can you bring out some things?
姜糖豬肉，金槍魚，韃靼牛肉？
The lacquered pork with that ginger confit.
Tuna tartare?
還有龍蝦爪，那我們就開始
And the lobster claws, that'll get us started.
克里斯蒂，你喜歡喝什么？
Christy, what do you like to drink?
蘋果汁
An appletini.
太好了，四杯蘋果汁
Great. Four of those.
從那刻開始，完全是肖恩的個人秀
From that point on, it was a Seanathon.
問題是，“那你們說些什么？”
The question was,
"What did you talk about?"
他通過Napster的故事獲得我們的信任
He took us through his episode
with Napster.
我可不想花20年時間去當專業的被告
I didn't wanna spend my 20s
as a professional defendant.
誰知道？音樂產業沒有幽默感
Who knew? The music industry
doesn't have a sense of humor.
我們試圖出售公司
以支付所欠3500萬美元的版稅
We tried to sell the company to pay the
35 million they said we owed in royalties,
但我猜他們這有點像
用出售偷來的汽車去支付偷來的天然氣
but I guess to them that was a little like
selling a stolen car to pay for the stolen gas.
所以我們說拆掉它，宣告破產
So we said screw it, declared bankruptcy.
- 但你為自己贏得了聲譽
- 你沒飲料了吧
- But you made a name for yourself.
- And you are dry.
- 托里
- 不，不，我很好
- Tori!
- No, no, I'm good.
然后他繼續他的第二次創業
And then he went on to
his second business venture,
那是一個在線名片盒的網站
之后他拋售了案例股權
which was an online Rolodex that
he got thrown out of by Case Equity.
這次我想把它做好
And I wanted to do it nice this time.
我系上領帶，擦亮皮鞋
但沒有人愿意給一個孩子做訂單
I put on a tie and I shined my shoes,
but nobody wants to take orders from a kid.
因此，讓我來告訴你一個20歲小伙
如何站在炙手可熱互聯網公司的最頂端
So let me tell you what happens to
a 20-year-old at the top of a hot dot-com.
- 我不是精神科醫生，但…
- 我很慶幸我們做了記錄
- I'm not a psychiatrist, but...
- I'm glad we've got that on the record.
你不是心理醫生，但是什么？
You're not a psychiatrist, but what?
精神科醫生會說他是偏執狂
A psychiatrist would say
that he was paranoid.
他們會聘請私人偵探，不分日夜的跟蹤你
They'll hire private detectives
who'll follow you day and night.
你是個高價值的護送目標
You're a target for high-priced escorts.
我無法証明它，但我知道他們監聽我的手機
I can't prove it,
but I know they tap my phones.
不管是你已經做的旅行
Whatever it is that's gonna trip you up,
you've done already.
根本沒有私人空間
Private behavior is a relic
of a time gone by.
不管怎樣，你把你的生活管理的像達賴喇嘛
And if somehow, someway, youve managed
to live your life like the Dalai Lama,
他們才會閉嘴
they'll make shit up.
因為他們不是想要你，而是你的想法
Because they don't want you,
they want your idea.
他們希望你說“謝謝”，當你…
And they want you
to say "thank you" while you...
打擾一下
Excuse me.
…擦完下巴，然后走開的時候
...wipe your chin and walk away.
這就是發生在你身上的事？
That's what happened to you?
還有妄想症
And delusional.
是的，但是，在訴訟的時候將會有回報
Yes. But there'll be payback at Case.
我和Napster打敗了唱片公司
I brought down the record companies
with Napster
于是我離開了公司
and Case'll suffer for their sins, too.
對不起，你沒有打倒唱片公司
Sorry, you didnt bring down
the record companies.
他們贏了
They won.
- 在法庭上
- 是的
- In court.
- Yeah.
愛德華多，你想買一個塔唱片公司嗎？
（塔唱片一個著名的唱片公司）
You wanna buy a Tower Records, Eduardo?
他講完之后又講了他在硅谷的生活
And he told story after story
about life in Silicon Valley,
斯坦福的聚會，洛杉磯的困境
還有百萬富翁的朋友
and parties at Stanford and down in LA,
and friends who'd become millionaires...
他說的最多的還是勸馬克必須來加州
But mostly how Mark had to...
He had to come to California.
之后他才談到Facebook
And then he got around to The Facebook.
那么告訴我你們的進展
So, tell me about your progress.
我們現在拓展了29所學校
有超過75000名成員
Well, we're in 29 schools now.
We got over 75,000 members.
- 說說你們使用的策略
- 好的
- Tell me about the strategy you're using.
- Okay.
舉例來說
我們要拓展得克薩斯州的貝勒大學
For instance, we wanted Baylor, in Texas,
但貝勒大學已經有了社會網絡
but Baylor already had
a social network on campus.
我們不會直接進入
So instead of going right after them,
我們統計它100英里內的每個學校
we made a list of every school
wthin 100 miles...
你先把Facebook放在這些學校
You put The Facebook
on those campuses first.
很快，貝勒大學的學生看到他們的朋友
在我們的網站上，我們就打入了這個學校
Pretty soon all the Baylor kids saw
their friends on our site and we were in.
這叫拋磚引玉，很明智，馬克
It's called the Little Bighorn.
That's smart, Mark.
- 謝謝，那是我的想法
- 放松
- Thanks, that was mine.
- Easy.
你知道如何解決我們之間的爭論
Hey, you know what?
Settle an argument for us.
我的想法是時候開始從Facebook上面賺錢了
I say it's time to start making money
from The Facebook,
但是馬克不想在上面放廣告，我們倆誰對？
but Mark doesn't want advertising.
Who's right?
Well...
都不對
Neither of you yet.
Facebook很酷，它還有東西要完善
The Facebook is cool,
that's what it's got going for it.
是的
Yeah.
你不想破壞它，因為廣告可不酷
You don't wanna ruin it with ads
because ads aren't cool.
對極了
Exactly.
就像你正在校園里最大的派對玩的嗨呢
It's like you're throwing
the greatest party on campus
但有人說11點就要結束了
and someone's saying
it's gotta be over by 11:00.
就是那樣
That's exactly right.
- 你甚至不知道它究竟是什么
- 沒錯
- You don't even know what the thing is yet.
- Exactly.
它能發展多大，走多遠
沒有太多時間去考慮這些
How big it can get, how far it can go.
This is no time to take your chips down.
一百萬美元是不酷，你知道什么酷嗎？
A million dollars isn't cool.
You know what's cool?
你呢？
You?
“一億美元”
"A billion dollars."
那讓每個人震驚
And that shut everybody up.
這就是你們前進的方向，一億美元的估價
And that's where you're headed.
A billion-dollar valuation.
除非你采納了不好的建議
那樣的話你也可以趕上
Unless you take bad advice, in which case
you may as well have come up with
非常成功的酸奶連鎖店
a chain of very successful yogurt shops.
當你釣魚的時候，
你可以捉到好多魚或者捉到大魚
When you go fishing, you can catch
a lot of fish or you can catch a big fish.
你曾經走進一個伙計的洞里面
看到這樣一種情景他站在14條  魚旁邊？
You ever walk into a guy's den and see
a picture of him standing next to 14 trout?
- 不，他拿著一個3000磅重的馬林魚
- 沒錯
- No, he's holding a 3,000-pound marlin.
- Yep.
- 這是一個很好的類比
- 好吧
- That's a good analogy.
- Okay.
但我們都不知道
馬林魚是否真有3000磅，對嗎？
But we all know marlins don't really
weigh 3,000 pounds, right?
你近距離看到過大的馬林魚嗎？
Have you seen the big ones up close?
沒有，但我相信那個家伙
弄不到路虎那么大的馬林魚
No, but I don't think the guy's holding
a marlin the size of a Range Rover.
那真是一條大魚需要非常強壯的人
That would be a realy big fish
and a very strong guy.
你認為我們怎樣走的更遠？
You think we might be getting away
from the point?
我并沒有參與你們的項目
我只是一個粉絲，來和你們打聲招呼
I don't have a dog in this fight.
I'm just a fan who came to say hi.
那頓晚餐之后，馬克被他征服了
He owned Mark after that dinner.
他結了帳，告訴馬克他們會很快再次交談
He picked up the check,
he told Mark they'd talk again soon,
之后他就走了
and he was gone.
但還沒說到他為公司做出的最大貢獻呢
But not before he made his biggest
contribution to the company.
去掉網站前面的定冠詞，只要Facebook
Drop the "The." Just "Facebook."
這樣更簡潔
It's cleaner.
媽的
Shit.
再見，親愛的
Goodbye, sweetie.
Yeah.
今天說話速度真是破紀錄了
That's gotta be some kind of
land speed record for talking.
你想讓“聚會”在11點之前就結束嗎
You wanna end the party at 11:00.
- 我盡力為“聚會”湊錢
- 如果不酷的話，那就不是一個聚會
- I'm trying to pay for the party.
- There won't be a party unless it's cool.
你是怎樣認為的？
So, what do you think?
當然，我們去掉定冠詞
Yeah, sure, let's drop the "The."
我的意思是抓住馬林魚而不是14條鱒魚
I meant to catching the marlin
instead of the 14 trout.
那聽起來不好嗎？
Doesn't that sound good?
如果你是鱒魚
If you're a trout.
我將會把這記錄在案
I'm going to enter this into the record.
Facebook的公司文件
注冊在佛羅里達的限責任公司
Incorporation papers for Facebook,
an LLC registered in Florida.
- 為什么在佛羅里達？
- 我家就在那
- Why Florida?
- It's where my family lives.
問一下被告規定的公司章程
And ask the respondent to stipulate
that the articles of incorporation
公司的所有權情況如下：
馬克﹒扎克伯格占60%
state the ownership as follows:
65% for Mark Zuckerberg,
愛德華多﹒薩維林占35%
達斯汀﹒莫斯科維茨占5%
30% for Eduardo Saverin
and 5% for Dustin Moskovitz.
是的，我們這樣規定的
Yeah, we stipulate.
- 那一天是2004年4月13日
- 您可以標記一下
- And that was April 13th, 2004.
- You can mark it.
你還有其他的嗎？
You have anything here?
是的，謝謝
Yes. Thank you.
薩維林先生，你有沒有做過什么事
Mr Saverin, have you ever done anything
可以作為終止公司的正當理由？
that might be considered
legitimate grounds fortermination?
沒有
No.
你從沒做過損害公司形象和利益的事嗎？
You never did anything to embarrass the
company or even seriously jeopardize it?
- 沒有
- 沒有？
- No.
- No?
沒有
No.
你因虐待動物被起訴
You were acoused of animal cruelty.
- 等一下
- 你沒有？
- Wait.
- You weren't?
這是沒有的事
This is not happening.
這是哈佛校報上的一篇文章
I have here an article from The Crimson...
上帝啊
Jesus Christ.
華多，我不能拿這個
I can't have this, Wardo.
得了吧，哥們，純粹胡說八道
這是另一個俱樂部的惡作劇而已
Come on, man. This is bullshit.
This is another club playing a prank.
我加入了鳳凰社 
I'd gotten into the Phoenix.
作為入會儀式的一部分 
I'd been accepted,
and as part of my initiation I had to,
我必須一個星期，隨身帶著一只雞并養著它
for one week, carry with me at all times
and take care of a chicken.
他們把你作為Facebook的創始人之一
They identify you
as one of the founders of Facebook.
“合作創始人愛德華多﹒薩維林”
"Junior Eduardo Saverin..."
我雖然不是專家
但是和虐待動物牽扯到一起
I'm not the expert, but being connected
to torturing animals
可能對Facebook的事業不利
is probably bad for business.
我沒虐待小雞，我也不會去虐待小雞
你瘋了嗎？
I did not torture the chicken.
I don't torture chickens. Are you crazy?
不，先坐下來，我這兒有一篇校報文章
No, and settle down, please
I have here an article from The Crimson...
- 言辭刻薄
- 956
- This is scathing.
- 956.
我和馬克在柯克蘭食堂吃晚飯的時候
I was having dinner in
the Kirkland dining hall with Mark,
我帶了一只小雞
and I had the chicken with me,
因為我不得不一直帶著小雞
because I had to have the chicken
with me at all times.
這是在學校里
This was college.
- 某人要對這件事做一下解釋
- 969
- Somebody's gonna have to answer for this.
- 969.
當時餐廳正供應雞肉
And the dining hall
was serving chicken for dinner,
而我必須喂小雞吃的，所以我就…
and I had to feed my chicken, so I...
我就弄了一小塊雞肉，把它喂給了小雞
Well, I took little pieces of chicken
and I gave it to the chicken.
一有人定是看到我這樣做了
因為發生了接下來的事
Someone must have seen me,
because the next thing I knew
我被起訴，因為強迫小雞嗜食同類
I was being accused of forced cannibalism.
我知道你們不可能不知道這件事
I didnt know you couldn't do that.
我和各種動物權利機構解釋過了
I dealt wth the various animal rights groups,
也和副院長解釋過了
I dealt with the assocate dean
of the college.
這件事已經解決了
This was all resolved.
988.
一定是坡斯廉或是飛行俱樂部的人寫的
Someone from the Porc or the Fly
must have reported t.
就我所知，是文克萊沃斯兄弟干的
For all I know, it was the Winklevosses.
好吧，那就把它忘了吧
All right, let's just forget about it.
這真荒謬，我會因虐待動物被起訴
This is absurd.
I'm being accused of animal cruelty.
最好因戀尸狂起訴
It's better to be accused of necrophilia.
最好因戀尸狂起訴
It is betterto be accused of necrophilia.
現在我要和老爸解釋這件事
還要和所有人解釋這件事
Now I have to explain this to my father.
I'm gonna have to explain this to everybody.
這是怎么一回事？
What is happening on that?
我的“戰后及當代藝朮”就快要考試了
I have my final coming up
for Postwar and Contemporary Art
我還沒去上過課呢
and I haven't been to class.
我想我應該寫這四幅作品
I'm supposed to write about
these four paintings.
那是Facebook的頁面？
That's a Facebook page?
是的，我用別名注冊
Yeah. I opened it under an alias.
我把這些畫放上去，讓人們去評論
I posted the paintings
and asked people to comment.
每過一段時間，我登上去挑出一個好的評論
Every once in a while I hop on
and stir the pot to get a good debate going.
扎克伯格先生在期末考試中作弊了嗎？
Mr. Zuckerberg was cheating
on his final exam?
- 格雷琴，我不想回答這個問題
- 為什么不呢？
- I'd rather not answer that, Gretchen.
- And why not?
因為我不想控訴他在期末考試中作弊
Because I'm not suing him
for cheating on his final exam.
- 這不是朋友的作為
- 你剛才告訴我們，他是在作弊
- That's not what friends do.
- Well, you just told us he was cheating.
Oops.
你告訴你的律師我虐待動物？
You told your lawyers
I was torturing animals?
不，他沒有告訴我們
No, he didn't tell us about it at all.
我們的訴訟律師有能力
找到校報上面的那篇文章
Our litigators are capable
of finding a Crimson article.
事實上，當我們提到那個問題時
他在為你辯護
In fact, when we raised the subject with him,
he defended you.
Oops.
993了，我們很接近了
993. We are so close.
這提醒了我，華多，我們需要更多的錢
Yeah, that reminds me,
we're gonna need more money, Wardo.
我同意，我們需要更多的服務器
更多的幫助
Yeah, no, I agree. More servers, more help.
我要招兩個實習生
I'm interviewing two interns
to come to Palo Alto
我們要給他們點報酬
and we're gonna have
to pay them something.
- 對不起，你說什么？
- 我已經找到了出租的房子
- Sorry, what?
- I already found a house for rent
在一個街道上，離斯坦福大學校只有兩個區
on a street
two blocks from the Stanford campus.
房子很漂亮，帶游泳池
It is perfect and it's got a pool.
你何時決定夏天去加州？
When did you decide to go to California
for the summer?
你的意思是我決定什么時候？
You mean when did I actually decide?
那不是和肖恩﹒帕克會面時說的地方嗎？
Was it somewhere in the middle
of the Sean Parker Variety Hour?
他說的對，加州是我們要去的地方
He was right,
California's the place we've gotta be.
什么，你是你杰德﹒克拉珀特嗎？
What, you're Jed Clampett?
你們把《貝弗利山人》搬到了巴西
I didn't know you guys
got The Beverly Hillbillies in Brazil.
是的，我們在巴西拍戲，真是天才
Yeah, got the show in Brazil, it was genius.
- 你對肖恩有什么意見嗎？
- 他并沒有提出什么建設性的意見
- What is your problem with Sean?
- He doesn't bring anything to the table.
他并沒有錢，達斯汀是一個很好程序員
He doesn't have money.
Dustin's a better programmer.
- 他有風險投資的關系
- 我們不需要風險投資，我們需要廣告客戶
- He's got connections to VCs.
- We don't need VCs, we need advertisers.
- 我也有風險投資關系
- 他們不是真正的玩家
- And I have connections to VCs.
- No real players.
就像有人以一種糟糕的方式讓公司陷入困境
And as somebody who's just really
embarrassed the company in a bad way...
- 馬克，那是文克萊沃斯兄弟干的
- 等等
- It was the Winklevosses, Mark.
- Hang on.

- 恭喜你，兄弟
- 祝賀
- Congratulations, dude.
- Congratulations.
他被私家偵探跟著，你不覺得奇怪嗎？
You don't think it was strange that
he was followed by private detectives?
誰知道是什么
Who came up with nothing.
足以讓他離開公司，藥物還是女人
Enough to get him out of the company.
The drugs, the girls.
- 我們不知道哪一個正確
- 你可以猜一下
- We don't know that any of that's true.
- You can read about it.
我猜是你虐待鳥類，從什么時候開始
I can read about you torturing birds.
Since when...
好了，不就是大魚吃小魚嗎？
馬林魚和鱒魚？
Okay, don't fish eat other fish?
The marlins and the trout?
他在說什么？
What's he talking about?
我明天中午10點在CS實驗室面試實習生
I'm interviewing interns at 10:00
tomorrow night in the CS lab.
兄弟，加入我們吧 
Get on board with this, man.
你知道，我真的不知道還有什么可說的
You know, I don't really know
what else to say.
你可以在做一個了！在做一個！
You can do one more! One more!
華多！
Wardo!
喲，馬克！
Yo! Mark!
怎么樣了？
What's going on?
他們10分鐘內獲取了
Python網絡服務器的根權限
They have 10 minutes to get root access
to a Python web server,
破解了它的SSL加密
expose its SSL encryption,
之后阻斷了它安全端口的所有通信
and then intercept all traffic
over its secure port.
他們正在入侵
They're hacking.
都在防火牆內競爭，但精彩的在這兒
Yes, all behind a Px Firewall Emulator.
But here's the beauty.
你說的我一竅不通
You know I didn't understand
anything you just said, right?
- 我知道
- 為什么那么興奮？
- I do know that.
- So what's the beauty?
每編寫10行代碼，他們都不得不喝一口
Every tenth line of code written,
they have to drink a shot.
入侵應該是秘密行動
因為服務器每時每刻都會檢測入侵
Hacking's supposed to be stealth,
so every time the server detects an intrusion,
被檢測到的人都必須喝一口
the candidate responsible
has to drink a shot.
我也運行程序
I also have a program running
that has a pop-up window
讓他們5台電腦同時彈出窗口
appear simultaneously on all five computers.
最后點擊窗口的人必須喝一口
The last candidate to hit the window
has to drink a shot.
另外每三分鐘大家都要喝一口
Plus, every three minutes
they all have to drink a shot.
- 3分鐘！
- 快喝
- Three minutes!
- Drink one now!
我想問哪種實習一定要求喝醉？
Hey, can I ask, what part of the intern's job
will they need to be able to do drunk?
你說對了 
You're right.
測試他們能否讓雞存活一個禮拜
A more relevant test might be seeing
if they can keep a chicken alive for a week.

我開了一個新帳戶
往里面存了一萬八千美元

Yes, I got the same thing.
我可以繼續嗎？
May I continue?
既然你對扎克伯格先生接管公司
After expressing misgivings
about Mr. Zuckerberg taking the company
把它搬到加州有疑慮
and moving it to California forthe summer,
那你還為什么把一萬八千美元
存到賬戶里面供他使用呢？
why did you put $18,000
in an account for his use?
我認為我們是合作伙伴
我想成為一名合格隊員
I figured we were partners.
I wanted to be a team player.
當我在紐約和廣告客戶約談的時候
I figured Mark Dustin and the new interns
could work on the site
我想馬克，達斯汀和新的實習生
能夠搞定網站方面的事
while I was generating
advertiser interest in New York.
我想得最多是的事
在這三個月能會出多大的錯呢？
But mosty I figured, how much could
possibly go wrong in three months?
快點，快點，快點
Go, go, go, go, go.

我沒事
I'm okay.

門鈴響了
That's the doorbell.
我不知道我們有門鈴
I didn't know we had a doorbell.
- 安德魯，去開門！
- 不，他在工作
- Andrew, get the door!
- No, he's wired in.
那要從你們的押金里面扣除

我料理事兒的時候就只好擠一下了
I was crashing there for a little bit
while I'm taking care of some things,
但是她的暑假馬上就要結束了
她要回她爸媽那兒去

你的約會對象看起來這么熟悉
Your date looks so familiar to me.
很多人看起來都熟悉

你的意思是？
What do you mean?
斯坦福大學的MBA羅伊﹒雷蒙德
想給他的妻子買一件內衣
A Stanford MBA named Roy Raymond
wants to buy his wife some lingerie,
但是在百貨商場里面買，他覺得太尷尬了
but he's too embarrassed
to shop for it in a department store.
他想出了一個主意
He comes up with an idea
for a high-end place
在一個高端的地方買不會讓你感覺很怪異
that doesn't make you feel like a pervert.
他從銀行貸了四萬美元
又從親戚借了四萬美元
He gets a $40,000 bank loan,
borrows another 40,000 from his in-laws,
開了一個商店，叫做維多利亞的秘密

還貸后，他又開了三家門店
5年后，他以4百萬美元的價格
Starts a catalog, opens three more stores,
and after five years, he sells the company

我把音樂產業變得更好了

它可能沒有良好的業務，但有很多人生氣了
It may not have been good business,
but it pissed a lot of people off.
那不是和你的臉譜網站一樣？
And isn't that what your Facemash
was about?
他們害怕我，朋友，他們也會害怕你的
They're scared of me, pal,
and they're gonna be scared of you.
這就是風險投資家要說的
What the VCs want is to say,
“好主意，孩子，接下來讓大人接手吧”
"Good idea, kid,
the grown-ups will take it from here."
但不是這個時代，這是我們的時代
But not this time. This is our time.
這年頭，你手里要拿著一張名片，上面寫著：
This time, you're gonna hand them
a business card that says,
“我是總裁，婊子”
"I'm CEO, bitch."
我就想讓你變成這樣
That's what I want for you.

華多想成為一個商人
根據我的觀察會成為一個成功的商人
Wardo wants to be a businessman
and for all I know he's gonna be a good one,
但他不應該在紐約去巴結那些廣告大佬
but he shouldn't be in New York
kissing Madison Avenue's ass.
這是一個划時代的“天殺”的好主意
This is a once-in-a-generation,
"holy shit" idea.
金門大橋下面的水也很冰冷

暑假結束后，拓展100所學校？

- Oh, yeah. We're cool.
你好么，肖恩，請進
Sean, how are you? Come on in.
- 你一定是馬克了 
- 嗨
- You must be Mark.
- Hi.
我們看了資料，恭喜
We took a look at everything,
and congratulations.
我們將馬上投入50萬
We're gonna start you off
with a $500,000 investment.
莫里斯將和你們討論
關于公司重組的相關事宜
Maurice is gonna talk to you
about some corporate restructuring.
我們將在特拉華注冊一個公司
We'll file as a corporation in Delaware
提出新的股票結構，方便引入新的投資人
and come up with a stock structure
that allows for new investors.
我現在要問你點事
Now, let me ask you something.
誰是愛德華多﹒薩維林？
Who's Eduardo Saverin?
天啊
Jesus Christ.
你什么時候回來的？
When did you get back?
嚇了我一跳，下次記得敲門
You scared me. I need you to knock.
你什么時候回來的？
When did you get back?
今天下午
I got back this afternoon.
那你打算什么時候打電話給我？
And when were you gonna call me?
克莉絲，旅途不順，我很累
Chris, it was kind of a rough trip
and I was tired...
或者回一條我那可憐的47條短信？
你知道我發了47條短信給你嗎？
Yeah, or answerone of my 47 texts.
Did you know I sent 47 texts?
知道，我認為那是再正常不過的事了
I did, and I thought that was
incredibly normal behavior.
你這是在嘲笑我嗎？
Are you mocking me?
我給你帶了個禮物
I brought you a present.
為什么你的Facebook上的狀態顯示是“單身”？
Why does your Status say "single"
on your Facebook page?
什么？
What?
為什么你的Facebook上的狀態顯示是“單身”？
Why does your Relationship Status
say "single" on your Facebook page?
我注冊那時候的確是單身啊
Well, I was single when I set up the page.
那你也沒想過改一下？
And you just never bothered to change it?
你什么？
What?
我不知道怎么改
I don't know how.
我看上去很傻很好糊弄嗎？
Do I look stupid to you?
不是，你冷靜一下
No, calm down.
你讓我怎么相信一個Facebook的CFO
You're asking me to believe
that the CFO of Facebook
竟然不知道
怎么修改自己Facebook上的感情狀態？
doesn't know how to change
his Relationship Status on Facebook?
這的確挺尷尬，但你也可以理解為
這是我信任你的標志，否則我不會告訴你
It's embarrassing, so you should take it
as a sign of trust that I would tell you that.
- 去死吧你
- 放輕松
- Go to hell.
- Take it easy.
如此一來，你每次去見馬克就可以 
No, you didn't change it so you could
screw those Silicon Valley sluts
順便和硅谷的蕩婦鬼混
every time you go out to see Mark.
這絕不可能發生，我向你保証
Not even remotely true and I can
promise you that the Silicon Valley sluts
那些硅谷蕩婦們
才不在乎Facebook上的感情狀態呢
don't care what anyone's
Relationship Status is on Facebook.
拜托你拆禮物吧
Please, open your present.
你的手機還健在
Your phone does work.
馬克的電話
It's Mark.
好吧，這事有點棘手 
Okay, this is gonna be tricky.
拆開禮物，是條絲巾
Open your present. It's a silk scarf.
你見過我帶圍巾嗎？
Have you ever seen me wear a scarf?
人都有第一次
This'll be your first.
Yeah.
- 你凍結了我們的帳戶？
- 是的
- You froze our account?
- I did.
- 你竟然凍結了帳戶
- 我想有必要提醒你，馬克
- You froze the account.
- I had to get your attention, Mark.
你有沒有意識到
你的行為已經危及了整個公司？
Do you realize that you jeopardized
the entire company?
你有沒有意識到你的行為 
Do you realize that your actions
could have destroyed
將會把我所有的努力毀于一旦？
everything I've been working on?
是我們所有的努力
We have been working on.
沒有錢，網站沒法運作
Without money, the site can't function.
我來告訴你Facebook和其它網站的區別 
Let me tell you the dfference
between Facebook and everybody else.
在于永遠不會崩潰
We don't crash ever!
服務器哪怕停止運行一天
我們從此就名譽掃地了
If the servers are down for even a day, our
entire reputation is irreversibly destroyed.
- 聽著
- 用戶才不管你，朋友圈就是個教訓！
- Look...
- Users are fickle. Friendster has proved that.
即便很小一部分人的離開
都將造成整個用戶群的動蕩
Even a few people leaving would reverberate
through the entire user base.
用戶之間都是相互聯系的，這是關鍵所在！
The users are interconnected.
That is the whole point.
那些大學生在線是因為他們的朋友都在線
College kids are online
because their friends are online
如果一個多米諾骨牌倒了
其它的也隨之傾倒！
and if one domino goes,
the other dominos go.
難道你不明白嗎？
Don't you get that?
我再也不會去什么
猶太兄弟會的“加勒比之夜”了
I am not going back to
the Caribbean Night at A-E-Pi!
日你大爺！
Holy shit.
發什么神經啊你！
What is wrong with you?
你喜歡默默無聞？
Did you like being nobody?
你想被人笑話？你還想回到那種生活？！
Did you like being a joke?
Do you wanna go back to that?
稍等，稍等
Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on.
這是孩子的做法，并非爺們所為
That was the act of a child,
not a businessman,
更不像朋友所為
and it certainly was not the act of a friend.
你知道我今天拿支票去兌現有多糗嗎？
You know how embarrassing it was for me
to try to cash a check today?
我不會再回到過去那種生活
I am not going back to that life.
- 或許你會大失所望
- 是的
- Maybe you were frustrated.
- Yeah!
- 或許你會怒不可遏
- 確實是
- Maybe you were angry.
- I was!
但我決定拋棄過去一切 
But I am willing to let bygones be bygones,
因為我有條好消息要告訴你
because, Wardo,I've got some good news.
我很抱歉 
I'm sorry.
我非常生氣，這可能很孩子氣
但你一定要聽我說
I was angry, and maybe it was childish,
but I had to get your attention.
華多，我說我有好消息
Wardo, I said I've got some good news.
什么消息？
What is it?
皮特﹒泰爾給我們投資了50萬美元
Peter Thiel just made an angel investment
of half a million dollars.
什么？
What?
50萬美元，他給了我們一間新辦公室
Half a million dollars.
And he's setting us up in an office.
他們想要重組公司，要和你碰面談一談
They wanna reincorporate the company.
They wanna meet you.
簽署一些文件
They need your signature
on some documents,
所以你快給我坐第一班飛機滾回洛杉磯 
so you gotta get your ass
on the first flight back to San Francisco.
我需要我的首席財務官
I need my CFO.
馬上就到
I'm on my way.
- 華多
- 嗯？
- Wardo?
- Yeah?
我們成功了
We did it.
華多？
Wardo?
你已經要准備回去了？
You're going back there already?
是的
Yes.
還有，我要跟你分手
And also, I'm breaking up with you.
快來人阻止她！
Somebody stop her!
四份文件 
Four documents.
這兩份是常規的股票收購協議
The frst two are common stock
purchase agreements,
讓你可以在重組后的新Facebook購買股票
allowing you to buy stock
in the newly reincorporated Facebook,
也就是說舊的股份現在一文不值
as opposed to the old shares,
which are now worthless.
第三份是兌換協議
The third is an exchange agreement
你可以用舊股份兌換新股份
allowing you to exchange
the old shares for new shares,
最后一份是股東選舉協議
and then finally a voter holding agreement.
我會有多少股票？
How many shares of stock will I own?
1328334股
1,328,334.
天啊
Jesus Christ.
占總額的34.4%
That represents a 34.4% ownership share.
為什么在原有30%上追加了？
Why the increase from the original 30%?
因為稀釋后的股票可以用來吸引新的投資者
Cause you may need to dilute it
to award shares to new investors.
- 我喜歡和懂行的人打交道
- 我得告訴你
- I love working with business majors.
- I'm telling you.
- 學經濟的
- 很好
- Economics.
- Right.
你要知道馬克的股份從60%降到了51%
You should know that Mark has already
taken his percentage from 60 down to 51.
恩，馬克不在乎錢而且他需要保障
Well, Mark doesn't care about money
and he needs to be protected.
達斯汀﹒莫斯科維茨擁有6.81% 
Dustin Moskovitz owns 6.81%...
肖恩﹒帕克擁有6.47%
Sean Parker, 6.47%...
我可以靠此過活了
I can live with that.
還有皮特﹒泰爾占7%
And Peter Thiel, 7%.
要用我的筆嗎？
Would you like to use my pen?
愛德華多？愛德華多？
Eduardo? Eduardo?
你能重復一下問題嗎？
Can you please repeat the question?
不要，這是個多么難以啟齒的問題
No, it was an outrageously leading question
the first time around,
你還想聽第二遍？
and now you want us to hear it twice?
拜托你再說一遍好嗎？
Yes. Would you read it back, please?
說吧
Well, go ahead.
當你簽這些文件的時候
"Counsel: 'And when you signed
these documents,
有沒有意識到你正在簽你自己的死亡証明？
"'were you aware that you were signing
your own death certficate?"'
沒有
No.
我竟然沒有叫我的律師來檢查一下
真是太傻太天真了
It was insanely stupid of me not to have
my own lawyers look over all the...
說實話，我以為他們就是我的律師
In all honesty,
I thought they were my lawyers.
我是你唯一的朋友
I was your only friend.
你只有一個朋友
You had one friend.
我父親不會再瞧我一眼
My father won't even look at me.
愛德華多，你簽好這些文件后
扎克伯格先生沒跟你說些什么嗎？
Okay, Eduardo, did Mr. Zuckerberg say
anything to you after you signed the papers?
就是不停地握手祝賀之類的
There was a lot of handshaking,
a lot of congratulations.
他跟我說起碼
He'd already told me that he wouldn't be
一個學期他不會回學校
coming back to school
for at least a semester,
所以我們要分開一段時間了
so we were saying goodbye for a while.
我離開之前，他還說
And then before I left he said...
但你必須回來
But you gotta come back.
十一月底或者十二月初的時候
Somewhere around the end of November
or early December.
等我們突破一百萬用戶
彼得想搞個驚天動地的派對
Peter wants to throw us an amazing party
when we hit a million members.
肯定會鬧騰得不行，你一定得回來
It's gonna be out of control.
You gotta come back for it.
一百萬用戶
A million members?
是的
Yeah.
還記得柯克蘭窗戶上的數學公式嗎？
Remember the algorithm
on the window at Kirkland?
記得
Yeah.
是啊，我一定回來
Yeah, I'll be here.
你確定就這樣？
You sure about this?
你已經遲到20分鐘了
You're 20 minutes late.
你就這么進去，告訴他們你睡過頭了 
You're gonna walk in there
and say you overslept
沒時間打扮
and didn't have time to get dressed.
他們會向你極盡推銷自己
公平買賣也會向你招手
They're gonna pitch you.
Case Equity is going to pitch you.
他們會乞求你收下他們的錢
They're gonna beg you to take their money.
你就一直點頭，點頭，不停點 
You're gonna nod, you re gonna nod,
you're gonna nod,
然后就問 “你們誰是羅斯”
and then you're gonna say,
"Which one of you is Roth?"
不對，不是羅斯，是曼寧厄姆
No, not Roth. Manningham.
你們誰是米切爾﹒曼寧厄姆？
然后他會說我就是
"Which one of you is Mitchell Manningham?"
And he'll say, "I am."
那你就說肖恩﹒帕克對你說 “操你媽”
And then you say,
"Sean Parker says, 'Fuck you.'"
然后走出來
Walk out.
好的
Okay.
十一月底的時候，我收到馬克的郵件
In late November, I got the e-mail from Mark
讓我回來參加慶祝百萬用戶的派對
telling me to come out
for the millionth-member party.
郵件還說了什么？
What else did the e-mail say?
還說我們要開個工作會議
It said that we had to have
a business meeting.
還說馬克和肖恩做了些小動作
報復公平買賣
That Mark and Sean had played
some kind of revenge stunt on Case Equity,
曼寧厄姆太讓人印象深刻了
and that Manningham was so impressed
因為他開出了令人難以拒絕的條件
that he was now making an investment offer
that was hard to turn down.
我到達加州，直接去了新辦公室
So I went to California,
and I went straight to the new offices.
我不清楚該穿正裝還是派對裝
I didn't know whether to dress for the party
or for the business meeting,
所以就穿了百搭款
so I kind of dressed for both.
- 但那并不重要
- 為什么
- But it didn't matter.
- Why not?
因為我去那里并不是為了其中任何一個
Because I wasn't called out there
for either one.
那是為了什么？
What were you called out there for?
一場伏擊
An ambush.
薩維林先生，你好，就在這里
Mr Saverin. Hey. Right over here.
嘿
Hey, man.
- 你還好么？
- 不錯，你呢？
- How are you?
- Good. How are you?
- 好得不得了  
- 很高興見到你
- Good, good, good, good, good.
- Good to see you.
起初我以為他在開玩笑，要我簽更多的合同
At first I thought he was joking.
Giving me more contracts to sign.
然后我開始看細則
But then I started reading.
這是什么？
Wait, what is this?
恩，你知道的，我們引入了一些新的投資者
Well, as you know, we had some
new investors that have come in.
這是什么？
What is this?
薩維林先生
Mr. Saverin.
馬克！
Mark!
- 馬克呢？
- 他在工作
- Mark?
- He's wired in.
- 什么？
- 他在工作
- Sorry?
- He's wired in.
- 是嗎？
- 對
- Is he?
- Yes.
- 現在呢？你還在工作？
- 叫保安！
- How about now? Are you still wired in?
- Call security.
你發行了超過2400萬股的新股票
You issued 24 million new shares of stock!
之前就告訴你如果有新的投資者加入
You were told that if new investors
came along...
你的股份會被稀釋多少？他的呢？
How much were your shares diluted?
How much were his?
扎克伯格先生的股份稀釋到了多少？
What was Mr. Zuckerberg's
ownership share diluted down to?
沒有稀釋
It wasn't.
莫斯柯維茨先生的股份稀釋到了多少？
What was Mr. Moskovitz's ownership share
diluted down to?
沒有稀釋
It wasn't.
肖恩﹒帕克的股份稀釋到了多少？
What was Sean Parker's ownership share
diluted down to?
沒有稀釋
It wasn't.
彼得﹒泰爾的股份稀釋到了多少？
What was Peter Thiel's ownership share
diluted down to?
沒有稀釋
It wasn't.
你的股份稀釋到了多少？
And what was your ownership share
diluted down to?
0.03%
.03%
- 你簽了那些文件 
- 你陰我
- You signed the papers.
- You set me up.
你要怪我因為你是公司的負責人
You're gonna blame me because you were
the business head of the company,
而你做讓公司做虧本買賣？
and you made a bad business deal
wth your own company?
好像我不是Facebook的一分子 
It's gonna be like I'm not a part of Facebook.
不是好像你不是Facebook的一分子 
It won't be like
you're not a part of Facebook.
你本來就不是
You're not a part of Facebook.
- 刊頭上有我的名字
- 你可以核對一下
- My name's on the masthead.
- You might wanna check again.
這是因為我凍結了賬戶的關系？
This because I froze the account?
你覺得我們會讓你
穿著這么可笑的西裝招搖過市
You think we'd let you
parade around in your ridiculous suits,
假裝你是公司的頭兒？
pretending you were running this company?
對不起，我的普拉達還在干洗店
Sorry, my Prada's at the cleaner's!
有我的衛衣，我的“草泥馬”人字拖
你這驕傲自大的二逼
Along with my hoodie and my fuck-you
flip-flops, you pretentious douchebag!
保安在這里，你現在就離開
Security's here. You'll be leaving now.
- 我不會簽那些文件
- 我們會拿到簽名的
- I'm not signing those papers.
- We will get the signature.
告訴我這和我進鳳凰俱樂部無關
Tell me this isn't about me
getting into the Phoenix.
是你，是你干的，我知道是你
你炮制了那個虐雞新聞
You... You did it. I knew you did it.
You planted that story about the chicken!
- 我沒有那么干
- 他在說什么
- I didn't plant that story.
- What's he talking about?
- 你想讓我因虐待動物被起訴
- 嚴肅點，那只雞到底怎么回事？
- You had me acoused of animal cruelty.
- Seriously. What the hell's the chicken?
我打賭你不樂意聽
And I'll bet what you hated the most
他們認定我是Facebook的共同創始人
is that they identified me
as a co-founder of Facebook.
就是我，你最好快把你律師叫來，混蛋！
Which I am. You better lawyer up, asshole.
因為我回來不是為了那30%股份
我將要回所有一切
'Cause I'm not coming back for 30%.
I'm coming back for everything.
- 把他拉出去
- 好了，我自己走
- Get him out of here.
- It's okay, I'm going.
等等
Hang on.
差點忘了
Almost forgot.
這是你的19000美元，不過我沒法兌現
Here's your $19,000.
I wouldn't cash it, though.
這是從被你凍結的帳戶上划的
I drew it on the account you froze.
我喜歡站在你身邊，肖恩
I like standing next to you, Sean.
這讓我看上去很男人
It makes me look so tough.
那么
Well...
就是這樣，今天的演出到此結束
That's it, that's our show for tonight, people.
恩，我想看到每一個人都盛裝出席派對
And look, I wanna see everyone here
geared up for a party.
我們要像梅西大游行一樣走進俱樂部
We're gonna walk into that club
like it's the Macy's Parade.
麥基，切到大屏幕，我們就快達到了
Mackey, put it up on the big screen.
We've gotta almost be there.
- 你還好吧？ 
- 恩
- You all right?
- Yeah.
你對他太粗魯了
You were kind of rough on him.
那才是NFL的腔調
That's life in the NFL.
你沒必要對他這么粗魯
You know you didn't have to be
that rough on him.
- 聽著，我把他
- 肖恩！
- Listen, I put him...
- Sean!
你沒必要對他這么粗魯
You didn't have to be that rough on him.
他几乎毀了它！
He almost killed it.
我會送花道歉的
I'll send flowers.
說到花，Kappa Eta Sigma的派對
結束之后，還有一個派對
Speaking of flowers, I'm putting together
a party after the party at Kappa Eta Sigma.
麥基弗有個妹妹
Ashleigh's a sister.
- 麥基弗？
- 那個實習生
- Ashleigh?
- The intern.
我知道她是誰，你們兩個？
Yeah. I know who she is. Are you guys...
麥基弗？我？不是
Ashleigh? Me? No.
恩，有一點
Well, a little bit.
為什么？
Why?
- 不，沒什么，我只是…
- 打擾一下，馬克？
- No. Nothing, I just...
- Excuse me. Mark?
- 我們正在說你
- 你干得不錯
- We were just talking about you.
- Just that you're doing a really good job.
謝謝，我很榮幸
Thanks. I appreciate that.
這是給你的
These came in for you.
放我桌上
Put them on my desk.
包裹里是什么
What's the package?
沒什么
Nothing.
- 麥基
- 是的，先生
- Mackey.
- Yes, sir.
刷新！
Refresh.
給力啊！
Sweet!
我知道你需要擁抱
And you're not a hugger.
I know.
100萬 
One million!
誰有香檳？
Who's got champagne? Huh?
我這有香檳
I've got champagne.
下一個革新性的進展是圖片共享的應用
The next transformative development,
a picture-sharing application.
你可以瀏覽圖片并且與好友們分享
A place where you view pictures
that coincide with your socal life.
這才是名副其實的數字化生活
It is the true digitalization of real life.
- 你可以用CD碟啊 
- 你可以在我身上弄哦
- You can use a CD.
- You can do it off of me.
你不再空著手去派對 
You don't just go to a party anymore.
而是帶著你的數碼相機
你的好友們將在網上重現
You go to a party with a digital camera,
and then your friends relive the party online.
你還可以加標簽
And tagging. The idea...
- 把胸罩脫了會不會更方便
- 不妨一試
- Would this be easier without the bra?
- It's worth finding out.
關掉音樂，馬上
All right, shut the music down!
派對結束 
The party's over!
所有人回家
Everybody, go home!
我花了很多時間
觀察人們登陸后都干了些什么
I've spent hours watching
what people do when they log on.
他們查看好友的狀態更新
How they check their friends' status updates.
太奇怪了，音樂怎么停了
Wait. That's weird. Why did the music stop?
查看他們哪些好友修改了個人資料
Check to see which one of their friends
更換了頭像，還有…
changed their profiles,
changed their photos...
老實說，音樂怎么了？
Seriously, what happened to the music?
我們以前住在農場之后住在城市
We lived on farms
and then we lived in cities,
現在我們將會住在網絡上
and now we're going to live on the Internet!
肖恩，停一下，我想樓下好像出事了
Sean, stop.
I think something's going on downstairs.
女士們先生們，請注意了
Ladies and gentlemen,
can I have your attention, please?
你們該回家了，派對結束了
It's time for you to go home.
The party is over.
這樣很爽呢
Then it's all good.
- 是警察！
- 什么？
- It's the cops.
- What?
靠
Shit! Shit.
- 我靠，該死，該死
- 好吧，沒事的，冷靜點
- Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
- Okay, it's okay. Be cool.
很高興見到你，長官，需要我幫忙嗎？
Good to see you, Officer.
What can I do for you?
發生什么事了？
What's going on?
音樂是不是太吵了？我們正在慶祝
Was the music too loud?
We were having a celebration.
女士，請把衣服扣上
Miss, I need you to button your blouse.
我可以讓他們把音樂關小嗎
I can tell them to turn the music down.
那不是我的
That's not mine.
我們需要確認下你們的身份
把手都放在我們看的見的地方
Okay, we're gonna need identification.
Keep your hands where we can see them.
天啊，不是吧
Oh, my God.
口袋里有些什么，告訴我？
You got anything else in your pockets
I should know about?
沒有，長官，沒有
No, sir. No.
- 別犯傻了
- 我沒有，我沒有
- Don't be stupid, now.
- I don't, I don't.
這什么？
What's this?
腎上腺素
That's an EpiPen.
- 這個呢？
- 我的呼吸器
- And this?
- That's my inhaler.
21歲
How old are you?
21歲
Twenty-one.
我21歲
Twenty-one.
- 21歲
- 我21歲
- Twenty-one.
- I'm 21.
坦白從寬，抗拒從嚴！
Lying only makes it worse.
對不起，我不該撒謊
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have lied.
喂？
Hello.
聽著，發生了些事
Listen, something's happened.
靠
Shit.
沒事，沒事，我已經保釋出來了
No, it's all right. It's gonna be all right.
我什么都沒做，我，我是過敏體質
I posted bond, and I wasn't doing anything.
I mean, I've got allergies.
實習生
Interns.
這只是個派對
It was just a party.
這可是大新聞，肖恩，很快就會在網上瘋傳
This is gonna be news, Sean.
It's gonna be online any second.
我知道
I know.
你知道跟一個實習生…
You know with an intern...
沒事，我一定能搞定
No, it's cool. I have it under control.
我會搞定的
I will get it under control.
我去打個電話，看看下一步怎么走
I will call someone
and see what the next move is.
但這已經造成轟動了
But this is gonna be news now.
你覺得愛德華多沒有牽涉其中，對嗎 ？
You don't think Wardo
was involved, do you?
我的意思，你認為…
I mean, do you think...
不
No.
或者曼寧厄姆，他們中的一個 
Or Manningham. One of them.
把可卡因帶了進來
Somebody. Somebody sent the coke
in there, because it got in there.
相信我，會沒事的
You believe me. God, this is gonna be fine.
是嗎？
Right?
回家去，肖恩
Go home, Sean.
馬克
Mark?
馬克
Mark.
今天的會議結束了
We're done for the day.
恩，我就坐坐
Yeah. Yeah, I was just sitting here.
肖恩怎么了？
What happened to Sean?
他還有7%的公司股份
He still owns 7% of the company.
你一整天就吃了份沙拉，你不想吃些什么嗎？
All you had all day was that salad.
Do you wanna get something to eat?
不要
I can't.
我不是壞人
I'm not a bad guy.
我知道
I know that.
主觀的說，我們假設85%是被夸大的
When there's emotional testimony,
