醫學中心
理查德  根據你所有檢查的結果
Well, Richard, according to all of your test results,
你這種情況在醫學界叫作
you are what we in the medical field call
健康
healthy.
事實上  你身上有一種光彩
In fact, you've got kind of a glow about you.
-真的嗎  -千真萬確
- Oh, really? - Absolutely.
如果不是醫學上不可能
You know, if it were medically possible,
我甚至以為你懷孕了
I might even think that you were pregnant.
當然了  我以為我女朋友懷孕了
Of course, I thought my girlfriend was pregnant,
但我確信我錯了
and I was sure wrong about that.
把戒指還給我
Hey, give me that ring back!
真是一團糟
What a mess.
真是一團糟
What a mess that was.
最近你有做什么大的改變嗎
So, been any big changes for you,
比如控制飲食或者鍛煉
diet or exercise?
事實上我被解雇了
Well, I actually got fired
從我自己公司首席執行官的位置上
as CEO of my company.
我現在是首席技術官
I'm working now as the CTO
匯報給新首席執行官杰克·巴克
under the new CEO, Jack Barker.
等等  你在你自己的公司有了個老板
Wait a minute. You got a boss at your own company?
是的  我知道這聽起來不太好
Yeah, I know that sounds bad,
但事實上  他掌管所有的預算
but honestly, he handles all the budgeting,
所有風險投資
all the VC funding.
他剛剛給我們租了一個
He just negotiated a great new lease
超棒的新辦公室
on our new offices.
我不知道  我覺得這對我來說是好事
I don't know. I think this could be great for me.
孩子  我不覺得我能接受
Boy, I don't think I could have another doctor
另外一個醫生來這當我的老板
coming in here, being my boss.
不行  就像是  "老板
No. It'd be like, "Hey, boss,
我能聽聽他的心跳嗎
Is it okay if I listen to his heart?
可以嗎  不可以  抱歉
Can I do that? Oh, no? Sorry.
那我不聽了  好吧
No, I won't. Okay.
你說什么就是什么"
Whatever you say!"
-真有趣  -是很有趣
- Ah, funny. - It is funny. Yeah.
不過  如果你覺得可以  也很好
But listen, if it works for you, that's great.
只是還有件事
Just one more thing.
我需要檢查一下你的睪丸
I've gotta check your testicles.
天啊  好吧
Oh my God. Okay.
是檢查疝氣什么的嗎
What, for like a hernia or something?
不  我只想確定它們還在
No. I just wanna make sure they're still there.
這就是我們的新辦公室嗎
This is going to be our office?
所有這些
All of this?
是的  杰克說整層樓都是我們的
Yeah, Jack said we have the whole floor.
看看那廚房  太棒了
Wow, look at that kitchen. This is great.
理查德  那是我們的新標志嗎
Richard, is that our new logo?
魔笛手
我喜歡  簡潔優雅
I like it. It's clean and elegant,
但又不是完全無害
but not without some danger.
先生們  歡迎
Gentlemen, welcome.
我去掉了吹長笛的那位仁兄
I moved away from the flute-playing guy.
不知道你們有沒有發現
I don't know if you guys realized it,
那有一點生殖崇拜
but that was a little phallic.
我不想在這上面浪費你們的時間
I didn't want to waste your time with it,
所以我就自己決定了
so I just pulled the trigger.
這是馬里·謝布萊設計的
Mari Sheibley did this.
社交網站Foursquare首席設計師
馬里·謝布萊
Mari Sheibley.
一定讓你破費了
That must've set you back a bit.
沒有  她是我的朋友
No. She's a friend.
我也...認識她
Yeah. I know her... as well.
偶然認識的
Casually.
何不讓我帶你們參觀一下你們的新家呢
So, why don't I show you guys your new home?
希望這滿足你們的標準
Hopefully, it lives up to your standards.
跟我們之前住的小破屋相比
Yeah, compared to the shit shack we're used to,
任何地方都是進步
anything's an improvement.
侮辱源于尊重
An insult born of respect.
如果我們開始互相恭維  我才擔心
I'll worry when we start complimenting each other.
去死吧
Fucking dick.
我猜你們看到了弘樹放置的水的設施
I assume you saw Hiroki putting in the water feature.
風水好  這很重要
Good feng shui. Gotta have that.
這里是工程師區域
This is the engineering area.
這是我們工作的地方嗎
We're gonna work here?
那里有一個獨立的配有專業人員的
That is a separate, professionally-catered
小廚房
micro-kitchen back there.
希望你們在頭腦饑餓  但絕不肚餓
I want you hungry here, never here.
這些都太棒了  但我們真的支付得起嗎
This is all great, but can we really afford all this?
來我的辦公室  理查德
Hey, step into my office, Richard.
-這里  -好吧
- Here. - Okay.
我想給你看點東西
I wanna show you something.
這里比埃利希那鬼地方好多了
This is way better than Erlich's shithole.
成功的三大基石
"成功的三大基石"
"The Conjoined Triangles of Success"?
我發明的
I invented that,
現在商學院都在教這個
and now it's taught at business schools.
看到最底下是什么了嗎
You see what's on the bottom here?
一切的基礎
The foundation of the whole thing.
-發展  -發展
- Growth? - Growth.
越多的聰明人來這里工作
The more brilliant people we can get working here,
我們就能越快地
then the faster we can get
將你腦海中的想法展示給全世界
whatever is in your head out into the world.
讓我給你講個故事
Let me tell you a story.
1999年
In 1999,
谷歌還只是個小創業公司  像我們這樣
Google was a little startup, just like we are.
當他們開始引進廚師和女按摩師時
And when they started bringing in chefs and masseuses,
我們認為  "他們是傻瓜"
we thought, "They're nuts!"
但他們吸引了最棒的人才
But they were attracting the best possible people,
從而能夠創造出最棒的產品
and they were able to create the best product,
現在他們市值超過四千億
and now they're worth over $400 billion.
你知道這家公司叫什么嗎
And do you know the name of that company?
不是谷歌嗎  你一開始就說了
Google, right? You said it at the beginning of the story.
你說得對  我不該說的
You're right. I did that wrong.
但重點是
And the whole point is
這一切都是可靠的投資
that all of this is a sound investment
只要我們能招到最好的人才
as long as we are able to get the best people
做出最棒的產品
and make the best possible product.
好吧  誰贏誰拿大顯示器
All right. Winner gets the big monitor.
我知道規則
I understand how this works.
準備好了
Ready?
石頭  剪子  布
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.
接受現實吧
Suck it.
早該知道你會出石頭
I should've known you'd throw rock.
你們巴基斯坦人都這樣  本性
That's all you know in Pakistan. It's in your blood.
是不是你們那猜拳就叫  石頭  石頭  石頭
Don't you guys call it "Rock, Rock, Rock"?
你真逗  把你那堆種族歧視的笑話都打在
That's funny. You should type up all your racist jokes
你那小顯示器上吧
on your tiny monitor.
顯示器不夠大嗎
Is that monitor not big enough?
需要更大的嗎
You need a bigger monitor?
只要寫在那邊的單子上
You just put it on the list over there,
采購的人會幫你搞定的
and our purchasing guy will hook you up.
-真的嗎  -必須的
- Seriously? - Absolutely.
賈里德  你呢  需要什么新辦公設備嗎
Hey, Jared, how about you? You need any new gear for the office?
不用了  我自帶電腦
No, I'm BYOC.
需要什么盡管講
Let me know if you need anything.
理查德  這個紙箱可以給我嗎
Richard, do you think it'd be okay if I took this box?
下班后我要搬家  不住諾亞的客房了
I'm moving out of Noah's guest house after work.
然后睡紙箱里嗎
And you want to sleep in that box?
不是
No.
我很久沒睡紙箱了  快別逗了
I haven't slept in a box in years. Stop.
既然'魔笛手'拿到了投資
Now that Pied Piper's funded,
我就住得起原來的公寓了
I have enough money to move back into my condo.
是嗎  祝賀
Oh. Congratulations.
我還以為你已經賣掉了
I thought you sold it.
沒有  我掛到Airbnb上租出去了
No, I've been AirBNB'ing it out
賺點錢還貸款
to cover the mortgage.
但能回家住還是挺好的
But it'll be good to get home.
一直很想念我的浴缸
I've been missing my tub a lot,
而且最近諾亞總跟我講些仇恨言論
and Noah's been using a lot of hate speech with me lately,
搬回家最好
so moving will be a good thing.
好了各位  我要走了
All right, guys, think I'm gonna take off
除非你們需要我再待會兒  幫你們過渡
unless you need me to stick around, help you transition.
我…怎么幫
I-- By doing what?
可以帶你們認識些其他在這里工作的人
I could introduce you to some of the people that work here.
我和弘樹混得可熟了
I made some major inroads with Hiroki.
免了  為什么要認識其他人
No. Why would we want that?
有道理
Fair-- yeah, fair point.
那就這樣了  歡迎入駐新家
So, welcome to your new home.
盡情享受  這可都是我的功勞
Enjoy it, guys. I gave you this.
抱歉
Sorry. Sorry.
互利
大家今早過得怎樣
How was everyone's morning?
給你們講講我的
Let me tell you about mine.
今早  我像往常一樣
I started my day, as I always do,
用'互利'引擎搜索我自己的名字
by typing my own name into Hooli-Search.
我喜歡這個能讓我以自己為中心的習慣
I enjoy the ritual, which is designed to center me.
但最近的檢索結果適得其反
But lately, it's been doing the opposite.
這是誰的工作臺
Whose work station is this?
看好了
Observe.
蓋文·貝爾森
紐核力慘敗  蓋文·貝爾森會同歸于盡嗎
紐核力漏洞頻出  蓋文·貝爾森無以立足
漫談蓋文·貝爾森紐核力慘劇
壓縮敗局  互利CEO蓋 文·貝爾森手下紐核力對其極為不利
這都是我砍掉紐核力之前的舊聞
These are all remnants of a time before I wrote Nucleus down.
為什么要讓我們自己的技術
Why are we allowing our own technology
時刻提醒我們痛苦的過去
to dredge up our painful past?
為什么我用自己公司的搜索引擎
Why is it that when I type my own name
搜自己的名字
into my own company search engine,
還得被這該死的互聯網糊一臉狗屎
the fucking Internet rains shit-bolts down on me?
這必須立即停止
I want this to stop!
可這些文章都是公開記錄
These articles are part of the public record.
所以呢
Your point?
您言下之意是要我們
Are you suggesting that we alter
更改互利搜索算法根基的中立性嗎
the fundamental neutrality of the Hooli-Search algorithm?
那可是公然失信于公眾
That's a clear violation of the public trust.
Yelp正以同一原因威脅要告谷歌呢
Yelp is threatening to sue Google for this very thing.
憑良心講  我無法 
I can't, in good conscience,
要求互利搜索的工程師們這么做
order Hooli-Search engineers to do that.
我從沒說過任何跟這有關的事
I never suggested anything of the sort.
互利搜索的工程師
No Hooli-Search engineer
永遠不會被要求改變算法中立原則
will ever be asked to alter the neutrality of the algorithm.
紐核力
蓋文希望  互利搜索結果中
And so, Gavin doesn't want to see
不要再有任何紐核力的負面消息
any more negative mentions of Nucleus on Hooli-Search.
所以...還是要改搜索算法嗎
So... we're gonna alter the search algorithm?
當然不行  那有違職業道德
Of course not. That would be unethical.
那要怎么辦
What are we supposed to do?
推廣其它網站  擠掉紐核力相關新聞嗎
Promote other websites to outrank the bad Nucleus news?
你知道這他媽有多操蛋嗎
Do you have any idea how big a fucking job that is?
你還敢罵我
Don't you swear at me.
我們都不是互利員工了
We don't work here anymore.
還有10天呢
For 10 more days you do!
除非你們想立馬辭職走人
Unless you'd all like to quit and walk away
解雇補償協議也甭要了
from your entire severance packages!
真夠可以的
Amazing.
賈里德  老天
Jared. Whoa.
最近怎么樣
What's up?
抱歉  我有點不明白
I'm sorry, I'm a little confused.
你周二就該搬出去了
You-- you were supposed to be out on Tuesday.
的確  但計劃有變
Oh, I was, but plans have changed.
你看
See...
我實在沒錢另找地方  也付不起房租
I can't really afford to move or pay rent,
所以我得多住幾天
so I'm gonna have to stay a little while.
好吧
Okay, look...
我理解你的困境
I appreciate your situation,
但這違反了我們的合同
but... you're breaking the terms of our contract.
我不想跟你不客氣
Listen, I don't want to be a dick,
只是這附近房租太高了
it's just I can't afford to live around here.
我住不起
'cause the rent is so high,
都怪那些科技公司  對吧
because of the tech companies, right?
而你就在這些科技公司供職
And you bought this place with the money you made
用薪水買了這房子
working at the tech companies,
所以算我們扯平了
so... it kind of all evens out, right?
這根本講不通
That-- that makes no sense.
是吧
I know. Right?
這樣  我可以給你緩幾天
Okay, look, I can give you a few days,
最多兩星期
two weeks tops,
但如果到時你還不搬出去
but if you're not out by then,
我就要走法律途徑了
I'm gonna have to take legal action.
哥們  你這太掃興了
This bums me out, man.
還以為你是那幫IT男里唯一夠酷的
I thought you were like the one cool tech guy.
我嗎
Me?
說真的嗎
Are you sure?
不再如此了
Not anymore.
那...
Well...
加州住宅里的居民
Well, the occupant of a residence in California
幾乎有無限的權利啊
has almost unlimited rights.
我得獲得他的允許才能進自家大門
I have to get his permission to enter my property.
我又不能給他停電或停煤氣
I can't turn off the power or the gas,
還得請個律師
and I have to hire a lawyer
啟動法律驅逐程序  那可不便宜
to start a legal eviction. That won't be cheap.
天吶  真抱歉  太糟了
Jeez, man. I'm sorry. That sucks.
那你昨晚在哪睡的
So, where did you sleep last night?
我沒睡  你睡得怎么樣
I did not. How was your sleep?
還不錯
It was-- it was good, yeah.
睡得像死豬一樣
I mean, I slept like a stone.
什么事都不用自己做的感覺好奇怪
It's odd not having to do everything ourselves, isn't it?
對啊  我其實還挺喜歡的
Yeah, I'm-- I'm kinda loving it.
你們準備去上班了嗎
Hey, you ready to go to work?
艾米大廚問我早餐想吃什么
Chef Amy asked us what we wanted for breakfast,
我說  給我們個驚喜吧
and I said, "surprise us."
一切皆有可能哦  走吧
Could be anything. Let's go!
你啥時候見過這倆貨
When was the last time you saw those two
-中午之前出過門  -可不是嘛
- go anywhere before noon? - Indeed.
那我們去吃無麩華夫餅吧
Well, let's go get some gluten-free waffles.
抱歉  劇透了
Oh. Sorry about the surprise.
-我無所謂  -我讓艾米大廚告訴我的
- I don't care. - I asked Chef Amy to tell me.
我飲食有太多限制了
I have too many dietary restrictions
不能隨便吃早餐
to leave breakfast to chance.
-有道理  -我的兩個被孵人
- Makes sense. - Ah, two of my incubees
要去吃遍全世界了
off to eat the world.
保持健康  努力工作  了解彼此
Be well, work hard, and know one another.
好的
Okay.
我最近幫他們給'魔笛手'安排了個新CEO
I recently helped them install a new CEO at Pied Piper.
我得采取放任自流的管理辦法
I needed to take a more hands-off approach,
專注未來  也就是像你這樣的被孵人
focus on the future-- incubees, like yourself,
想法宏大  比如給惡意軟件分類
with great ideas, like cataloging malware.
夠性感  想再來瓶椰汁嗎
Sexy. Uh, would you care for another coconut water?
這可是未經高溫消毒飲品里最貴的了
They are the most expensive unpasteurized variety,
如果你擔心這個的話
if that's any concern.
其實我擔心的是我的房間
Actually, my concern is the room.
和垃圾堆沒什么兩樣啊
It's kind of a dump.
現在確實是的
Oh, sure, now.
但是等到重新粉刷之后
But with a new coat of paint,
你下個月搬進來時就認不出它了
you'll hardly recognize the place when you move in next month.
其實
Actually...
我走了狗屎運
shit's pivoted.
我下周就要找到住處
I need a place next week.
下周  還真是狗屎運
Next week? Oh, shit has pivoted.
那我得和現在的租客說一下
Well, I'll talk to the current tenant.
告訴他是時候...
Let him know that the time has... come.
我勒個去
Mother... fuck.
比如  是時候卷鋪蓋走人了
Yeah, put him on a slow boat to China, so to speak.
對不起  脫口而出了
I'm sorry. It just slipped out.
我讓艾米大廚給你做點別的
I'll ask Chef Amy to make you something else.
不用了  我想吃華夫餅
No, no, no, I want waffles.
我只是想要驚喜  賈里德
I just wanted them to be a surprise, Jared.
我想吃驚喜華夫餅
I wanted surprise waffles.
這都是什么人
Who are these people?
我也不知道
Uh, I don't know.
杰克已經雇好工程師了嗎
Did Jack hire engineers already?
這些人一看就不是當工程師的料
These people are not in the engineering gene pool.
說得對
That's right, fellas.
這是我們的新銷售人員
These are our new sales people.
他們可是業內精英
They're the best in the business.
銷售  杰克
Sales? Uh, Jack?
杰克
Jack?
我們難道不該先招工程師來建平臺
Shouldn't we hire engineers to build the platform
然后再找人把它們賣出去嗎
before we get people to sell it?
不
No.
天吶  不
God, no!
理查德  體系是這樣的
The system, Richard.
銷售和工程師是"成功的三大基石"
Sales and engineering are the two pillars
其中的兩大支柱
of the Conjoined Triangles of Success.
工程師和銷售人員必須合作
Yeah. Engineering and sales must work together
來決定構建怎樣的平臺
to decide what to build.
還有誰能比
Who knows better what the customers' need
每天和客戶打交道的人
than the people who actually deal with
更了解客戶的需求呢
the customers every single day?
我們一點鐘開會  理查德
We're all gonna meet at 1:00, Richard.
你會愛上這群人的  他們是最棒的
You're gonna love these guys. They're the best.
雖然'互利'的訴訟案件
So, while the Hooli lawsuit
確實妨礙了我們籌資
did hamper our ability to get funding,
卻沒有影響平臺構建的進程
it did not slow down the engineering.
有問題嗎
Yes, question?
東北區銷售部  基斯
Yeah, Keith, Northeast Regional.
你認為未來不會出現技術債務
So, you don't foresee any technical debt issues
減緩我們擴大業務規模的速度嗎
slowing our ability to scale?
不會  完全不會的
Actually, no, none whatsoever.
我們考慮了所有潛在問題
We've identified all our underlying issues,
并且為快速增長制定好了計劃
and we have a plan in place for rapid growth.
請講
Uh, yes?
唐  全球財務與系統整合部
Don, Global Accounts and Systems Integration.
你所計劃的是怎樣的增長呢
What kind of growth are you projecting here?
聽起來可能有點不靠譜
Well, this may sound a little bit grandiose,
但我認為我們有潛力
but it's not unrealistic
達到像谷歌和臉書那樣
to think that we have the potential
在全球的滲透規模
for worldwide penetration
這絕非天方夜譚
on the scale of, say, Google or Facebook.
非常好  理查德  繼續
This is really great, Richard. Just keep going.
好的
Sure. Yeah.
至于網站上線
Well, in regards to the launch,
我們希望廣泛推廣
we are hoping to go wide,
用戶越多越好
get it into the hands of as many people as possible.
簡  內部銷售主管
Jan, Director, Inside Sales.
他們都叫我"簡犀利"
They call me "Jan the Man."
你剛才說的"用戶"  指的是公司吧
When you say "people," You mean "companies," Right?
對啊  我們是面向企業的
Yeah, we're business-facing.
好的  我就是想弄清楚
Okay, just wanted to clarify.
不是的  抱歉  簡犀利
Actually, no. No, sorry, Jan the Man.
我剛才說的用戶指的就是"人"
By "people," I do mean "people."
人  消費者
Humans. Consumers.
基斯  東北區的  又是我
Keith, Northeast Regional, again.
杰克說
Jack told us
我們的銷售直接面對企業
we would be selling directly to businesses.
-是嗎  -道格  跟基斯見習的
- He did? - Doug. I'm shadowing Keith.
-是  -是啊  我也在場
- Yes, he did. - Definitely. I was there.
又是我  唐
Don, again.
抱歉讓你們誤會了
Well, I'm sorry for the misunderstanding,
因為我們的計劃
because the plan has always been...
一直是免費轉付費模式  像Dropbox一樣
entirely based on the freemium model, like Dropbox?
一開始平臺是對用戶免費開放的
You know, you give the platform away free to consumers,
等到用戶基數足夠大了
and then once you have a big enough user base,
再對企業客戶出售高級服務
then you sell premium services to businesses.
如果現在是免費的
If we're giving it away now
過一陣子才打算出售
and waiting until later to sell it,
那我們來干什么
what are we doing here now?
不知道  不知道
I don't know. I don't know.
我們大概可以問杰克
We could maybe ask Jack...
等他從什么地方...
when he gets back from wherever...
抱歉  等一下  很快
Sorry, one second. Just-- just one moment.
杰克  抱歉  杰克
Jack. Sorry, Jack.
抱歉  杰克
Sorry. Excuse me, Jack.
你要走了嗎
Are you leaving?
我要參加個慈善酒會
Oh, I have this charity wine thing.
抱歉  幾個月前就答應了
Sorry, I committed to it months ago,
你在里面講得真好  理查德
but you are killing it in there, Richard.
其實沒有
Well, actually no.
不好意思  他們剛說
Sorry. They just said
你說我們是面向企業的
that you told them that we would be business-facing?
他們通知你了  很好
Ah, they filled you in. That's good.
我還以為是先面向消費者
I was under the impression that we would be consumer first.
我的人都確定這點了
My guys are pretty set on that.
理查德  我看了你的計劃
Richard, I read your deck,
你打算四年后再考慮盈利嗎
and you projected it'll be four years until we get to revenue?
是啊
Uh, yeah.
你知道現在是在泡沫里吧
You know we're in a bubble right now, right?
沒準你不知道  上次泡沫時你還不在
Or maybe you don't know. You weren't around for the last bubble.
你還尿褲子呢吧
You were probably in diapers.
那時我11歲了  不尿褲子了
I was 11. Well, I wasn't in diapers.
我  我也不尿了
I don't-- I wasn't either.
我見證了
I was there.
2000年3月訂的四年計劃什么時候結束的
And in March of 2000, do you know when a four-year plan ended?
2000年4月
April of 2000.
得趕快行動
We gotta move, now.
不能把所有的寶
We can't put all of our eggs
都押在風雨之后見彩虹這種愿景上
in the pot-of-gold-at-the-end-of-the-rainbow basket.
彩虹里有寶嗎
So, the-- the pot of gold is in the basket?
理查德  這些是世上最好的銷售人員
Richard, these are the best salespeople in the world,
他們告訴我面向企業是正確的
and when they tell me that business-facing is the play,
我得聽他們的
I gotta listen to that, okay?
-有道理  但是  -我只是要你跟你的人說說
- That's fair, but it's-- - I'm just asking you to talk to your guys
把平臺轉為面向企業
about modifying your platform for enterprise.
看看什么樣  行嗎
I mean, just-- just see how it feels, okay?
不管發生什么
And no matter what happens,
我保證
I promise you this:
我永遠不會危害到產品
I will never compromise the product.
好吧  好吧
Okay. Okay.
好吧  我跟我的人說說
Fine, I will talk to my guys,
但他們應該不會開心
but they're not gonna be happy about it.
當然不會開心  他們是工程師
No, of course not. They're engineers.
回頭見了
I'll see you later.
我發現這是日本的傳統  但你是中國人
I realize this is a Japanese tradition and that you are Chinese.
我不是種族歧視
I'm not racist.
對  日本人種族歧視
Yes, Japanese people racist.
-他們太壞了  -不不不
- They are horrible. - No. No, no.
楊靖  每段關系
Jian-Yang, in every relationship,
都有起落  有波動
there are ebbs and flows.
-起落  -對
- Ebbs? - Yes.
我們雖然有過波動
And although we have flowed,
但我們的關系
our relationship now
已經永遠地落幕了
has come to a permanent ebbing.
波動
Flow.
不  不
No. No.
是永遠地落幕
We have come to a permanent ebb.
你明白嗎
Do you understand?
你想讓我走嗎
So, you want me to leave the house?
對  對  非常想
Yes. Yes. Very much so.
因此  我感謝你
And so, I thank you...
帶來的今天
for our today.
該你鞠躬了
Now you bow.
鞠躬
Bow.
折個直角
All the way to the waist.
不要
N-no.
-好吧  -謝謝  埃里希
- Okay. - Thank you, Elrich.
再見  小家伙
Goodbye, little one.
我會想你的
I'm gonna miss you.
這段經歷真還不錯  楊靖
Can't say it wasn't fun, Jian-Yang...
你個廣東小混蛋
you little Cantonese bastard.
-你喜歡這樣嗎  -你干什么
- Hey, you like this? - What are you doing?
你好  我是埃里希·巴赫曼
Hi, my name's Erlich Bachman.
我是個騙人精
I'm a lying fuck!
誰  你沖誰喊呢
Who-- who are you yelling at?
這里就我們倆啊
We're the only two people in the fucking house!
埃里希騙子
Erlich a liar!
你也不會改變我對自己的看法的
You're not gonna get me to change my opinion about myself.
-騙子  -快拿走
- Liar! - Take that outta there!
我也不清楚  理查德  沒那么大關系吧
I don't know, Richard. I don't think it's that big a deal.
真的嗎  先面向企業你沒意見嗎
Really, you don't? You're okay with being business first?
我們說的算的話  應該不會這么做
Granted, it's not what we would do if we were in charge,
但杰克好像挺懂行的
but Jack seems to know what he's doing.
太他媽神奇了
This is fucking amazing.
感覺像是在《少數派報告》里
I feel like I'm in "Minority Report."
你在現實里就是少數派
And in reality, you're just a minority.
理查德  放松  神經網絡還是要構建的
Richard, relax. We're still building the neural net.
厲害的事我們也都要做的
We still get to do all the cool stuff, right?
是啊
Yeah, of course.
不會舍棄點對點服務吧
We're not scrapping any peer-to-peer delivery?
當然不會
No, no, definitely not.
做的事情都一樣  只是順序變了
So, we're still doing the same stuff, just in a different order.
你說的沒錯
Yeah, I guess you're right.
已經正式開始驅逐房客了
Well, the eviction process is officially underway,
但我的律師說可能得花上一年
but my attorney says it may take up to a year.
-那這一年你住哪兒  -我有辦法
- Where are you gonna stay? - Well, I always have my trick.
好吧我來接  你有什么辦法
All right, I'll bite. What's your trick?
我就把我的骨架看作是我
I simply imagine that my skeleton is me,
我的身體就是我的家
and my body is my house,
這樣我就一直待在家里了
and that way, I'm always home.
好吧
Okay. Well...
不知道你們聽說了沒  我們面向企業了
we are now business-facing. I don't know if you heard.
意味著我們要重寫所有架構
That means we have to rewrite our entire deck.
我只希望這別拖我們后腿
I just hope it doesn't put us way the fuck behind.
能拖到哪  '尾幀'爛透了
Behind who? EndFrame sucks
'紐核力'一出手就砸了
and Nucleus shit the bed, remember?
你說得對  說得對
Yeah, yeah. You're right, you're right.
這簡直沒完了
This is endless.
我們當時要是為"紐核力"這么努力
If we worked this hard on Nucleus in the first place,
或許就不會淪為今天這個樣子了
we probably wouldn't be scrubbing it right now.
-你已經寫完了  -是啊
- Dude, are you done? - Yup.
那么多字符串你怎么處理完的
How'd you script digest all those strings so fast?
我就用了個預測循環
I don't know. It's just a predictive loop.
其實像是樹狀支線合集
Actually, it's sort of like a context tree.
見鬼
Holy shit.
怎么了
What's up?
賈里德  我們今晚就到這兒吧
Hey, Jared, why don't we knock off for tonight?
明早再繼續吧
Just pick this back up tomorrow morning?
同意
Agreed.
我已經快四十小時沒睡過好覺了
I'm going on close to 40 hours without good sleep,
現在看東西已經開始飄忽了
and the edges of things are starting to get a little dancey.
什么
What?
埃利希  再次感謝你讓我住進了
Erlich, thank you again for allowing me to occupy
你舒適車庫的角落
a corner of your cozy garage.
那就是我的家了
It is my hearth and my home.
搞什么
What the fuck?
天啊  楊靖
Jian-Yang, Jesus Christ,
別偷偷溜到別人背后  你個小混蛋
don't sneak up on people like that, you devious little bastard,
特別是在洗玻璃器具的時候
especially if they're cleaning glassware.
你把我趕走  卻讓他住進來了
You kick me out, but you let him stay.
他都不是被孵人
He's not even an incubee.
他確實不是  所以他沒住進房子里
No, he's not, and he's not staying in the house.
像一堆盆栽土一樣住在車庫里
He's in the garage, like a sad bag of potting soil.
有點同情心
Have some compassion.
他把他家租給了
I mean, the guy rented his place
一個賴著不走的房客
to some fuckhead tenant who won't leave.
賈里德特別慘  楊靖
Jared is fucked, Jian-Yang.
他可以報警
He can go to the police.
沒用  加州法律沒給房東任何追索權
It's useless. California law gives landlords literally no recourse.
那他可以起訴
So, he can go to court.
他當然要起訴了  四眼小田雞
Of course, he's going to go to court, you four-eyed turd.
但在美國  司法系統沒啥效率
But in America, the legal system doesn't work very well,
所以至少得等上一年
so it will take at least a year
才能等到正式開始處理
for the proceedings to even begin.
懂了嗎
Do you understand that?
懂了  我能在這里待一年
Yes. I stay here for one year.
不用付房租
I pay no rent.
你沒有追索權
You have no recourse.
我說的也不絕對
That's not always the case.
有時候庭審進程能加快進行
I mean, sometimes court systems can move faster,
-尤其是你有錢  -我要在房間里抽煙
- especially if you have money for-- - I'm going to smoke in my room.
-見鬼  -特殊情況
- Oh. Mother fuck. - Special occasion.
如果我們把相同的循環加在從亨德里克斯那里
If we stack that same loop on top of the bit-level encoder
拿來的比特級編碼器開頭
that we took from Hendricks,
然后套用進我們一直想用的這套進程
and then we tethered it to the routine we were trying to use--
那樣就大幅提高速度了
That would be a huge jump in speed.
太厲害了
This is mega.
亨德里克斯在科技博客做的就是這個
This is what Hendricks did at Tech Crunch Disrupt.
我們破解了發散法
I think we just cracked middle-out.
我們應該告訴蓋文吧
We should probably tell Gavin, right?
為什么  他炒了我們
Why? He fired us.
你知道要是我們帶著這個算法
You know how much we could get paid
去別家能拿到多少錢嗎
if we took this somewhere else?
走開
Fuck off.
我捋一下
Okay, let me get this straight.
你們先是讓我轉型  面向企業
First you talked me into going business-facing,
現在又想讓我從平臺中
and now you want to eliminate
整個拿掉神經網絡
the entire neural net from the platform?
簡  電話銷售部經理  人稱"犀利簡"
Jan, Director, Inside Sales. They call me "Jan the Man."
我知道你是"犀利簡"
Yes, we know, "Jan the Man."
我們得留著神經網絡進行深度學習
Listen, we have to do neural net for deep learning.
系統處理過足夠多的數據流
Look, once we get enough data flowing through the system,
它就能識別出更宏大的模式
it will be able to recognize long-range patterns
真正地學習
and actually learn.
它能自己優化我們的算法
It will be able to optimize our algorithm on its own,
改進我們已經領先的速度和效率
increasing our already superior speed and efficiency.
很厲害吧
Right? Pretty cool, huh?
但要是刪了就做不到這些了
But it won't be able to do that if we delete it.
-懂嗎  -當你剛剛也說了
- Do you get that? - But you just said it.
它需要集中儲存數據  對吧
It requires a central repository of data, right?
企業都想保護自己的數據
Businesses want to protect their data.
一提到安全它們就慫得不行
They're huge pussies when it comes to security.
我們不能砍掉學習機制  不行
Okay, well, we're not cutting machine learning. We're not.
要是砍了它  不如把點對點傳輸
If we cut that, we might as well cut peer-to-peer delivery,
還有云端所有功能都砍了吧
and all the efficiencies of the cloud.
這些功能還在嗎
Are those still in?
這些也不能留
No, those have to go also.
-什么  -我叫基斯
- What? - Keith, by the way.
我知道你叫什么  你們叫什么我都知道
I know your name, okay? I know everybody's name.
聽著
Look...
我們不能因為你們不好賣
we can't cut everything about this platform
就把產品里革命性的功能
that makes it revolutionary just because that's
全都拿掉  懂嗎
a little harder for you guys to sell, all right?
要是想賣  就打包一起賣唄
If we want to sell out, let's just sell all the way out.
拿了算法  塞進個金屬箱子
Let's just take the algorithm, jam it into a metal fucking box,
扔到哪個數據中心去
stick it in the back of a data center somewhere,
讓它與世隔絕
so it can't connect to anything,
讓誰都不知道有這么個東西
and it just sits there and no one even knows it's there.
道格  還是跟著基斯見習的
Doug, still shadowing Keith.
你說的"金屬箱子"是指
When you say "Metal box," You're talking
放服務器的那種機架嗎
about a rack-mounted server-type appliance?
不是
No, no, no.
我只是用它比喻一個爛主意
I am using it as a rhetorical example of a bad idea.
也太蠢了吧
That's fucking stupid.
我了個老天爺
Oh my God.
我得找杰克談談  稍等
I just need to find Jack. One second.
-杰克在哪  -他得去見他的獸醫
- Where's Jack? - He had to go meet his vet.
獸醫  上著班去見獸醫
His vet? In the middle of the day?
那好吧  你有獸醫的地址嗎
Okay, well, what's the vet's address?
杰克  不好意思  你能不能告訴我...
Jack, excuse me. Do you mind telling me--
我的天  那是個啥  我的天啊
Holy shit. What is that? Oh, mother of God.
理查德  你怎么來了
Richard, what are you doing here?
什么意思  現在才兩點半  你怎么在這
What do you mean? It's 2:30. What are you doing here?
我的頭號良種母馬正在發情
My number one breeding mare went into heat.
抱歉  她比較隨性
Sorry, she's not much for schedules.
我的天
Oh God.
這可是純種馬  理查德
Thoroughbreds, Richard.
僅限自然育種
Natural cover only.
這種事可不常見  是吧
Now, you don't see that very often, do you?
的確
Nope.
剛才在會上...
I had a meeting--
剛才在會上我聽銷售人員
I had a meeting with the sales guys
和犀利簡說...
and Jan the Man...
那個什么  咱們能不能去那邊聊
You know what? Can we talk over here?
我實在是看不下去了
This is just hard for me.
是這樣  杰克  我對你有點意見
Look, Jack, you and I have a problem.
你那幫干營銷的告訴我
Okay, your salespeople are telling me
把這個平臺上所有厲害的東西都刪掉
to cut everything cool about the platform
就因為他們推銷時候有點困難
just because it's a little bit harder for them to sell.
但他們既然干營銷這么厲害
But don't you think because they are such amazing salespeople
難道不應該迎難而上嗎
that it would be okay for them to sell the harder stuff?
不  營銷不是這么干的
No. It doesn't work that way.
你要是想留住一支優秀的營銷團隊
The way you keep the best salespeople is,
就得給他們提供容易推銷的產品
you need to give 'em something easy to sell.
否則他們就會另謀高就了
Otherwise, they'd just go somewhere else.
說實話  '魔笛手'將來會成為全球標準
Okay, well, Pied Piper could honestly be the global standard
統治文件壓縮儲存領域
for file compression and storage.
全世界任何一臺移動設備
Every mobile device on the face of the planet
都可以隨意訪問他們的數據
could be able to access their data
就仿佛連著一根光纖一般
as if they had a fiber optic cable plugged into it.
無論是身處荒漠還是難民營
People in the desert, people in refugee camps,
一無所有的人都可以一夜間連接海量數據
people who have nothing could suddenly have access to everything.
我們這個行業里
You know, everybody in this industry,
大家都在說想讓世界變得更好
they say they want to make this world a better place,
而我們真的可以做到這一點
but we could actually do it.
同時我們還能掙得盆滿缽滿
We could do it and make billions of dollars.
理查德  你聽我說
Richard, listen--
不  你聽我說  杰克
No, you listen to me, Jack.
你向我保證過不會損害產品
You promised me that you would never compromise the product.
所以  你覺得要不要
So, do you feel like
站出來表個態支持我一下
taking some action and backing me up on this,
因為我和我的產品
because me and my product
感覺都他媽被損害了
feel pretty fucking compromised right now.
理查德  我覺得你還不明白產品到底是什么
Richard, I don't think you understand what the product is.
你的平臺并不是產品
The product isn't the platform,
你的算法也不是產品
and the product isn't your algorithm, either.
甚至你的軟件都不是產品
And it's not even the software.
你知道'魔笛手'的產品到底是什么嗎
Do you know what Pied Piper's product is, Richard?
難道
Is...
難道是我嗎
Is it me?
我的天  當然不是
Oh God! No!
不是的  怎么可能是你
No. How could it possibly be you?
你害得自己被開了
You got fired.
'魔笛手'的產品是它的股票
Pied Piper's product is its stock.
股票
Its stock?
什么能讓股價上漲
And whatever makes the value of that stock go up,
我們就做什么
that is what we are going to make.
也許在未來的什么時候
And maybe sometime in the future,
我們會改變世界  創造奇跡
we could change the world and perform miracles,
這個那個的好事  我也希望如此
and all of that stuff, and I hope we do.
不過正如我之前說過的
But, like I told you before,
我絕不會為此賭上當下
I'm not going to mortgage the present for that.
我現在就要見效益
I need to move the needle today.
不好意思  失陪一下
And now, if you will excuse me.
我花了15萬
I paid $150,000
買那匹種馬馬上就要射出來的精華
for the semen that's about to come out of that stallion,
而我非常想在現場親眼見證那一刻
and I would very much like to be there to see that it happens.
理查德
Oh! Hey, Richard!
-怎么了  -東北區的基斯剛給我發了條短信
- Yes? - I just got a text from Keith, Northeast Regional.
他說大家喜歡你的點子
He says the guys love your idea.
什么點子
What idea?
這個世界很大
It's a big world,
但有了現代科技
but thanks to modern technology,
世界變得非常小
it's smaller than ever.
今天的商業瞬息萬變
Today, business moves at the speed of light.
你可以隨時隨地訪問你公司的數據
You can access your company's data anywhere, anytime.
但是既然你可以訪問
But if you can get your data,
別人可不可以
who else can get it?
間諜  小偷  罪犯  和外國人
Spies, thieves, criminals, and foreigners.
如果我們可以
What if there was a way
將你公司的所有數據
to take all of your company's data
全部備份到一個防護嚴密
and back it up in a protected enclosure
與世隔絕的安全空間
completely isolated from the world at large?
糟了
Oh no.
企業數據存儲的終極解決方案
The ultimate enterprise data storage solution.
回歸方寸之間
'魔笛手'出品
這才像那么回事
Now that's what I'm talking about.
這才是我們要做的產品  各位
This is the game we're playing, team,
出擊吧
so let's win it!
哥幾個  快看看
You guys, check it out.
艾米大廚掏空了個西瓜
Chef Amy hollowed out a watermelon
然后填滿了西瓜果凍
and filled it with watermelon jello!
你們看  這是真的西瓜皮
Look, that's actual rind.
那是什么鬼  錄像機嗎
The fuck is that? Is that a VCR?
上面怎么還有'魔笛手'的標志
Why does it say "Pied Piper" on it?
大家怎么這么樂呵
Why is everybody so happy?
