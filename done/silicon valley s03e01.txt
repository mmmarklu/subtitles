我剛被炒了
I just got fired.
那我呢
And what about me?
關你什么事
What about you?
我可怎么辦啊
What about me?
好吧  就這樣吧
Okay. That's it.
我他媽的現在就出門
I'm going over there right fucking now,
他們走之前到
before they leave.
埃利希  我得開你的車
Erlich, I'm gonna use your car.
賈里德  給羅恩·拉弗蘭梅打電話讓他在那見我
Jared, you call Ron LaFlamme, tell him to meet me there.
這幫狗娘養的混蛋
Fuck these assholes!
等下  理查德  我跟你一起去
Wait. Richard, I'm coming with you.
來  賈里德  收拾收拾
Here. Jared, clear this.
把煙都搞出去
Get all the smoke out of it.
不然該把儀器弄壞了
Otherwise, it damages the device.
別跟個娘們似的
Don't be a pussy.
他們怎么能這樣呢
How could they do this?
怎么能把我從我自己的公司炒了呢
How could they fire me from my own company?
冷靜點  我們會反抗的
Just stay calm. We're gonna fight this.
神啊  理查德  慢點
Jesus, Richard, slow down.
停停停
Stop, stop, stop!
我撞到鹿了嗎
Did I just hit a deer?
沒有  偶滴神
No, goddamn it!
是殺千刀的斯坦福機器人隊
Fucking Stanford Robotics.
操  那我們是不是要遲到了
Shit. Is this gonna make us late?
他們把公鹿機器人撞死了
They killed the Bam-bot.
去你媽的公鹿機器人
Fuck your Bam-bot!
你們這群斯坦福小婊子把老子的格柵給弄壞了
You little Stanford cunts fucked up my grille!
真他媽不是好貨  等等
Fucking piece of shit! Wait.
你個小賤人
You little cunt!
臥槽
Fuck!
這是送你老娘的
This one's for your mama.
埃利希別說了  埃利希  我們得趕去"拉維加"
Erlich, stop. Come on. Erlich, we've got to get to Raviga.
別這樣
Hey, no, no.
謝謝你能來  羅恩
Thanks for coming, Ron.
我隨時可以為你逃掉動感單車課  理奇
I'd bail on spin class any day for you, Richie.
理查德  理查德
Richard. Richard.
我一直給你打電話你都沒接
I kept calling, you weren't answering.
跟爪子解釋吧  莫妮卡
Talk to the hand, Monica.
理查德  你能停下嗎  我能解釋
Richard, can you stop? I can explain, okay?
不言自明  莫妮卡  你投票同意炒了我
It's pretty self-explanatory, Monica. You voted to fire me.
搞什么啊
What the fuck?
我才不會讓你們把我趕出去呢
I mean, there is no way I'm letting you push me out of this.
我們的本意不是把你趕出去
Our intention is not to push you out.
我們希望能讓你轉入一個
We wish rather to transition you
更適合你的角色
to a more appropriate role within the company.
一個新的首席執行官回來負責公司的運行
A new CEO will be brought in to manage day-to-day operations
而你則是首席技術官
while you assume the role of Chief Technology Officer.
恭喜你
Congratulations.
-首席技術官  -對
- CTO? - Yes.
你打算讓我給我自己的公司打工
You want me to be an employee at my own company?
依然由你負責工程部分
You would still be in charge of the engineering,
你可以保留你的期權  繼續留在董事會
and you'd continue vesting your shares, and keep your board seat.
你是說那個一小時前投票解雇我的董事會嗎
The same seat I had an hour ago when you voted to fire me as CEO?
-還真方便啊  -理查德  別這樣
- That came in handy. - Richard, please.
我知道這事苦甜摻半  但今早
I realize this may be bittersweet, but earlier this evening
"拉維加"決定出資五百萬投資魔笛手系列A期
Raviga decided to officially fund Pied Piper Series A Round
價值五千萬
at $5 million at a $50 million valuation.
中心思想就是  你創建的公司
Essentially, you have created
對于你來說太有價值了你管不了了
a company that is too valuable for you to run.
你應該為自己自豪才對
You should feel good about that.
你是在搞笑嗎  是我創建了這個公司
Are you kidding me? I made the company, okay?
是我想到了魔笛手這個名字
I'm the one who came up with the name "Pied Piper."
對
Yeah.
羅恩  我能私下跟你說句話嗎
Ron, can I have a word please?
他們不能這樣對我吧
They can't really do this, can they?
他們已經這樣對你了
I think they just did.
你還記得你跟漢納曼搞的那個爛買賣嗎
You remember that shit deal you brought me from Hanneman,
我跟你說"理奇  這可是個爛買賣"
and I said, "Hey, Richie, this is a shit deal,"
但你還是干了
but you took it anyway
因為你想在有限人生中瘋狂一次
because you wanted to do something crazy for once in your life?
對  我記得
Yes, I remember.
你基本上就是給槍上了膛遞給了漢納曼
Well, you basically just loaded a gun and handed it to Hanneman,
漢納曼轉身又把槍賣給了拉維加
and Hanneman sold that gun to Raviga,
然后拉維加用槍桿子揍了你一頓
and then Raviga just fucking pistol-whipped you.
但至少他們讓你保期權
But hey, at least they're letting you keep your shares
還讓你留在董事會
and your board seat.
你可能會損失點期權給新的首席執行官
You lose a little blood with the dilution
但我見過更慘的
for the new CEO, but I've seen worse.
比如你跟漢納曼搞的那破買賣
Like that shit deal you brought me from Hanneman.
只要給理查德一點空間
If we give Richard a little bit of space,
他是可以逐漸接受現實的
he'll be able to wrap his head around this,
這樣新首席執行官就能平穩上任
and a smooth transition to a new CEO will be possible.
我曾擔任'亞威亞托'首席執行官...
To wit, I served as the CEO of Aviat--
巴赫曼先生
Mr. Bachman.
在我參與投資的'魔笛手'公司里
In the version of Pied Piper in which I am invested,
你現在不會是首席執行官  永遠也不會
you will not be CEO. Not now. Not ever.
女士  您可真是頂級悍婦啊
Well, you, madam, are a shrew of the first order.
聽著  我不會坐以待斃的
Okay. I'm not gonna let you do this.
我要反抗
I'm gonna fight it.
我理解你很生氣
I understand you're upset.
大家也看得出  我的情緒也很激動
As you can see, this is a very emotional time for me as well,
但參與競爭首席執行官席位的候選人
but we have some very strong candidates
不少都非常有競爭力
coming in for the CEO position,
我們很期待能聽到你的意見
and we would so appreciate your input.
我的意見
My input?
你想讓我幫你們挑人來頂替我嗎
You want me to help you pick my new replacement?
那我還不如辭職算了
I'd rather quit.
損失多少錢我都不在乎了
And I don't care how much money I lose,
反正等我告你們個底朝天
because I am gonna get it all back
我都能賺回來
when I sue the living shit out of you!
好吧  算了  算了
Okay. All right. All right.
羅恩  走了
Ron, let's go.
抱歉  我必須告知您
Sorry, I'm forced to inform you
我將無法繼續為您提供法律咨詢服務
that I can no longer provide you with legal counsel.
你這是什么意思  你是我的律師
What are you talking about? You're my attorney.
不  理論上講  我是'魔笛手'的企業律師
No. Technically, I'm Pied Piper's corporate counsel,
而你剛宣布了辭職意向
and you just declared your intention to walk.
所以實質上  你算是威脅要起訴我了
So, in effect, you kind of just threatened to sue me,
而我不怎么喜歡被威脅  亨德里克斯先生
and I don't take kindly to threats, Mr. Hendricks.
亨德里克斯先生
"Mr. Hendricks"?
不叫我'理奇'了
What happened to "Richie"?
抱歉  我也不能與你
Unfortunately, I'm not at liberty to discuss him
談論他  亨德里克斯先生
with you either, Mr. Hendricks.
理查德  如果我不投票開除你
Richard, if I didn't vote to remove you,
勞里只會暫停會議
then Laurie would've adjourned the meeting,
在'拉維加'隨便找個人替我當董事
replaced my seat on the board with someone else at Raviga,
然后他們一樣會投票開除你
and then they would've voted to remove you.
至少這樣我還在內部
At least this way, I'm still in the game.
你是想說  這樣你還有工作吧
No. You mean, at least this way, you kept your job.
猶太背叛自己領導  背叛耶穌的時候
At least the actual Judas had the courtesy to kill himself
至少他還懂得自殺
after betraying his leader, Jesus Christ.
全世界的首席執行官  聽說過嗎
He's the CEO of the world. Ever heard of him?
懂  我讀的天主教學校
Yeah. Got it. Went to Catholic school.
是嗎  讀了多久
Really? How long?
聽我說  我還是公司的董事
Look, I'm still on the board of this company.
我還會參加全部會議
I'll be in all of the meetings.
也許什么時候就能幫上忙
Maybe I can be helpful at some point.
想幫忙嗎  莫妮卡
You wanna be helpful, Monica?
說服勞里讓我繼續做首席執行官
Convince Laurie to keep me on as CEO.
我知道我犯過錯  人無完人
Look, I know I made some mistakes. I wasn't perfect,
但我會改進的  哪怕像'推特'那家伙一樣
but I'll get better. I'll even go to one of those CEO coaches,
找個什么首席執行官教練
like that guy at fucking Twitter.
理查德  沒用的
Richard, it's done.
勞里已經找到新首席執行官了
Laurie already found a new CEO.
什么  這么快
What? Already?
你說你不想參與面試
You said that you didn't want to be part of the interview process,
所以他們今早就定了人選
so they picked someone this morning.
杰克·巴克  是位極老練的頂級首席執行官
Jack Barker. He's an incredibly skilled, top-notch CEO.
我才不管他是誰  沒人在乎
I don't care who he is, okay? None of us do.
杰克·巴克
行動者杰克·巴克
杰克·巴克凈身價
杰克·巴克抗癌基金
杰克·巴克'企融系統'
杰克·巴克'轉角遇到線'
行動者杰克·巴克
"Action" Jack Barker?
開玩笑嗎  居然不要我要那個白毛老骨頭
Seriously? They picked that gray-haired fossil over me?
不是說你拒了他們嗎
You said you turned the job down.
我說的是  我們互相沒看上
I said it was mutual.
怎么了  這形容挺準確的
What? That's accurate.
他管理過'企融系統'
He ran Entercross Systems.
1998年首次公開募股超過十億美元
They IPO'ed in 1998 for more than a billion dollars.
是嗎  那他媽都20年前了
Yeah, 20 fucking years ago.
那是科技圈1.0  最近呢
Tech 1.0. What has he done lately?
之后管理'轉角遇到線'四年
After that, he ran Turnwire for four years
直到公司以20億被微軟收購
until it was acquired by Microsoft for $2 billion.
老天爺  這家伙了不得
Holy shit. This guy's a hitter.
那也是20世紀前十年  中期他做什么去了
He was, in the oughts. What's he done in the 20-teens?
看起來他以他母親的名義
Looks like he started a foundation
發起了一個基金會  目的是治療癌癥
in his mother's name to cure cancer.
后來情況如何
Yeah, how's that going?
他媽肯定死了
Yeah. I bet his mother's dead.
是  正因此他才成立基金會的吧
Yeah, that's probably why he started the foundation.
理查德  勞里明天就跟他見面了
Richard, Laurie's meeting with him tomorrow.
你應該一起去跟他談談
You should come in and talk with him.
門都沒有
No fucking way.
你好好想想  你要知道
Think this through. I mean, you have to know
你無法再創建一家壓縮算法公司了
that you can't start another compression company.
不會有風投人冒著被起訴風險去投資
No VC will fund that out of fear of being sued,
除非你想到了完全與眾不同
and unless you have some totally different,
扭轉乾坤的點子
game-changing idea lying around--
你是說如果我走我就完蛋了嗎
So you're saying that I'm fucked if I leave?
不  我是說...
No, I'm saying that--
好吧  那我就算完蛋了
Okay. Well, then I guess I'm fucked,
因為我走定了
because I'm out.
我走的話賈里德也走  迪尼希和吉爾弗約爾都走
And when I leave, Jared's out, Dinesh is out, Gilfoyle is out.
所有人都走了
Everybody's out.
所以祝你在公司里好運  莫妮卡
So good luck with the company there, Monica.
就只剩下你  勞里·布里姆
It'll just be you, Laurie Bream,
還有個癌癥都治不好的混蛋了
and some fucking asshole who can't even cure cancer.
他說得對
He's right.
理查德去哪里我就去哪里
Where Richard goes, I go.
莫妮卡  原諒我現在有點嗨
Monica, excuse how high I am,
但天主教學校里的人
but are the uniforms in
跟他們在網上一樣那么低級趣味嗎
Catholic schools as low-cut as they are online?
滾
Fuck off.
你告訴理查德你走了嗎
Did you tell Richard you were out?
沒有  你呢
No. Did you?
沒有
No.
我們走嗎
Are we out?
蓋文告訴你是什么事了嗎
Did Gavin tell you what this is about?
我們很久沒說話了
We haven't spoken in some time.
事出緊急  感謝大家前來
Thank you all for coming on such short notice.
我要發表一個艱難的聲明
I have a difficult announcement to make.
我們做技術的通常認為失敗是好事
We, in the tech business, often refer to failure as a good thing.
失敗是成長
Failure is growth.
失敗是學習
Failure is learning.
但有時失敗就是失敗
But sometimes failure is just failure.
我認為...
I think...
抱歉
I'm sorry.
我沒想到會這么難
I didn't think it would be this hard.
但是再見總是很難
But goodbyes are always hard,
尤其說再見的那個人是我
especially when I am the one saying goodbye.
今天  立即生效
Today, effective immediately,
我蓋文·貝爾森  互利的創始人兼首席執行官
I, Gavin Belson, founder and CEO of Hooli,
被迫跟紐核力部門的所有人再見
am forced to officially say goodbye to the entire Nucleus division.
紐核力所有員工都會收到正式解約通知
All Nucleus personnel will be given proper notice and terminated.
但大家不要搞錯了
But make no mistake.
盡管走的是他們
Though they're the ones leaving,
但是我必須
it is I who must remain
承受他們失敗的重擔
and bear the heavy burden of their failure.
是我的錯
It is my fault.
我信任了他們能完成工作
I trusted them to get the job done.
但這就是領導的代價
But that is the price of leadership.
謝謝
Thank you.
我第一次見這么勇敢的行為
That was the gutsiest thing I've ever seen.
令人驚嘆
Amazing.
慢著  這是說...
So, wait, does that mean...
丹波克
Uh... Denpok?
我能喝你的大杯飲料嗎
Can I have your Big Gulp?
我知道我們一直這么說
I know we keep saying this,
但即便理查德是個好人
but even though Richard is a great guy...
才華橫溢的碼農
And a brilliant coder.
他很厲害
He's wonderful.
但是  他有點缺乏...
Nevertheless, he is lacking in certain...
管理能力
managerial capacities.
-說得對  -對吧
- Totally fair. - It's fair, right?
他仍然是個很棒的碼農
He's still a great coder.
而且是個很棒的人
And an amazing human being.
-好了  聽著  -真的...
- Okay, look. - Such...
我們有很多關于他的話想說
We have a lot of shit we want to say about him.
但是非得這么冠冕堂皇地夸他嗎
Do we have to keep prefacing it with all this nice-guy stuff?
如果要這樣  我們要在這里待一整晚了
I mean, if so, we're gonna be here all night.
其實是要夸夸他的
Yeah, we kind of do, though,
這樣才能抵消他做的那些破事
just to offset the shittiness of all the shitty stuff.
我們用字典補丁式方法來說怎么樣
What if we use like a dictionary patch?
把這些夸他的話壓縮起來
To compress all the nice-guy stuff.
變成縮寫那樣
Like an acronym.
沒錯
Exactly.
理查德人很好  但是
"Richard is great, but you know"...
理-人-好-但
R-I-g-b-y.
理人好但
Rigby.
理人好但就代表了所有夸他的話
Rigby is all the nice-guy stuff.
好  理人好但
Okay. Rigby.
他就假定我們會跟他一起走
But he just assumed we were gonna leave with him,
這根本就是扯淡啊
which is kind of total bullshit, right?
太目中無人了
That's really arrogant.
理人好但  我們放棄了自己的應用
Rigby. We gave up our own apps...
就為了能為他赴湯蹈火
so that we could bust our asses for him.
我們憑啥要在被風投看上的關口
Why the fuck should we give up our Pied Piper shares
放棄自己在魔笛手的期權
right when we get funded
全怪他自己腦子進水
because he's too much of a prima donna
不想讓個更有經驗的人
to let someone experienced come in
來正確地管理公司
and run the company the way its supposed to be run.
理人好但  理人好但
Rigby. Rigby.
我現在真的是要氣瘋了
Now I'm actually getting kind of fucking angry!
我們一分錢不拿地拼命
I mean, we put in so much work for no pay,
他現在以為可以一走了之嗎
and now he thinks he's gonna walk out on us?
說真的  讓他自己玩蛋去吧
I mean, seriously, fuck that guy.
去他媽的  理人好但
Fuck him. Rigby.
我們要怎么辦
What are we gonna do?
理人好但  理人好但
Rigby. Rigby.
理查德  我給你帶了個逗你開心的東西
Richard, I have something that might cheer you up.
這是啥
What is this?
來  郁悶小哥  打開看看
Go on, Gloomy Gus, open it.
好
Okay.
這是一箱子各種公司的信息文件嗎
So this is a box of files with companies' information on it?
不  這是所有
No. These are all companies
我自作主張聯系過的
that I took the liberty of reaching out to
并愿意請你出任首席技術官的公司
that are actually offering you the job of CTO.
真的嗎
Really?
其中有些還不錯
Some of these companies are pretty good.
“震顫光線”是真心不錯
Flutterbeam's like... really good.
當然了  他們都很好
Of course it is. They all are.
你可是個大人物
You're the belle of the ball,
這些都是你的追隨者
and these are all your swains,
希望能得到你的垂青
hoping for a glimpse of ankle.
字幕
The nest wherein the asp doth coil.
理查德人呢  他來嗎
Where's Richard? Is he coming?
不來
Nope.
恭喜你  你成功打垮了一個好人
Congratulations, you've successfully broken a good man.
那就是巴克嗎
Is that Barker?
對
Uh... yeah.
你打算怎么辦
What are you gonna do?
《修士調侃》: 以善意調侃一位名人為表演形式的喜劇演出
我剛剛花了十六個小時在《修士調侃》上
I just spent the last 16 hours cherry-picking Friars Roasts
搜索頂級老人笑話
for the premium old-man jokes.
說到底  我想用他的鈦合金假髖骨
Essentially, I'm going to beat him to death
把他打死
with his own titanium hips.
不光是為了我  也是為了理查德
Not just for me, but for Richard.
杰克·巴克  又叫行動者巴克
Jack Barker, aka Action Jack.
我們終于見面了
We meet at last.
埃利希·巴赫曼
Erlich Bachman.
巴赫曼先生
Mr. Bachman.
很高興終于見到你了
Pleasure to finally meet you.
我是大粉絲
I'm a big fan.
真的嗎  是啥的粉絲  美達施保健品的粉
Oh, really? Of what? Metamucil?
小兒麻痹還是留聲機的粉
Polio? The phonograph?
一條好魚的粉絲
A nice piece of fish?
隔離飲水機的粉絲
Segregated water fountains?
珀金斯家庭餐廳老年折扣的粉絲
Senior citizen discounts at Perkins Family restaurants?
睪丸動脈萎縮導致的陽痿的粉絲
Erectile dysfunction because of corroded penile arteries?
用魔鬼蛋做正餐的粉絲
Deviled eggs as an entree?
還是《喜歡艾克》的粉絲
Liking Ike?
不
No.
都不是  巴赫曼先生
None of those, Mr. Bachman.
我是你的粉絲
I am a fan of yours.
自你掌管亞威亞托起就是了
Have been ever since you were at the helm of Aviato.
你知道亞威亞托
You know Aviato?
對  亞威亞托
Yes. Aviato.
我的亞威亞托
My Aviato?
還有別的公司叫亞威亞托嗎
Is there any other Aviato?
法律上來講  不可能有
Well, legally, there cannot be.
巴克先生  很高興認識你
Mr. Barker, pleasure to meet you.
-那是亞麻籽松餅嗎  -是的
- Is that a poppy seed muffin? - Yes, sir.
媽媽吃過了  老爹也想來一個
Well, Poppy wants one 'cause Mommy already got hers.
互利股價大漲7%
消息稱蓋文·貝爾森減記了
Hooli stock jumped seven percent today
整個'紐核力'項目資產賬面價值
on this news that Gavin Belson is writing down
互利股價今日因此大漲7%
the entire Nucleus project.
究竟發生了什么
What's happening here?
這是個大膽的舉動
It was a courageous move.
他是個直腸子
He's a straight shooter,
很顯然  華爾街也對此做出了回應
and obviously Wall Street is responding to that.
你還有什么想法
So, what else do you think--
根據我們的統計
So, by our account,
互利近半數的聘用協議
just under 50 percent of Hooli employment agreements
包含競業禁止條款
include a non-compete clause.
員工任職時與離職后一定時間內不得供職于競爭對手
正因為這項條款
The same clause that caused us
我們才在仲裁中輸掉了'魔笛手'的訴訟
to lose the Pied Piper lawsuit in arbitration
因此沒有法律效力
and are thus legally invalid,
我們的一些知識產權也遭到了質疑
calling into question some of our IP ownership.
該死  我就怕這個
Shit. I was afraid of that.
但假設一下  這里面也蘊藏著機遇
But hypothetically, this also presents an opportunity.
我們可辭退其中任何人且無需支付遣散費
Any of those people could be dismissed with no severance.
未行權的股票將重新回到公司的期權池中
Any unvested stock would return to the company option pool.
換句話說  我們有權
So, in other words, we have the right
和其中任何人終止協議
to terminate any of those people
不僅沒有任何不良后果
with no repercussions whatsoever,
還能從中獲利
and we'd actually make money?
沒錯
Correct.
我們的年度個人績效評估顯示
You know, our annual individual performance reviews
20%的員工工作不達標
showed a 20 percent incidence of sub-standard work.
基本上每五個互利員工中就有一個
So essentially, one out of every five Hooli team members
應該被裁掉
deserve to be fired.
不好意思  您說什么
Oh, I'm sorry. What?
你緊張嗎
So, are you nervous?
沒有  我感覺還挺好
No, actually. I feel pretty good.
'震顫光線'是我們看過的最好的公司
Flutterbeam was the best company we looked at.
他們技術很棒  待遇也很誘人
Their tech is great. Their offer is amazing.
我其實已經有點激動了
Actually, I'm kind of pumped.
你這一激動搞得我也激動了
Well, your pumpedness makes me pumped.
你這兒  好了
You just got-- okay.
-我來  -好的
- I'll do it. - Yeah.
好  賈里德
All right. Well, Jared...
我們有一天的時間來想明白
we gotta one day figure out
你做什么工作
what we're gonna do for you for a job.
理查德  你先去  站穩腳跟
Richard, you'll go. You'll establish yourself,
等有合適的時機  再回來請我
and when the time is right, you'll send for me.
理查德  你必須和這個人聊聊
Richard, you have to talk to this man.
誰啊  巴克  算了
Who, Barker? Pass.
理查德  這家伙真有來頭啊
This guy is real, okay, Richard?
有了他的管理技能
With his managerial skills
再加上你的工程師才能
and your talent as an engineer,
我們現在聊的也許就是D開頭的那個詞啊
we could be talking about the D-word here.
-丁丁  -不  十角獸
- Dick? - No. Decacorn.
一個在首次公開募股前
A company that's valued over $10 billion
估值就突破100億美元的公司
before its initial public offering. All right?
他還會在'拉維加'待一個小時
He's still at Raviga for another hour.
你就去和他談談吧
Please go talk to him.
抱歉  我不能去了
Sorry, I can't do that.
我決定了去'震顫光線'
I'm already set up at Flutterbeam.
那家公司的首席執行官自己說
Whose CEO, unprompted, said,
理查德這樣的頭腦百年一遇
"A brain like Richard's comes along once in a generation."
不好意思  我就是想得瑟一下
Sorry. I'm just proud.
理查德  我不是要你和他抱抱
Richard, I'm not asking you to spoon with the guy
或者插他
or even fork him.
-我只是要你  -那是什么
- What I'm asking for-- - What is that?
"插"就是用你的丁丁和兩腿
Forking is when you use your dick and your two legs
戳他的下半身
to stab him in the lower torso.
我只是要你在拋棄我們的成果之前
I'm asking for you to take 10 minutes and talk to him
花十分鐘時間和他談談
before you throw everything that we built away.
沒錯  我說的是"我們"的成果
And yes, I did say "we."
如果你想去'拉維加'的話
I mean, if you want to stop by Raviga,
去'震顫光線'時順路拜訪就是
it's on the way to Flutterbeam.
我給他丟了重磅炸彈
I mean, I threw some Tyson-level haymakers at this guy.
理查德  他閃都沒閃
Richard, he didn't flinch.
他就像蝴蝶一樣優雅從容
He floats like a butterfly.
理查德
Hey, Richard.
怎么了
What's going on?
-我們剛才在聊天  -好的
- We've been talking. - Okay.
現在真的不合適  理查德
Guys, this isn't really a great time. Richard.
我們想告訴你點事兒
We wanna tell you something. Right?
重要的事情
Yeah, it's something important.
還是遲點說吧  理查德
Maybe later. So, Richard?
你們說吧
Guys, come on.
我們知道你要離開...
We know you're leaving...
-沒錯  我們很清楚  -但是
- Yep. Well aware. - ...but...
-我們不走  -對  我們打算留在"魔笛手"
We're not. Yeah. ...we're gonna stay at Pied Piper.
真的嗎
Really?
你笑什么
Why are you laughing?
抱歉
I'm sorry. Wow.
你們真覺得
Well, it's just that you really think
沒有我你們能夠拓展平臺嗎
that you're gonna be able to scale the platform without me?
見鬼
Goddamn it!
-對  -你覺得我們做不到嗎
- Yeah. - You don't think we can?
我知道你們做不到
Well, I know you can't.
真敢說
That's a bold statement.
-理查德  -我們有很多技術負債
- Richard. - We have massive tech debt.
你們真覺得沒有我  你們可以
You really think that you can scale and deploy my library
拓展使用我的庫嗎
without any input from me?
你們是認真的嗎
Are you serious here?
-當然是  -是的
- Yes, we do. - Yeah.
你們可真是癡心妄想
Then I guess you are truly delusional.
你可真是自大狂
Well, I think you're an arrogant prick.
我自大狂
I'm the arrogant prick.
好吧  公司的代碼代碼都不是你們寫的
Okay. This is coming from two people
還自以為很了解  還說我自大
who think they know everything about code they didn't even write.
我們寫了很多代碼
We wrote a lot of the code.
-只有一點而已  -你猜怎么著  我們就要留下來
- You wrote some of it. - You know what? We're gonna stay,
我們要把'魔笛手'打造好  證明你錯了
and we're gonna build Pied Piper just to prove you wrong.
好吧  謝謝你們的團結
Okay. Thank you for the solidarity by the way,
一丘之貉
and sticking with your friend.
埃利希  告訴巴克讓他去死
You know what, Erlich? You can tell Barker to go fuck himself,
這樣我就能去"震顫光線"
so I can go to Flutterbeam
看著這倆混蛋自生自滅了
and then watch these two assholes crash and burn
他們自以為能打造好'魔笛手'呢
trying to build out Pied Piper by themselves.
真是太棒了
This'll be great.
挑得真是時候啊  伙計們  我謝謝你們
Great timing, guys. Thank you so much.
你厲害  迪尼希
Premium stuff, Dinesh.
理查德  理查德
Richard. Richard?
現在我們這里是后理格比時代了
Well, we are now living in a post-Rigby world.
這地方好棒
Man, this place is amazing.
是啊  我們籌了一大筆錢
Yeah. We raised a shit ton of money.
發展速度要上天了
We're growing fast as balls.
但我們的工程質量
But we're not exactly super psyched
還不是太強
with the quality of our engineering.
所以我來了就好了  對吧
Well, it's a good thing I'm here then, right?
說真的  對于你們的視頻平臺
All joking aside, I actually have a few thoughts
我有幾個想法  如果你...
on your video platform if you--
我們很滿意我們的基礎平臺
We're pretty happy with the basic platform.
我們要把更贊的任務交給你
We want to hand you something way cooler.
算是一個秘密項目吧
It's kind of like a secret project.
我可得提醒你  真的太贊了
I got to warn you, though. It's pretty rad.
坐吧
Sit right here.
好  你好
All right. Oh. Hello.
這是現在
This is the present.
準備好進入未來了嗎
You ready to go to the future?
當然
Sure.
三  二  一
Three, two, one.
看
Bam!
我長胡子了
Oh. I-- I have a mustache.
沒錯  的確是
Fuck yeah, you do.
看看這個
And check this out.
把頭側一點  看到了嗎
Turn your head. See that?
完美的3D全息合成影像胡
Compositing perfect 3-D holographic mustaches
在視頻聊天中使用距離感應攝像頭
using depth-sensing cameras in a live video chat.
-還沒人做這個呢  -史無前例
- And no one's doing it. - Nobody.
抱歉  這就是你們說的很贊的東西嗎
Sorry. This is the-- this is the rad thing?
理查德  我們承認
Look, Richard, we agree, okay?
的確還不夠好
We're not there yet.
插件不咋地  所以延遲太高
We're using a crappy plug-in, so the latency is bad.
頭轉得太快的話  胡子會掛到耳朵上
You turn too fast, that mustache is on your ear.
但有你的幫忙  我們認為我們可以將延時時間
But with your help, we think we can cut our 'stache lag
縮短到...  20毫秒  變成光速
to just... 20 milliseconds motion-to-photon
在九個月之內可以嗎
in... nine months?
剛好能趕上胡子節
Just in time for Movember.
你員工牌上的照片想用哪種胡子呢
So, which one do you want on your employee badge?
-湯姆·賽立克  -你好
- Tom Selleck? - Aloha.
傅滿楚
Ooh, Fu Manchu.
-約翰·沃特斯  -不錯
- John Waters. - Not bad.
埃里克斯·催柏克  希特勒
Alex Trebek. Hitler.
希特勒還是不要了吧
Probably not Hitler. Skip him. Oh yeah.
-看  薩姆·艾利奧特  -你好啊
- Bam. Sam Elliot. - Howdy.
好吧
Sure.
我們得去接個電話
Okay, so we've got to hop on a call with biz dev...
你可以繼續玩胡子
Okay. ...but feel free to keep on 'staching. Okay?
-給你  -走了
- There you go. - All right.
對了  如果你想
Hey, if you want to have
讓你律師來看看雇傭合同
your attorney look over the employment agreement
和股票期權協議  都沒有問題的
and the stock option grant, it's cool by us, all right?
簽下合同  就是我們的一員了
Just sign it. You're in.
周一見咯  我們很激動呢
We'll see you Monday, man. We're pumped.
你們這么激動搞得我都激動了
Okay. Well, your pumpedness makes me pumped.
我想找皮特·莫納漢  我是理查德·亨德里克斯
Pete Monahan, please. It's Richard Hendricks.
我需要他幫我看份合同
I just need him to go over a contract for me.
什么
What?
你是來見客戶的律師嗎
Are you an attorney here to see a client?
不  我是來見我的律師的
No, actually, I'm a client here to see my attorney.
好吧  跟我來
Okay. Follow me.
一開始只是無傷大雅地在慶祝仲裁勝利
It began as a innocent celebration of our arbitration victory.
我點了杯康普茶  卻沒想到里面有酒精
I ordered a kombucha, which I did not realize contained alcohol.
他們告訴我那是一種健康有機茶
It was described to me as a healthy, organic tea.
結果等我醒過來  我已經跑出70英里了
Next thing I knew, I was 70 miles away,
全身赤裸  只裹著一條毯子
wrapped naked in a blanket,
藥勁還沒過去
shaking off a meth high,
還因為拿鐵鍬襲擊警用馬而被指控
and facing charges for attacking a police horse with a shovel.
我操
Oh. Holy shit.
從法律角度上  我違反了假釋條例
From a legal standpoint, it was a clear violation of my parole,
必須要服全刑
and I must now serve my entire sentence...
好吧
Okay.
再加上新的罪名
...and any additional time stemming from the new charges,
都加在了我的刑期里
which continue to accrue.
但我會為自己的錯誤負責
But I'm owning my mistakes.
我要保持樂觀
I am staying positive.
我的事就是這些
Enough about me.
給我看看你的合同
Let's take a look at that contract.
好
Okay.
我是想拿紅筆標記一下  可是
I would red-line it, but...
我不能拿鉛筆
I'm not allowed to have a pencil.
這程序越看越不對勁啊
This makes less sense the more I look at it.
這個數字是什么
Okay. What's this number over here?
我不知道
I don't know.
壓縮庫不是我負責的
I didn't handle the compression library.
也不是我啊
Neither did I.
你是說這些都是理查德自己做的
You're telling me Richard did this all on his own?
靠  我以為是你做的呢
Shit. I thought you did it.
現在我更看不起你了
Now I respect you even less.
我們每個人對這平臺都有90%的理解
We each know 90 percent of the platform...
可是卻是同樣的90%
but it's the same 90 percent.
或許那個自大狂是對的
Maybe that arrogant prick was right.
沒有他  我們擴展不了
We can't scale it without him.
我們完蛋了
We are so fucked.
等等
Wait.
-怎么了  -我懂了
- Yeah? - I got it.
我們可以跟理查德一起退出
We quit out of solidarity with Richard.
真有意思
That's interesting.
盡管他對咱倆說了那些屁話
So even though he said all that horrible shit to us,
我們還是不計較
we take the high road
繼續支持他
and we get his back.
或許他還會讓新公司雇傭我們呢
Maybe he'll even hire us at his new company.
震顫光線
Flutterbeam.
-胡子  -沒錯
- Mustaches? - Yes.
不止是可以給人加胡子
Doesn't necessarily have to stop at people.
他們還可以給寵物也加上胡子
They can put mustaches on their pets, too.
真的挺好玩的
It's actually pretty fun.
所以  不久之后你就能給貓貓狗狗  還有蛇
So, soon you'll be putting mustaches on cats and dogs and...
-加胡子了  -蛇啊  好吧好吧
- snakes. - Snakes, yeah, yeah.
不過蛇比較麻煩  因為它們沒有人中
I mean, it's a little tricky because they don't have a philtrum,
所以要給胡子找個定位點會比較...
so finding an anchor point for that mustache is actually...
會是一個技術性挑戰
gonna be quite of a technological challenge.
-真挺有意思的  真的  -理查德
- It's exciting stuff. It really is. - Richard.
理查德
Richard.
我問你件事
Let me ask you something.
你為什么離開魔笛手
Why are you leaving Pied Piper?
他們把我踢出來了
They pushed me out.
他們不是給了你另一個職位嗎
I thought they offered you another position.
對  首席技術官  他們給我降職了
Yeah, CTO. It's a demotion.
但你在震顫光線不也是首席技術官嗎
Well, wouldn't you be CTO at Flutterbeam?
是  但至少那樣  我不用看他們的臉色
Yes, but at least this way, I don't have to eat shit.
理查德  我跟你分享我在這里的一點心得
Richard, let me tell you something I learned here on the inside.
收起你的自尊
Swallow your pride,
不然就遠不止是看臉色了
or soon you'll be eating something far worse than shit.
相信我
Believe me.
難道你不該至少見一見這個巴克嗎
Don't you think you should at least meet this Barker fellow?
進行得怎么樣了
So where are we?
已經辭掉了一千七百多人
Seventeen hundred people slated for exiting.
他們的無效期權總計達到了78萬股
Their negated options total 780,000 shares.
您可以隨意調撥這筆錢
That money can be allocated anyway you see fit.
員工福利  日托中心翻修
Employee bonuses, renovations to the day-care center.
什么都行  先從哪一項開始
What have you. What should we prioritize?
'互利'高層真的要給尼爾森·達頭蒂一個"大頭銜"嗎
抱歉  我不明白
Sorry, I don't understand.
協議里都寫了
It's all in the document.
你接受這個解雇補償協議
You take that severance package,
然后立即從'互利'離職
and you leave Hooli immediately.
不過最重要的條款
But the most important aspect
就是保密和禁止惡言條款
is the non-disclosure, non-disparagement clause,
你同意不得在媒體上  公共或私人場合發表
in which you agree not to say anything negative in the press,
有關'互利'或蓋文·貝爾森的
in public, or in private
任何負面言論
about Hooli or Gavin Belson.
好  我不說
Okay, I won't.
你也不能在全宇宙任何地方發表任何涉及你
You will not discuss anything you did at Hooli
在'互利'的工作內容的言論
at all, in perpetuity,
永遠不能
throughout the universe.
我在'互利'本來也沒做什么  所以
I didn't really do anything at Hooli, so...
那就好  看來你已經明白啦
Good. You're getting the hang of it already.
不過我能留著我的'互利'員工卡嗎
So, can I keep my Hooli ID, though,
我想照常來上班  去屋頂跟我的朋友玩
so I can still come and hang out with my friends on the roof?
不可以
You cannot.
其實  你在'互利'的朋友們都走了
Officially, you will no longer have any friends here.
該死
Shoot.
那我就得考慮考慮了
I have to think about this then.
這份協議條款已經很慷慨了
This settlement offer is quite generous.
我知道我知道  二百萬已經很多了
I know, I know. I mean, $2 million is a lot of money.
二百萬  不對
Two? No. It's...
那是兩千萬
It's $20 million.
兩千萬
Twenty?
他們在雇你之前就趕走了我
So they fired me before they hired you,
因此也不能怨你  我只是
so it's not your fault. I just--
我只是覺得這樣不行
I feel like this... can't really work.
-你明白嗎  -我明白  理查德
- Do you understand? - I do, Richard.
就好像
It's like...
如果我在我自己親手創辦的公司里
can I really be expected to do my best work
始終覺得自己的價值被忽視低估
when I am constantly feeling undervalued
我還怎么能全身心工作呢
at the company that I started?
這樣說你能明白嗎
Does that make sense?
明白  理查德  太明白了
It does, Richard. Absolutely.
你的這些擔憂和顧慮我都知道  都明白
I hear each and every one of your concerns loud and clear,
而且我也尊重你的立場
and I appreciate your position.
所以我們干脆都不干了
So, I guess we just won't do it.
來吧  我送你出去
Come on, I'll walk you out.
慢著  什么
Wait. What?
等等  你剛才說什么  杰克
Sorry. You what? Jack?
我沒明白
Sorry, I don't understand.
你不打算接下這份工作嗎
You're not gonna take the job?
你不在我就不接
Not if you're not.
沒有你負責技術
Without you handling the tech,
這個公司不會有前途
I don't see how this company works.
我是說我也這么想
I mean, yeah, I agree.
理查德  在大家意見一致的情況下管理企業
Richard, it's hard enough running a business
已經非常難了
when everyone is on the same page.
而顯然  你我意見不同
And clearly, we are not.
-這個  是  -沒事沒事  這很正常
- Well... yeah. - No, no, it's fine,
我很感謝你對我如此開誠布公
and I appreciate you being so honest with me.
現在說清楚總比日后要好吧
I mean, better we find out now, right?
總之我希望咱倆都能找到合適的工作
Anyway, I hope we each find a good fit somewhere.
多謝來訪
Thanks for coming up.
你的頭腦實在難得  理查德·亨德里克斯
You got a hell of a brain there, Richard Hendricks.
路上小心
You drive safe.
