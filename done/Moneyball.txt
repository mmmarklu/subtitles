難以置信 打了一輩子球 卻依然對它知之甚微

一支二壘安打 一支三壘安打 兩次盜壘
a double, a triple, a couple of stolen bases.
他在賽季首場比賽中擊出4支安打

好球
Strike.
2001年 10月15日
球擊到右外野邊線 戴蒙這支是界內球

Hammered down the right-field line. Justice!
洋基隊領先了

片名 魔球
他們佇立著 期待又一次
They're standing, anticipating another trip
挺進聯盟冠軍賽的旅程
to the League championship Series.
洋基隊只需解決最後一個打者
The Yankees one out away.
埃裏克.伯恩斯 他在洋基主場還沒有打數
Eric Byrnes, never with an at bat in Yankee Stadium,
這次估計也不會有什麼斬獲
and they don't get much bigger than this one.
孤注一擲也未必有結果
Or more hectic when you're up there trying to get a job done.

揮棒落空
And they're a strike away.

沒關係 喬 讓它開著吧
It's okay, Joe, you can leave it on.
- 我可以不看 - 喬 開著
I don't need to watch. Joe, leave it on.
好吧
Okay.
想像一下 作為洋基隊隊員
Imagine how bad it'd be if you were a Yankee player
卻不喜歡當喝香檳該怎麼辦
and didn't like the taste of champagne.
只能請求轉會吧
Better ask to get traded.
必須給洋基隊…
You gotta giVe the Yankees...
…贏得冠軍
- win the big game.
接下來將是怎樣的比賽…
What a series that is gonna be in the next...
你知道有多少孩子穿著吉安比
You know how many kids are wearing Giambi's...?
吉安比在奧克蘭的運動套衫 帽子 畫像和海報嗎
You know, Oakland Giambi's jerseys and hats and pictures and posters?
- 洋基隊七月來這裏時這些孩子會噓聲一片 - 希望如此
Those same kids will be booing in July when the Yankees come here.
到底是吉安比落井下石 還是東岸的銅臭商人過分
Is it Giambi that's stabbing the back or the Pinstripes on the East coast?
你不能怪他們巧取豪奪
You can't blame them for pilfering the henhouse.
- 資源擺著不能浪費啊 - 什麼叫不能怪他們
The henhouse is there. I can't blame them?
六年裏他們出了1億2千萬美元
They're offering $ 120 million oVer six years.
紐約洋基隊比我們錢多 他們願意給他出大價錢
The Yankees haVe deeper pockets and they're willing to giVe him money.
他們在收割我們的隊員
They're pilfering our players.
好像我們是紐約洋基隊的菜地似的
It's like we're a farm system for the new York Yankees.
- 隊員們打得怎麼樣 - 他們很厲害
How are the guys doing? That was a killer.
很厲害 很難啃下來 這…
That was a killer. It's a tough one to swallow. It's...
- 他們打得很好 - 就差拋頭顱灑熱血了
They played great. They played their hearts out.
他們盡力了 打得很精彩 只是結果不盡如人意
They did. They played fantastic. It just didn't fall our way.
- 明年你們會打得更好 - 不過就差一點啊 是吧
You'll do better next year. But we were close, though.
很接近了 就差一點
We were so close. Right there.
差點就勝利了 你應該開心的
Almost had it. You gotta feel good about that.
我開心死了 開心極了
I feel great about it. I feel great about it.
唔
Um...
明年不會打得更好
We're not gonna do better next year.
- 為什麼 - 你知道我們正被人魚肉
Why not? Well, you know we're being gutted.
吉安比 戴蒙和伊斯林豪森都要走了
We're losing Giambi, Damon, Isringhausen.
都談定了 我們麻煩很大
Done deal. We're in trouble.
你能找到新人的 當初就是你發現了傑森和戴蒙
You'll find new guys. You found Jason, you found Damon.
- 我要更多的資金 史蒂夫 - 比利
I need more money, Steve. Billy.
- 我需要錢 - 我們沒錢了
I need more money. We don't have any.
我不能用3800萬美元去抗衡1億2千萬啊
I can't compete against $ 120 million with $38 million.
我們不能和有更大預算的隊伍比
We're not gonna compete with these teams that have big budgets.
我們必須在自己能力範圍內運作
We're gonna work within the constraints we have,
而你要盡全力招募新隊員
and you're gonna do the best job that you can recruiting new players.
我們沒法每年付給隊員1700萬
We're not gonna pay $ 17 million to players.
我又沒要你出…
I'm not asking you
1千萬 2千萬或3千萬
for 10 or 20, 30 million dollars.
我只要求一點幫助
I'm just asking for a bit of help.
再幫我一下 我就能幫你組成冠軍隊
Get me a little closer and I will get you that championship team.
你雇我就是為了這個 這就是我的工作
I mean, this is why I'm here. This is why you hired me.
我要問 我們在這兒費什麼話…
And I gotta ask you, what are we doing here
- 比利 我... - …如果不是想贏冠軍
Billy, l... if it's not to win a championship?
- 我也很想… - 我的目標就在這裏 這裏
I wanna win just as much... That's my bar. My bar is here.
目標是帶隊贏得冠軍
My bar is to take this team to the championship.
比利 我們是小市場球隊 你是小市場球隊的經理
Billy, we're a small-market team, and you're a small-market GM.
我不能付出我沒有的錢 請你面對現實
I'm asking you to be okay not spending money that I don't have.
請你深呼吸一口
And I'm asking you to take a deep breath,
忘掉失敗 回到隊裏去
shake off the loss, get back in a room with your guys,
想辦法用我們手頭的錢
and figure out how to find replacements for the guys we lost
找到能替代離開隊員的新人
with the money that we do have.
我不走 我不能就這樣走啊
I'm not leaving here. I'm not... I can't leave here with that.
我還能幫你什麼嗎
What else can I help you with?
這個開價太好了 你得想辦法趕超 我…
It's a good offer, and you gotta match it. L...
我需要一點時間
I need another day.
他很堅決 我想你應該明白
His mind's pretty made up. I just think you should know that.
- 有電話進來 我一會兒打給你 - 我一定會轉告他的
I got a call. I'll get you back. I'll let him know.
再見
Bye.
- 喂 - 比利 是我 史考特
Yeah? Billy, Scott.
- 剛跟丹通了電話 - 不是吧
Just got off the phone with Dan. You didn't.
他打給我 我很驚訝
I was surprised he called me.
住口 我給強尼開價750萬 他不為別人效力
Stop. I got Johnny for 7.5 or he doesn't play anywhere else.
- 這是你答應的 - 波士頓隊加碼到775萬
That's the deal you made. Boston just upped it to 7. 75.
你還在嗎
You there?
- 我們說好的 史考特 - 是說好了 如果你能加到800萬
We had a deal, Scott. We haVe a deal, if it's 8 million.
- 夥計 你耍我啊 - 我只是為客戶服務
Oh, man, you played me. I'm just doing my job for my client.
不 你是耍我 而且你現在也在耍我
No, you're playing me, and you're still playing me.
恭喜你 混蛋 你贏了
Congratulations, asshole. You win.
我喜歡屁股上長點毛的傢伙
I like guys that got a little hair on their ass.
坦白說 他是曼托或者梅斯那個層次的
He looks like a Mantle or a Mays, quite frankly.
- 他天生就是棒球手的體魄 - 馬蒂 你找到誰了
He's got a baseball body. Matty, who do you got?
- 我喜歡吉拉尼莫 - 對
I like Geronimo. Yes.
這傢伙是好運動員 塊頭大 速度快 有天賦
The guy's an athlete. Big, fast, talented.
- 我手裏排第一的 - 長得好看 輪廓鮮明
Top of my list. Clean-cut, good face.
- 對 下巴很壯 - 全能型的
Yeah, good jaw. Five-tools guy.
- 長得不錯的球手 - 擅長打擊嗎
Good-Iooking ballplayer. Can he hit?
- 他揮棒姿勢很漂亮 是吧 傑瑞米 - 他能把球打爆
He's got a beautiful swing. The ball explodes off his bat.
他用棒尖擊球 接觸到球時
He throws the club head at the ball, and when he connects,
他用力擊出 球會砰地飛走
he drives it, it pops off the bat.
- 整個球場都能聽到 - 擊中率很高
You can hear it all over the ballpark. A lot of pop.
如果他很會打 為什麼打得不好
If he's good, why doesn't he hit good?
- 他是個好打者 - 遲早他會出頭的
He is a good hitter. He'll be ready.
他好得足以抵抗大聯盟投手嗎
He's gonna be a good hitter against big-league arms?
- 應該不錯的 - 我不這麼想
Could be great. I don't think so.
新人需要打數 超過四百 他就會變好
Kid needs at bats. Give him 400 at bats, he's gonna get better.
他可以打的
He can play.
他可以指哪打哪
He's hit everywhere along the line.
他就是我們要的人
He's one of our guys.
好 我們繼續
Okay, let's move on.
- 阿迪 你喜歡誰 - 我喜歡佩雷斯 他的擊球姿勢很標準
Artie, who do you like? I like Perez. He's got a classic swing.
- 絕對是完美打擊 - 我不覺得 他能打曲線球嗎
It's a real clean stroke. I don't know. Can't hit the curveball.
還需要改進 我承認 不過他也值得關注
There's some work to be done, I'll admit that, but he's noticeable.
- 女朋友很醜 - 什麼意思
Got an ugly girlfriend. What's that mean?
- 女朋友丑證明他沒自信 - 好吧
Ugly girlfriend means no confidence.
你們都昏頭了 阿迪是對的 這個人很有架勢
You are full of it. Artie is right. This guy's got an attitude.
有架勢是好事
An attitude is good.
他就是那種人還沒走進來 已經雄風高昂的人
He walks in a room, his dick's already been there for two minutes.
他並非是華而不實的 恰恰外型是不錯
He passes the eye-candy test. Got the looks.
他已經準備好了 就是需要比賽經驗
He's ready to play the part. He just needs playing time.
我只是說他的女朋友馬馬虎虎
I'm just saying, his girlfriend is a six at best.
- 如果要代替吉安比 他應該行 - 巴拉巴拉
Look, if we're trying to replace Giambi, this guy could be it.
- 我同意 - 巴拉巴拉巴拉
I agree with you. La-la-la-la-la.
見鬼 比利 你是想提建議嗎
Damn, Billy, was that a suggestion?
夥計們 你們就說個沒完
Guys, you're just talking.
說啊說 啦啦啦啦 好像這還是例行公事
Talking, "la-la-la-la-la," like this is business as usual.
但不是
It's not.
我們在努力解決問題 比利
We're trying to solve the problem.
不是這樣的 你們都沒正視問題
Not like this. You're not looking at the problem.
我們很清楚問題是什麼 我是說…
We're very aware of the problem. I mean...
好吧 問題是什麼
Okay, good. What's the problem?
聽著 比利 我們都知道問題何在 我們必須找人代替…
Look, Billy, we all understand what the problem is. We have to...
很好 問題是什麼
Okay, good. What's the problem?
問題是我們要找人代替 三個重要隊員
We have to replace three key players in our lineup.
不對 問題是什麼
Nope. What's the problem?
山姆說了 我們要補上空缺的…
We gotta replace these guys with what we have...
不對 問題是什麼 貝瑞
No. What's the problem, Barry?
我們需要找到38個全壘打 120個打點 47個二壘安打
We need 38 home runs, 120 RBIs and 47 doubles to replace.
我們要解決的問題是 如果這是有錢球隊
The problem we're trying to solve is that there are rich teams
這裏是窮隊 然後下面是說不清的垃圾
and there are poor teams, then there's 50 feet of crap,
然後才是我們
and then there's us.
這是不公平的比賽
It's an unfair game.
現在我們正被人宰割 就像在給富人捐獻器官
And now we've been gutted. We're like organ donors for the rich.
波士頓拿走了我們的腎臟 洋基隊拿走了我們的心臟
Boston's taken our kidneys, Yankees have taken our heart.
而你們坐在這裏
And you guys sit around
說什麼"好體魄"的屁話 好像我們只是在賣牛仔褲
talking the same old "good body" nonsense like we're selling jeans.
好像我們在找法比奧 （身材一流的意大利籍男星）
Like we're looking for Fabio.
我們必須轉變思路
We got to think differently.
我們是吊車尾的
We are the last dog at the bowl.
你們知道最弱的狗崽 什麼下場嗎 餓死
You see what happens to the runt of the litter? He dies.
比利 這故事很感人 真的
Billy, that's a very touching story and everything,
但我想我們都很清楚現在的情況
but I think we're all very much aware of what we're facing.
你是我們中間最有經驗最有智慧的
You have a lot of experience and wisdom in this room.
你需要對我們有點信心 讓我們找到能代替吉安比的人
You need to have a little faith and let us do the job of replacing Giambi.
還有像吉安比這樣的一壘手嗎
Is there another first baseman like Giambi?
- 沒有了 - 沒有
No, not really. No.
- 如果有 我們能買得起嗎 - 不行
If there was, could we afford him? Nope.
那你們還談個屁
Then what the fuck are you talking about, man?
如果我們在這還像洋基隊那樣行事
If we try to play like the Yankees in here,
在賽場上我們會輸得一塌塗地
we will lose to the Yankees out there.
這聽起來像空泛的大話而已 比利
Boy, that sounds like fortune-cookie wisdom to me, Billy.
- 不 這是邏輯思考 - 誰是法比奧啊
No, that's just logic. Who's Fabio?
他是游擊手 西雅圖人
He's a shortstop. He's a shortstop from Seattle.
現在沒時間恐慌了
Now, this is no time to push the panic button.
比利 我們的球探會物色球員 然後進行培訓
Our scouts will find players, Player Development will develop them.
我們教他們成為 奧克蘭運動家隊的球手
We'll teach them to play Oakland A baseball.
- 各位… - 沒有惡意 但我們一直這樣做的
With all due respect, we've been doing this a long time.
你應該把替代吉安比的事交給我們
Why don't you just let us be responsible for replacing Giambi
我們去找能勝任的人
with who we know that can play?
- 力道普通 - 鬆垮
Easy power. And loose.
這孫子可以進首發陣容
This son of a bitch is going in the first round.
你是優秀的選手 比利
You're a premium player, Billy.
你能跑 能守 能投 能打
You can run, you can field, you can throw, you can hit,
可以大力擊球
you can hit with power.
這並不多見
That doesn't come along Very often.
- 這是湯姆.馬丁內斯 國聯球探 - 很高興認識你
This is Tom Martinez, national cross-checker.
- 你好嗎 - 比利.賓恩
How you doing? Billy Beane.
很高興認識你
Nice to meet you.
已經有段時間沒看到全能型選手了
It's been a while since I've seen a five-tool guy that can do everything.
我期望你對加入職棒的興趣
I'm hopeful your interest in professional baseball
和我們一樣濃厚 我們可以一同前進
is as strong as ours is gonna be in getting you in this upcoming draft.
賓恩先生嗎
WOMr. Beane?
馬克可以見您了
Mark is ready to see you now.
- 你今天好嗎 - 我很好
How you doing? WOI'm fine.
How are you? Good.
- 嘿 比利 - 嗨 馬克
Hey, Billy. Hey, Mark.
見到你真高興 請坐
Good to see you. Please sit down. You too.
- 這是我的夥計們 夥計們 這位是比利 - 大家好
These are the guys. Guys, Billy. Boys.
- 近況如何 - 還不錯 你怎樣
How's it going? All right. How you been?
- 你坐這椅子很像樣啊 - 我已經坐了三個周了
You're filling out that chair nicely. I got three weeks in it right now.
很好 兄弟
Good, good, man.
- 嗯 你怎樣呢 - 很不錯
Yeah, man. How you doing? Fantastic.
- 好極了 - 再好不過了
Awesome. Couldn't be better.
真是好消息 我不想浪費你的時間
That's good to hear. I'm not gonna waste your time.
你直接說你要什麼吧
You just tell me what you're looking for.
加薪5000萬
Fifty million dollars in additional payroll.
你應該找吉安比要
You should try Giambi.
- 正中痛處 - 抱歉 開玩笑太早了 是吧
Ouch. I'm sorry. Too soon, right?
我想本次會面友善一些
I want this to be a friendly meeting.
但這不全是你的責任吧
It's not all on your shoulders.
- 史蒂夫怎麼說 - 史蒂夫沒問題
Where's Steve in this? Steve's great.
他100%全力支持重建隊伍
He's supportive in rebuilding this team.
我們正想這麼做
That's what we're gonna do.
- 那你想要什麼 - 左投後援投手
So, what are you looking for? A left-handed reliever.
我想要裏卡多.林康
I'm thinking Ricardo Rincon.
不可能的
That's not gonna happen.
談都不能談嗎
Not even a discussion?
比利 就算你買得起 別介意我這麼說 我們也很喜歡他
Billy, even if you could afford him, respectfully, we love him.
我們不會轉讓的
We're not about to let him go.
但你們買了北卡羅萊拉的 委內瑞拉新人 不是嗎
You got this Venezuelan kid coming up.
沒錯 已經轉給底特律了
We had him. We moved him to Detroit.
- 哈 - 還有什麼想法嗎
Huh. What else you thinking?
外野手
Outfielders.
- 代替戴蒙嗎 - 對
To replace Damon? Yeah.
- 就你能出的價格? 我沒有惡意哈 - 足夠了 馬克
In your price range? No disrespect. Enough, Mark.
呃...哈林斯?
Uh... Hollins?
不
Uh-uh.
- 加西亞? - 不行
Garcia? No.
那麼 科斯特
Maybe Coste.
哼
Uh-uh.
只能這樣了
That's it.
- 好吧 就加西亞吧 - 來代替強尼.戴蒙嗎
All right, tell me about Garcia. To replace Johnny Damon?
- 馬克 他健康沒問題吧 - 對 他正在恢復
Mark, is he healthy? Yeah, he's healthy-ish.
不瞞你說 他背有點問題 是吧
He had that back thing.
- 春季賽就能出賽了 - 我直說吧
He'll be ready for spring ball. I'll tell you what.
如果你貼點錢 我可以換格思裏
I can give you Guthrie if you kick in some cash.
- 馬克.格思裏？ - 對
Mark Guthrie? Yeah.
- 多少錢 - 20萬
How much cash? Two hundred K.
好
Okay.
- 不能給你加西亞 - 你逗我的吧
So Garcia's gonna be a no. You're kidding me, right?
- 你開玩笑 - 沒有
You're kidding me. I'm not.
好吧 加西亞換格思裏 不貼錢
Okay. Straight up, Garcia for Guthrie, no kicker.
- 不貼錢了? - 一清二楚
No kicker? Straight up.
加西亞絕對不行 但我們還能談談別人
I think it's gonna be a hard no on Garcia, but let's just keep going.
- 你還有想要的嗎 - 這是幹嘛啊 我們是在做生意吧
What else you thinking? What are we doing? Is this business?
我們在克利夫蘭就這麼做生意
This is the way we do business in Cleveland.
嘿
Hey.
- 你好 - 你是誰
Hello. Who are you?
我是皮特.布蘭德
I'm Peter Brand.
你做什麼的
What do you do?
我是馬克.史派羅的特別助理
I'm special assistant to Mark Shapiro.
所以 你做什麼的
So, what do you do?
現在基本上是球員分析評估
Mostly player analysis right now.
工作多久了 是在棒球界的第一份工作?
Been on the job long? First job in baseball?
這就是我的第一份工作
It's my first job anywhere.
- 哇 恭喜啊 - 謝謝
Wow, congrats. Thank you.
第一份工作 你是誰的侄子
First job. Whose nephew are you?
馬克為什麼會聽你的
Why does Mark listen to you?
我不認為…
I don't think, uh...
我不認為他經常聽我的
I don't think he does very often.
但剛才有
He just did.
在那種情況下
Well, in that circumstance,
我想他其實是聽布魯斯的 不是我的
I think he was more listening to Bruce than myself.
嗯 你是誰
Mm-hm. Who are you?
我是皮特.布蘭德
I'm Peter Brand.
我才他媽不管你叫什麼
I don't give a rat's ass what your name is.
剛才是怎麼回事
What happened in there?
剛才在裏面是怎麼回事
What happened in that room?
我不太清楚你想問什麼 賓恩先生
I'm not quite sure what you're asking me, Mr. Beane.
你跟布魯斯說了什麼
What did you tell Bruce?
- 我只是說我喜歡加西亞 - 你為什麼喜歡加西亞
I just told Bruce I like Garcia. You like Garcia. Why?
為什麼
Why?
我不知道
I don't know. Ahem.
在這個圈子裏 有種蔓延性的
There is an epidemic failure within the game
盲目無視現狀的習慣
to understand what is really happening.
這讓運作棒球大聯盟賽的人
And this leads people who run Major League Baseball teams
錯誤估計了自己的球員和隊伍
to misjudge their players and mismanage their teams.
真是抱歉
I apologize.
繼續說
Go on.
好 經營棒球俱樂部的那些人 思維總是買賣球員
Okay. People who run ball clubs, they think in terms of buying players.
你的目的不應該是買賣球員 而是買取勝利
Your goal shouldn't be to buy players. Your goal should be to buy wins.
要買到勝利 就要買得分
And in order to buy wins, you need to buy runs.
你想找人代替強尼.戴蒙
You're trying to replace Johnny Damon.
波士頓紅襪隊看中強尼.戴蒙
The Red Sox see Johnny Damon
是看到一個價值750萬美元一年的明星
and they see a star who's worth $7.5 million a year.
而我看強尼.戴蒙
When I see Johnny Damon,
我看到的是...
what I see is...
對如何得分毫無概念的球員
an imperfect understanding of where runs come from.
他是不錯的守備隊員
The guy's got a great gloVe.
是很好的首發打者 他很會盜壘
He's a decent leadoff hitter. He can steal bases.
但他值波士頓紅襪隊給的 每年750萬的薪金嗎
But is he worth the $ 7.5 million a year that the Boston Red Sox are paying him?
不 不值
No. No.
棒球的思維還在中世紀水平
Baseball thinking is medieVal.
他們的想法都有問題
They are asking all the wrong questions.
如果我這樣告訴別人 我就是反動派 冒天下之大不韙
And if I say it to anybody, I'm ostracized. I'm a leper.
所以我才跟你繞圈子
So that's why I'm cagey about this with you.
所以我...
That's why...
我尊敬你 賓恩先生 如果你想聽掏心窩的話
I respect you, Mr. Beane, and if you want full disclosure,
我覺得你放掉戴蒙是件好事
I think it's a good thing that you got Damon off your payroll.
我覺得這會帶來很多有趣的可能性
I think it opens up all kinds of interesting possibilities.
- 你家鄉是哪兒 皮特 - 馬裏蘭
Where you from, Pete? Maryland.
- 你在哪裏上學 - 耶魯 我在耶魯上學
Where'd you go to school? Yale. I went to Yale.
- 你學什麼的 - 經濟學
What'd you study? Economics.
我學經濟的
I studied economics.
耶魯 經濟學 還有棒球
Yale, economics and baseball.
你很有意思 Pete
You're funny, Pete.
告訴我 為什麼是比利
Tell me, why Billy?
是什麼讓他脫穎而出
What is it that makes him special?
很難遇到比利這樣的年輕人
Very rare do you come upon a young man like Billy
能跑 能守 能投 能打
who can run, who can field, who can throw, who can hit,
還能擊出好球
and who can hit with power.
這五種技能齊備 不多見的
Those five tools, you don't see that very often.
我們中意的絕大部分年輕選手
Most of the youngsters that we have an interest in
擅長一項或兩項技能
have one or two tools,
我們還希望他們能多發展一項
and we're hoping to develop an extra one.
而你的兒子五項全能
Your son has five.
我們在為紐約找一個未來的超級巨星
We're looking at a guy that's a potential superstar for us in New York.
現在是時候讓他起飛了
The time is now to get him started.
我們準備好了優厚的待遇
We're prepared to make a sizable financial commitment.
大都會隊會全力支持比利
The Mets are gonna stand behind Billy
因為我們期望他成為 大聯盟裏的中場手
because we expect him to be our big-league center fielder.
這張支票代表了紐約大都會隊
This check here represents the offer
會給比利的豐厚回報
that the New York Mets would be making to Billy.
你應該知道他已經得到了 斯坦福大學的全額獎學金
You do know that he's been accepted to Stanford on a full scholarship?
我知道
I do.
所以他能兩面兼顧了嗎
So he can do both?
很不幸的 他不能同時 上斯坦福和職業棒球賽
Unfortunately, he can't do Stanford and professional baseball.
他必須有所取捨
He would have to pick one or the other.
如果要當大都會隊的中場手
If he wants to be center fielder for the Mets,
當一名棒球運動員
wants to be a baseball player,
他必須將此作為人生第一位的事業和職業
he really needs to accept this as life's first occupation, first career.
某個時刻總會有人告訴我們 不能再玩小孩子的遊戲了
We're all told at some point we can no longer play the children's game.
只是我們不清楚是什麼時刻
We just don't know when that's gonna be.
有些人18歲就聽到 有些人40歲才知道 但總會有那個時候
Some of us are told at 18, some of us are told at 40, but we're all told.
這是一生一次的機遇
But this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
我們很看好你 而這筆錢的數目 充分表達了我們的渴望
We want you badly, and we think that this amount of money expresses that desire.
比利 這是你的選擇 不過無論你怎麼決定
Billy, this is your decision, and whatever that decision is,
我和你媽媽都沒有意見
you know it's fine with your mother and I.
- 喂 - 嘿 我是比利 賓恩
Hello? Hey, it's Billy Beane.
- 現在幾點啊 - 我不知道
Hey, what time is it? I don't know.
聽著 第一輪選秀你會挑我嗎
Listen, would you have drafted me in the first round?
什麼
What?
我離開之後 你在電腦上查過我
After I left, you looked me up on your computer.
第一輪選秀你會挑我嗎啊
Would you have drafted me in the first round?
會的 你是個好球手
I did, yeah. You were a good player.
別胡扯 夥計
Cut the crap, man.
第一輪選秀你會挑我嗎啊
Would you have drafted me in the first round?
我會把你排到第九輪 沒有簽約金
I'd haVe taken you in the ninth round. No signing bonus.
我猜你會放棄 接受斯坦福的獎學金
I imagine you would'Ve passed and taken that scholarship.
沒錯
Yeah.
打包吧 皮特
Pack your bags, Pete.
我剛從克利夫蘭印第安隊手上買了你
I just bought you from the Cleveland Indians.
- 這是連著那個夾子嗎 - 對 我來解開
Is it attached to that clamp? Yeah, let me unhook it.
從那裏滑下來
Slide it up right there.
- 到左邊 - 我是啊
To the left. I did.
- 好 好 - 等等 有點濕
Yeah, yeah. Hang on, it's wet.
放吧
Come on.
- 早安 蘇珊 咖啡好了嗎 - 對
Morning, Suzanne. Coffee on? Yes.
很好
Great.
- 比利.賓恩辦公室 - 嘿
Billy Beane's office. Hey.
- 皮特.布蘭德 - 比利
Peter Brand. Billy.
- 你好…嗨 你好嗎 - 見到你真開心
How are...? Hi, how you doing? Nice to see you.
你能來真好 你動作真快啊
Good to have you here. Boy, you move in fast.
對 我今早到的
Yeah, yeah. I got here early this morning.
Wow. Huh.
- 都搬好了 - 不錯
All moved in. Yeah.
是啊
Yeah.
嗨 比利
Hey, Billy,
我希望你看看
I wanted you to see these player evaluations
你要我做的球員評估
that you asked me to do.
我要你評估三個
I asked you to do three.
對
Yeah.
- 評估三個球員 - 是啊
To evaluate three players. Yeah.
你做了幾個
How many did you do?
47個
Forty-seven.
不錯
Okay.
其實是51個 我不知道剛才為什麼撒謊
Actually, 51. I don't know why I lied just then.
你陪我去計分牌下走走吧
Why don't you walk me through the board?
謝謝
Thank you.
用左上角的這個方程式
Using this equation in the upper left,
我認為我們至少需要贏99場比賽
I'm projecting that we need to win at least 99 games
才能打入季後賽
in order to make it to the postseason.
要贏這麼多場 我們至少拿下814分
We need to score at least 814 runs in order to win those games
最多只能輸645分
and allow no more than 645 runs.
這是什麼
What's this?
是我做的年度球員評估規則
This is a code that I'Ve written for our year-to-year projections.
是根據我們掌握的所有 資訊對球員進行評估
This is building in the intelligence that we haVe to project players.
然後呢
Okay.
就是將各種信息數字化
It's about getting things down to one number.
通過我們特有的數據分析
Using the stats the way we read them,
就會發現別人看不到的 球員的潛在價值
we'll find Value in players that nobody else can see.
有的人才因為
People are oVerlooked
各種偏見和外在的缺點被忽視
for a Variety of biased reasons and perceiVed flaws.
比如年齡 外貌 性格
Age, appearance, personality.
比爾.詹姆斯運用數學摒棄這些因素
Bill James and mathematics cut straight through that.
比利 在我們評估的2萬個球員中
Billy, of the 20,000 notable players for us to consider,
我相信就有我們付得起的25個
I believe that there is a championship team
可以組建一支奪冠隊的球員
of 25 people that we can afford,
因為其他業內人士都低估了他們
because everyone else in baseball undervalues them.
他們就像被孤立的不匹配玩具
Like an island of misfit toys.
比利 這是查德.布拉德福 他是後援投手
Billy, this is chad Bradford. He's a relief pitcher.
他就是最被低估的球員之一
He is one of the most undervalued players in baseball.
他的缺點是投球動作很滑稽
His defect is that he throws funny.
就因為他動作滑稽 棒球大聯盟沒人看重他
Nobody in the big leagues cares about him because he looks funny.
如果在我們手上 這傢伙將不只是最佳投手
This guy could be not just the best pitcher in our pen,
而會成為所有棒球比賽中 最牛的後援投手
but one of the most effectiVe relief pitchers in all baseball.
這人值得年薪300萬美金
This guy should cost $3 million a year.
我們出23萬7就能簽下他
We can get him for 237,000.
比利
Billy.
- 就是這個嗎 - 是
That it? Yeah.
嗨 艾特
Hey, Art.
可以在你們開會前和你談談嗎
Can I talk to you before you get started?
- 我現在有點忙 - 我知道
I'm a bit busy right now. I know.
- 我知道 - 好吧
I know. Okay.
- 大家早上好 - 艾特
Morning, everyone. Art.
- 皮特.布蘭德 很高興見到你 - 皮特死哪兒去了
Peter Brand. Nice to meet you. Where the hell's Pete?
這位是皮特
That's Pete.
找個座位 我馬上回來
Grab a seat. I'll be right back.
行了 你說他在哪兒來著
All right, where did you say he's at?
嗯 他在...
Okay. He's on...
- 那小子是誰 - 是我朋友
Who's the kid? A friend of mine.
只簽一年合同 我沒法指導這支隊
I can't manage this team under a one-year contract.
你當然可以
Well, sure you can.
不 我不行
No, I can't.
好吧 我要拉一個隊去比賽
Okay. I gotta put a team on the field.
之後 我會仔細看看你的合同
After that, I'll take a good long look at your contract.
先和球隊經理簽約 然後再組隊參賽怎麼樣
Deal with the manager's contract, then put a team on the field.
艾特 現在如果地滾球被擊到一壘 沒人接得住
At this moment, if a grounder's hit to first, nobody's there to stop it.
在只簽一年合約的壓力下 幹我這份活可不容易
It's not easy doing what I do under the cloud of a one-year contract.
行了 我能理解
Okay, I understand that.
- 我也有過這種經歷 - 我知道 我知道你也有過
I've been there. I know you have.
一年合約對球員和 球隊經理意味著同樣的壓力
A one-year contract means the same thing to a manager as to a player.
我們沒有信心
There's not a lot of faith there.
上個賽季贏了102場 會有這樣的結果真是奇怪
Which is strange after a 102-win season.
明白了
I see.
你要是輸了賽季最後那場最重要的 前面的勝利就沒人在乎了
If you lose the last game of the season, nobody gives a shit.
- 這麼說現在責任在我了嗎 - 不 艾特 是我的責任
So it's on me now? No, Art, it's on me.
這小伙是新來的經理助理
And the kid is the new assistant GM.
- 好吧 - 行了 各位
Okay. Okay, fellas.
嗨 比利
Hey, Billy.
你不能否認他的攻擊力 他有一手
You can't deny his offensive output. He can play.
我們需要會打球的人
And we need people that can play.
你想先談誰
Who do you wanna talk about first?
一個都不想
None of them.
比利 我們還差38個本壘打 和120個打點
Billy, we got 38 home runs, 120 RBIs to make up for.
各位 你們還是在找人取代吉安比
Guys, you're still trying to replace Giambi.
我告訴過你們我們做不到 我們不能這麼干
I told you we can't do it, and we can't do it.
現在我們能做的是再造一個他
Now, what we might be able to do is re-create him.
- 在總數上再造他 - 在什麼上
Re-create him in the aggregate. The what?
吉安比的上壘率是.477
Giambi's on-base percentage was.477.
戴蒙是.324 奧爾梅多是.291
Damon's on-base, .324. And Olmedo's was.291.
加起來是...
Add that up and you get...
你是要我說話嗎
Do you want me to speak?
當我指著你的時候 是的
When I point at you, yeah.
- 1.092 - 除以3
1.092. Divided by three.
- .364 - 這就是我們要的
.364. That's what we're looking for.
三個球員 三個平均上壘率是...
Three ballplayers... Three ballplayers whose average OBP is...
.364
.364.
- 慢著 這麼算不對 - 沒錯的 阿迪
Wait, that doesn't come out right. It's right, Artie.
- 比利 - 你還要加上這個
Billy. You gotta carry the one.
- 比利 - 把這個去掉
Billy. Scratch this out.
什麼
Yeah?
那是誰
Who's that?
那是皮特
That's Pete.
這裏需要皮特嗎
Does Pete really need to be here?
需要
Yes, he does.
好了 這些就是我們要的人
Okay, here's who we want.
1號: 傑森的弟弟 傑瑞米
Jason's little brother, Jeremy.
- 天啊 - 比利 這可有麻煩
Oh, God. Billy, that's trouble.
比利 如果我...我能插一句 他的問題在場外
Billy, look, if l... Yeah. Billy, if I may, he's had his problems off the field,
而且我們知道他在場上的弱點
and we know what he can't do on the field.
他都開始發福了
He's getting thick around the waist.
有報道說他吸大麻 出入脫衣舞俱樂部
There's reports about him on weed, in strip clubs.
他的上壘率就是我們現在要找的
His on-base percentage is all we're looking at now.
相對於他那28.5萬的身價 傑瑞米的上壘率實在很可觀
And Jeremy gets on base an awful lot for a guy who only costs 285,000.
- 天呢 比利... - 2號
Jeez, Billy... Number two:
- 大衛.賈斯蒂斯 - 哦 不要吧
David Justice. Oh, no.
- 他的腿沒用了 - 這個主意很爛
His legs are gone. Not a good idea.
- 老人賈斯蒂斯? - 怎麼這麼說
Old Man Justice? Why is that?
施泰因布倫納對於他的退步很憤怒 他情願給違約金將他驅逐出隊
Steinbrenner's so pissed at his decline, he's willing to eat his contract to get rid of him.
- 說得好 - 十年前 大衛.賈斯蒂斯的名字還響噹噹的
Exactly. Ten years ago, Justice, big name.
參加了很多重要賽事
Been in big games.
賽季初會將是我們的票房大賣熱點
He's gonna really help our season tickets early in the year,
但到了七八月的三伏天 他可以保持體重我們就走運了
but in the dog days in July, August, we're lucky if he's gonna hit his weight.
比利 他腿都沒用了 他是防守的累贅
Billy, his legs are gone, and he's a defensive liability.
我都懷疑他的擊球速是不是在健在
I question whether the bat speed's there.
- 他的腿沒用了 - 格雷迪
His legs are gone. Grady.
他能上60場比賽就很走運了 你看中他什麼了
We'll be lucky to get 60 games out of him. Why do you like him?
因為他上壘率高
Because he gets on base.
- 這算什麼 - 我們在幹嘛
What is this? What are we doing?
好了 三號
Okay, number three:
- 斯科特.哈特伯格 - 誰
Scott Hatteberg. Who?
- 哈特伯格？ - 正是
Hatteberg? Exactly.
他聽起來就像是奧克蘭運動家隊球員
He sounds like an Oakland A already.
- 沒錯 他有點小問題... - 小問題? 他不能扔球
Yes, he's had a little problem with... Little problem? He can't throw.
他的擊球率是.260 他的職業黃金期已經結束了
He's a career.260 hitter. The best part of his career is over.
- 我說才要開始 - 波士頓不想要他了
It's just getting started. Boston wants to cut him.
- 可沒人想揀他回去 - 這對我們是好事 他很便宜
No one wants to pick him up. Good. He's cheap.
讓我把事情搞清楚 你要簽一個
Let me get this straight. You're gonna get a guy
被半數棒球聯盟球隊放棄的人
that's been released by half the organizations in baseball
因為他的肘部受過不可治癒的 神經損傷導致他不能扔球
because he's got nonrepairable nerve damage in his elbow and can't throw.
他不能扔球又不能接防 他還能幹嘛呢
He can't throw and he can't field. But what can he do?
各位
Oh, boy.
查查你們的資料 否則我就問皮特了
Check your reports or I'm gonna point at Pete.
- 他能上壘 - 他能上壘
He gets on base. He can get on base.
- 他是保送次數多吧 - 他上壘次數多 洛克
So he walks a lot. He gets on base a lot, Rocco.
我需要在乎是保送還是安打嗎
Do I care if it's a walk or a hit?
皮特
Pete?
- 你不需要 - 我不需要
You do not. I do not.
比利我有37個比這三個傢伙 更好的自由球員
I got 37 free agents that are better than those three guys.
等一下 讓我再搞明白了
Wait a minute, let me get this straight.
就是說為了替換吉安比
So you're not gonna bring in one
你要簽下不止一個 而是三個次品球員
but three defective players to replace Giambi?
你不會是相信了比爾.詹姆斯 那套鬼話了吧
You're not buying into this Bill James bullshit?
這是奧克蘭運動家隊的新方向
This is the new direction of the A's.
我們是賭桌上的算牌客
We are card counters at the blackjack table
我們要贏過莊家
and we're gonna turn the odds on the casino.
- 我不懂 - 說到頭 夥計們
I don't see it. Seriously, guys.
我想我們需要記住 他是我們的帶頭人
I think we have to remember this is the man.
他只需對投資人和上帝負責
He answers to no one except ownership and God.
他沒必要對我們有交待
And he doesn't have to answer to us.
我們提建議 他來做決定
We make suggestions, he makes decisions.
既然這樣說 我們為了 讓這個俱樂部更好
That's all fine and well, but we've been working our asses off
嘔心瀝血了六個半周 你卻不屑一顧
for weeks to make this club better, and you're shitting all over it.
這不是在討論
This is not a discussion.
那我們在說什麼
What are we discussing?
貝瑞 不是討論
Barry, not a discussion.
比利 夥計
Billy, man, um,
我想你忘了一件事
there's one thing you're forgetting.
這三個人都不知道怎麼守一壘
None of those three guys knows how to play first base.
你得教他們中的一個
Well, you're gonna have to teach one of them.
教?
Teach?
教哪個
Which one?
這是西雅圖市區度假季的重頭戲
This is really the kickoff to the holiday season here in downtown Seattle.
這個盛事已經籌備了幾周 但一切等待都是值得的
It took weeks of planning to lead up to the big event, but it was well worth it.
天氣好極了 人們玩得高興
The weather was ideal. People are still haVing a great time.
成千上萬的人早早就出門了
Thousands of people were out earlier.
正在為你播報的是
We haVe a nice recap for you
在西雅圖市中心舉行的盛事
of all the great events taking place downtown in Seattle...
- 喂 - 斯科特嗎
Hello? Scott?

It's Billy Beane of the Oakland A 's. Yes.
- 可以談談嗎 - 當然
Can we talk? Uh, yeah.
你能讓我們進來嗎
Do you wanna let us in?
- 你說什麼 - 我們就在外面
Pardon me? We're out front.
- 什麼 - 在路邊
What? On the curb.
哦 好的 好的
Uh, yeah, yeah.
親愛的
Honey?
謝謝 謝謝 夫人
Oh, thank you. Thank you, ma'am.
真客氣
Very kind.
手肘好些了嗎 斯科特
How's the elbow, Scott?
挺好 很好 好極了
You know, it's good. It's really good. It's great. Uh...
- 我根本扔不了球 - 知道
I can't throw the ball at all. Yeah.
你最後一次扔球是從本壘板後面
You've thrown your last ball from behind home plate.
我就想這麼說
That's what I'd say. Well...
好消息是 我們要你守一壘
Good news is, we want you at first.
我們想要你當奧克蘭運動家隊的一壘手
We want you to play first base for the Oakland A's.
這個...
Okay, well,
我只當過捕手
I've only ever played catcher.
斯科特 你再也不是捕手了
Scott, you're not a catcher anymore.
如果你是 我們就不會是 唯一給你打電話的人了
If you were, our call wouldn't have been the only one you got.
- 對 聽著 我很感激你們的關注 - 不用謝
Yeah. Hey, listen, no, I appreciate it. You're welcome.
- 但問題是... - 你不知道怎麼守一壘
But the thing is, is... You don't know how to play first base.
- 斯科特 - 沒錯
Scott. That's right.
沒那麼難的 斯科特
It's not that hard, Scott.
- 告訴他 華叔 - 是非常難
Tell him, Wash. It's incredibly hard.
任何有意義的事都不容易 我們會教你的
Hey, anything worth doing is. And we're gonna teach you.
等一下 我是說 那...
Wait a minute here. I mean, but what about...?
傑森走了 斯科特
Jason's gone, Scott.
你們想要我取代吉安比的一壘位嗎
You want me to take Giambi's spot at first base?
- 沒錯 - 球迷會怎麼說
Yeah. What about the fans?
- 也許我也能教教他們 - 球迷不...說得好
Maybe I can teach one of them. The fans don't... Good one.
我的俱樂部不是由球迷經營
Fans don't run my ball club.
寶貝 你怎麼醒了
Honey, what are you doing awake?
親愛的 麻煩你...
Sweetheart, can you?
那是我女兒
That's my daughter.
你有孩子嗎
You got kids?
有 一個女兒
Uh, yeah, a daughter.
斯科特 這是為奧克蘭運動家隊打球的合約
Scott, this is a contract to play ball for the Oakland A's.
送了副本給你的經紀人
A copy's been sent over to your agent.
和你妻子商量一下 告訴我們結果
Discuss with your wife, let us know.
謝謝
Thank you.
再見
Bye-bye. Bye.
- 哦 對了 斯科特 - 嗯？
Oh, and, Scott. Yeah?
不要告訴任何人一壘的事情
Don't tell anyone about the first-base thing.
好的 先生
Yes, sir. Okay.
- 假期愉快 - 好的
Happy holidays. All right.
- 嗨 莎倫 - 你好 比利
Hey, Sharon. Hi, Billy.

Is she ready? She's out with friends.

Good. Really good. Things are peaceful around here.
見到你真好
It's good to see you.
謝謝 艾倫
Thanks, Alan.
賽季結束後我就沒見過你了
I haven't got to see you since play-offs.
我得說紐約是個傷心地
I wanted to say that New York was heartbreaking.
對你而言肯定如此
I'm sure for you too.
沒幾支球隊能拼到那兒 看到你打進去了 真是...
Not many teams make it that far, and to watch you go that far was...
- 確實幹得不錯 - 謝謝褒獎
It was really an accomplishment. Well, that's nice.
球隊準備得怎麼樣了
How is the team shaping up?
- 不錯 正在重組 - 很好啊
Team's good. Rebuilding. Good.
我看報紙上說你失去了吉安搏比和戴蒙
I read you lost Giambonni and Damon.
- 是吉安比 - 吉安比
Giambi. Giambi.
沒錯 還有戴蒙和伊斯林豪森
Yeah. Damon, Isringhausen.
- 他們真的...走了? - 走了 不是新鮮事了
They're really...? They're gone? Gone. Yesterday's news.
- 那太可怕了 - 沒有啦 但形勢的確嚴峻
That's terrible. No, but that is a tough situation.
真是...
That's...
不過你會好起來的 你總能把事情搞定
You're gonna be fine, though. You always figure something out.
- 她到哪兒 - 在街頭還是
Where is she? Where was she? Down the street or?
對不起 對 我剛打了她手機 她正要上山來
Oh, sorry, yeah. I just talked to her on her cell. She's coming up the hill.
好吧
Okay.
她有手機了?
She's got a cell phone?
- 是的 - 12歲就配手機?
Yeah. A 12-year-old?
是的
Yeah.
哈
Huh.
以防萬一
For emergencies.
家長的重大決定
Big parenting decision.
但那是...我們...那個 我們應該一起討論的事
But it's something that, you know, we, you know, all should discuss,
如果你有任何反對意見...
because if you have any objections, of course...
我和她媽媽會商量的
Her mother and I will discuss it.
但謝謝你
But thank you.
有喜歡的嗎
Any of these? Um...
我不知道
I don't know.
這個不錯
Do you...? This one's cool.
好還是不好啊
Is that good or bad?
- 蝴蝶 - 看起來不錯
Butterflies. They're okay.
看 那個好看 我喜歡紅色的
Look, that one's pretty. I like the red.
我們試試?
Should we try?
不要嗎
No?
- 我喜歡這個 - 是嗎
Oh, I like this one. Yeah?
爸爸 你看這個
Dad, look at this one.
- 看它的紅色 - 真漂亮
Look how it's red. It's beautiful.
- 這個好看 - 我們來試試
This one's pretty. Let's try it out.
就在這兒嗎
Just right here? Why don't we go over there?
去那好嗎
Can we go over there?
Lenka 「The Show」
親愛的 你唱出來吧 唱得那麼好
Oh, honey, you need to sing. That's so good.
真好聽
That's beautiful.
我有時也會唱
Sometimes I sing.
唱歌很有意思 但我不想讓別人聽到我唱歌
It's fun to sing with your song, but I don't want people to listen to me.
親愛的 我想人們會 喜歡聽你唱的 很好聽
Well, honey, I think people would love to listen to you. That's beautiful.
可以為爸爸唱一小段嗎
Would you sing a little for your dad?
就在這裏 商店裏
Right here in the middle of the store?
- 就唱幾句 - 就幾句
Little bit. Little bit.
- 準備好了嗎 - 好了
You ready? I'm ready.
好吧
Okay.
* 我有點左右兩難 *
* I'm just a little bit Caught in the middle *
* 生活是座迷宮 愛是個謎 *
* Life is a maze And love is a riddle *
* 我不知道該去哪兒 我無法獨自完成 我努力了 *
* I don't know where to go Can't do it alone, I've tried *
* 我不知道為什麼 *
* And I don't know why *
* 我只是個迷失在此刻的小女孩 *
* I'm just a little girl Lost in the moment *
* 儘管害怕但我卻不流露 *
* I'm so scared But I don't show it *
* 我沒有辦法 快被擊垮 *
* I can't figure it out It's bringing me down *
* 我知道我得放手 *
* I know I've got to let it go *
* 好好享受這場秀 *
* And just enjoy the show **
比利.賓恩第一輪選秀就獲選
Billy Beane was taken in the first round of the amateur draft.
1984年
我想有人要把比利.賓恩搶走
I think this is a steal, to get Billy Beane.
他年輕 有才能
He's young, he's talented.
一個速度型的五項全能球員 他是不容錯過的潛力股
A true fiVe-tool player with speed. This guy is a can't-miss prospect.
這對紐約大都會來說是個很好的跡象
This is a great sign for the new York Mets.
說不定就是他們一直在尋求的轉機
And it could be the turnaround that they'Ve been looking for.
壞球
Ball one.
我看好比利.賓恩
I'll take Billy Beane oVer Strawberry.
比利.賓恩做了個有意思的選擇 他拒絕了獎學金
Billy Beane, an interesting pick, turned down a scholarship.
他本來可以去斯坦福大學唸書
He could'Ve gone to Stanford.
有時你要到了大聯盟才會明白
Sometimes you don't find out till you get to the big leagues...
好球
Strike!
這個傢伙從來沒有失敗過 他高中剛畢業
This guy has never failed at anything. He's coming out of high school.
比利本來要去上大學 他可以成為一名出色的橄欖球四分衛
Billy was gonna go to college. He could'Ve been a great quarterback.
三振出局
Strike three.
任何一個棒球球隊
There's not an organization in baseball
都願意把寶壓在這個年輕人身上
who would not haVe taken a chance on this young guy.
1985年
他沒成功 每年都有這樣的例子
He didn't pan out. That happens every year.
有些成功 有些失敗了
Some do, some don't.
我是說 如果你對這個決定還不確定...
I mean, if you're haVing any doubt at all about this...
1986年
1987年
關於獎學金的...
HaVing the scholarship...
你兒子有天賦
Your son was born with a God-giVen ability.
很少有球探能探知一個年輕人的想法
Few scouts can go into the mind of a young man
來判斷他是否真的對自己的能力有信心
and determine whether he's really confident about what he can do.
一個很特別的球員
A Very special player.
所以你可以根據他的能力簽約
So you can sign him based on his ability,
之後他就得成功得自信起來
but then he's gotta be successful to be confident.
1988年
他一旦有了自信 你就有盼頭了
And once he becomes confident, that's when you'Ve got something.
1989年
你根據眼見的做出決定
You make a decision on what you see.
如果不成功 你就得往前看
And if things don't pan out, you moVe on.
這就是棒球
That's baseball.
很多人聽到了召喚 那能被選中的卻是個別
Many are called, few are chosen.
比利 這是凱文.尤克裏斯 被稱謂「希臘保送之神」 （尤克力斯是希臘名 他上壘率極高）
Billy, that is Kevin Youkilis. That is the Greek God of Walks.
他是我的偶像
That's my hero.
他得到的保送上壘次數 是除了貝瑞.邦茲以外
That man gets walked more than anybody in baseball
最多的
except for Barry Bonds.
去年6月我試圖說服史派羅簽下他
I tried to convince Shapiro to pick him up last June,
但他說他走路搖擺像只鴨子
but he said he waddled like a duck.
結果波士頓搶走了他
Yeah, Boston snagged him.
我想他們是想觀望一下
I think they wanna wait and see.
- 你還好嗎 比利 - 比利
Are you okay, Billy? Billy?
我們可以談談嗎
Can we talk?
可以 好的
Yeah. Yeah.
你不開心 格雷迪 怎麼了
You're unhappy, Grady. Why?
哇
Wow.
- 我可以直話直說嗎 - 當然 說吧
May I speak candidly? Sure, go ahead.
全美職業棒球大聯盟和它的粉絲 會很樂意把你和谷歌小子
Major League Baseball and its fans, they're gonna be more than happy
扔到巴士車輪下
to throw you and Google Boy under the bus
如果你照目前這樣行事的話
if you keep doing what you're doing.
你不能用電腦去組隊
You don't put a team together with a computer.
- 不能嗎 - 不能
No? No.
棒球不只是數字 不是一門科學
Baseball isn't just numbers. It's not science.
如果是的話 任何人都能做我們的工作 但其實他們做不到
If it was, anybody could do what we're doing, but they can't.
他們不知道我們所知的
They don't know what we know.
他們沒有我們的經驗和直覺
They don't have our experience and our intuition.
好吧
Okay.
你就靠那個有耶魯大學 經濟學學位的小孩
You got a kid in there that's got a degree in economics from Yale.
你面前則是有29年棒球經驗的球探
You got a scout here with 29 years of baseball experience.
你選錯了參謀對像
You're listening to the wrong one.
有些難以捉摸的因素只有內行才懂
Now, there are intangibles that only baseball people understand.
你要低估球探們干了150年的活路嗎
You're discounting what scouts have done for 150 years?
甚至包括你自己
Even yourself?
適應環境 否則死路一條
Adapt or die.
這是因為你自己的經歷 是不是
This is about you and your shit, isn't it?
20年前 有個球探看錯人了
Twenty years ago, some scout got it wrong.
- 哇 行了 行了 - 你現在是向傳統正式宣戰了
Whoa. Okay. Okay. Now you declare war on the system.
好了 好了 該我說兩句了 你沒有水晶球
Okay, okay, my turn. You don't have a crystal ball.
要看著一個人就能預測他的未來 你的本事也不會比我強多少
You can't look at a kid and predict his future any more than I can.
我和你一起坐在那些餐桌邊
I've sat at those kitchen tables with you
聽你跟家長們說 「到時候了我自然就知道」
and listened to you tell parents, "When I know, I know.
「你的兒子行不行 我一眼就能看出來」
And when it comes to your son, I know."
其實你做不到
And you don't.
你做不到
You don't.
好了 我才不在乎什麼友情
Okay. I don't give a shit about friendship,
不管現在 還是從前
this situation, or the past.
全美職業棒球大聯盟和我思路一致 你不會贏的
Major League Baseball thinks the way I think. You're not gonna win.
我要給你一個免費建議
And I'll give you a nickel's worth of free advice.
在你帶我們參加完這個慘敗的賽季 並被老闆開除後
You're never gonna get another job
你將再也找不到工作
after this catastrophic season you're about to set us all up for.
你將不得不向你的孩子解釋
You'll have to explain to your kid
你為什麼在迪克運動用品店工作
why you're working at Dick's Sporting Goods.
我不會炒你魷魚的 格雷迪
I'm not gonna fire you, Grady.
- 操你媽的 比利 - 現在我開了你
Fuck you, Billy. Now I will.
祝你好運 艾特
Good luck, Art.
久保田 你從來沒打過棒球 對嗎
Kubota. You never played ball, right?
- 打過一點少年棒球 - 你來當首席球探
I played a little T-ball. You're the new head scout.
恭喜
Congratulations.
所以波士頓隊正在觀望？
So Boston's gonna wait and see?
對
Yeah.
就你和我 皮特
Yeah. It's just you and me, Pete.
我們開始吧
And we're all in.
春季訓練
聽起來好像你在為他們的行為道歉
It sounds like you're apologizing for what they're doing.
我沒有 我只是不明白
I'm not. I just don't know what you're gonna do
你能用運動家隊的 預算做什麼 你會買誰
with the budget that the A 's haVe. Who are you gonna get?
我看了春季訓練的名單
I'm looking at the spring-training roster.
- 你簡直在開玩笑 - 怎麼了
You gotta be kidding me. How so?
他在那兒就像個小丑
He looked like a clown out there.
- 誰 - 查德.布拉德福
Who? Chad Bradford.
布拉德福情況如何
Tell me about Bradford.
我挺喜歡他的 不過他不是外行
I like him a little bit, but he's a specialist.
你不可能騙他說 "第八局就看你的了
He's not a guy that you say, "The eighth inning is yours,
左撇子對右撇子"
lefties Vs. Righties."
這是我的看法
In my opinion.
我不知道比利.賓恩和 管理層是怎麼看他的
I don't know what Billy Beane and management understands about him.
但他的投球時速只有82 83碼 總得有點別的…
He only throws the ball about 82, 83 miles an hour. There must be something...
他是個怪胎 這可不是在誇他
He is a freak, and not in a good way.
我來問問你
Let me ask you this.
如果想在分區賽裏獲勝
Talking about trying to win a diVision.
我們指望大衛還寶刀未老
We're counting on DaVid to be the guy he was.
但我有點懷疑 他已經老了
I haVe my doubts. He's gotten old.
所以他不在紐約隊 也不在克利夫蘭隊 他無處可去
That's why he's not in new York anymore, not in cleveland anymore.
我們本該給強尼.戴蒙的錢 卻給了這個廢物
We paid him the money we should'Ve been giVing to Johnny Damon.
傑瑞米.吉安比
Hey. Jeremy Giambi.
他才是我們要擔心的人
That's the one to worry about.
他去賭城的時間比在奧克蘭更多
He gets comps up and down Vegas more than in Oakland.
這應該讓你警醒啊
That should tell you something right there.
到底要這些傢伙幹嘛啊
Isn't that the deal with these guys?
他就閃光了一年
He has one good year.
然後得到一筆豐厚的身價 接著就被轉會
And he gets a huge offer and then he gets traded.
- 鮑勃 加力 - 哈特伯格
Bob. Harder. Hatteberg.
好 很好
Good. Good.
比利 我們得談談哈特伯格的事
Billy, we haVe to talk about Hatteberg.
- 說吧 - 他在一壘還是沒感覺
Go. There's just no feel for the spot.
我覺得他離大聯盟一壘手 還有很長距離
I think it's a long shot that he can be a big-league first baseman.
這才是第一周第一天 你不能就斷定了
It's day one of the first week. You can't judge this yet.
不 我覺得我們可以斷定了
No, I think we can judge it.
我喜歡他 你知道 不過我還是可以斷定
I mean, I like him, you know, but I can judge him.
一壘對他來說遙不可及
First base is the moon to him.
吉安比就沒被看臭啊 吉安比當初是最差的一壘手了
It wasn't to Giambi. Giambi's the worst first baseman in baseball.
- 你拿他跟吉安比比嗎 - 說什麼呢
Gonna compare him to Giambi? What are we talking about?
好吧
All right.
你覺得呢 華叔
What do you think, Wash?
說好聽點是他缺乏自信
The nice way to say it is he lacks confidence.
那就給他自信
Well, give him some.
我會的 不過我們還有佩納 他能打一壘
I'll do that, but we got Pena, who can play first.
而且他狀態很好
And he's looking mighty good out there.
就用哈特
We wanna go with Hattie.
還有六周時間
We got six weeks.
用心點
Get down in it.
- 很好 - 斯科特.H
There you go. Scotty H.
- 就是這樣 - 撿球好手啊
That's what I'm talking about. Picking machine.
就是棒球而已
It's only baseball.
這事最好行得通
This better work.
逗你的啦
I'm just kidding you.
* Don't stop belieVin' *
上啊 奧克蘭
Let's go, Oakland!
上啊 奧克蘭
Let's go, Oakland!
* Streetlight **
- 這東西怎麼回事 - 要一美元 哥們
What is wrong with this thing? It's a dollar, man.
- 什麼 - 歡迎來奧克蘭 D.J
What? Welcome to Oakland, D.J.
真是搞笑
Oh, you gotta be shitting me.
我想今年的比賽 會證明團隊才會勝利
I think this year, we're gonna show that it takes a team to win,
而不是靠某個人 是團隊
not any individual guy, just a team.
我覺得我們隊很強
And I think we got a hell of a ball club here.
查德 你今天覺得有壓力嗎
Chad, are you intimidated at all today?
不能說有壓力 真的 我就是挺興奮的 就像你說的
I wouldn't say I'm intimidated, really. I'm just really excited, like you said.
傑瑞米.吉安比 沒有了你哥哥傑森 這支球隊要如何取勝
Jeremy, how's the team gonna fare without your brother, Jason?
就目前來說 球隊找到了新人填補空缺
Well, you know, the organization did a great job
做得挺成功的
of bringing in good young guys to fill that role.
說實話 運動家是便宜價買到的你
Let's face it, they're getting a deal with you.
洋基隊卻高價買了傑森
The Yankees are paying Jason a lot of money.
你在這裏的酬勞只有那麼點 你感受怎樣
You are coming here on a dime. How does that make you feel?
我感覺很好 呃...
I feel good. Um...
- 你手指的情況如何 - 就那樣
How are the nerves in your fingers? You know.
我們說說年齡吧 你36歲了
Gotta start with the age, 36 years old.
你覺得自己的身體 能撐過一個賽季嗎
How do you think your body's gonna hold up?
你在脫衣舞吧和狂歡上花了大把時間
You spend a lot of time at strip clubs, partying.
你對在場下受到的關注覺得惱怒嗎
Do you resent the attention you get off the field?
不啊 我喜歡
I love it.
- 你經常在賭城打混 - 是的
You spend a lot of time in Vegas. I do.
- 我感覺很好 就像我說的 做了很多準備… - 抱歉 請你別擋著我的鏡頭
I feel great. I did a lot of work to get... Excuse me. Get out of my shot.
抱歉 請說
Sorry, go ahead.
對於我的年齡
There have been questions about my age
和所謂的技能下滑 你們有很多疑問 不過我會證明自己的
and my declining skills, some say, but I'm here to prove that wrong.
我是問你百分百確定嗎
I asked if you were 100 percent.
- 抱歉 賓恩先生 - 嗨 查德
Excuse me, Mr. Beane? Hey, Chad.
- 我沒打擾你吧 - 沒有 怎麼了
Hey, I'm not disturbing you, am I? Not at all. What's up?
我想感謝你給我這個機會
I wanted to say thank you for this opportunity.
很高興你能成為我們的隊員 我們都會獲益匪淺的
Well, we enjoy having you. It's gonna work out well for all of us.
我很感激 先生 從來沒人給我打大聯盟賽的機會
I appreciate it, sir. Nobody's ever given me a chance like this before.
從來沒有?
Nobody?
只有你 先生
Well, just you, sir.
噢 這會成為大日子 你永遠不會忘的
Well, it's a big day, one you won't forget.
非常感謝 我就想說
Appreciate it. And I wanna let you know
我會為你和你的家人祈禱
I'm gonna be praying for you and your family.
好的
No problem.
現在離奧克蘭運動家隊 2002年的開賽只剩幾分鐘
Well, here we are just minutes away from the season opener of 2002 for the Oakland A's.
第一局比賽即將開始
The first pitch is moments away.
奏國歌時我們再回來
We'll come back with the national anthem.
請別走開 今天就是開幕日
Opening day is upon us.
- 好了 夥計們 茄子 - 好了
All right, fellas, smile. Here we go.
* Hey, she giVe me loVe And I feel all right now **
我進去了 比賽詳情用短信告訴我
I'm going in. Text me the play-by-play.
什麼 為什麼
What? Why?
我不看比賽
I don't watch the games.
小隊 立定
Detail, halt!
And forward face!
首發佩納 不是哈特伯格嗎
這是德州游騎兵今天第三支安打
That's the third Ranger batter to be hit today.
因阿歷克斯.羅德裏格斯失誤 已經丟兩分了 第九…
Twice Alex Rodriguez was nicked. The ninth...
從一開始我就應該認真和你談談
I should've made you a bigger part of the conversation from day one.
你就會更清楚我們的計劃
It'd be clear what we're trying to do.
這是我的錯 艾特 這是我的責任
That was my mistake, Art. I take responsibility for that.
你想說什麼
What are you trying to say?
我要說 如果你不按計劃用人 我怎麼安排都沒用
Doesn't matter what moves I make if you don't play the team the way they're designed to be.
比利 這你管不著
Billy, you're out of your depth.
- 為什麼哈特伯格不在一壘 - 因為他守不了一壘
Why not Hatteberg at first? Because he can't play first.
- 你怎麼知道 - 這又不是我指導的第一場比賽
How do you know? Not my first baseball game.
- 斯科特.哈特伯格不能打擊 - 他能上壘
Scott Hatteberg can't hit. He gets on base.
對我們來說依然利多於弊 再贏7場 我們的勝率就超過五成了
Still keeps us in the plus column. We need to be seven over.500.
怎樣
What?
還有什麼事
Anything else?
還有最後一局我想看到布拉德福投球 而不是麥格納迪
Yeah. I would've rather seen Bradford in the end than Magnante.
布拉福德是右手投手
Bradford's a righty.
- 我不在乎他左還是右 - 我在乎
I don't care about righty-lefty. I do.
- 這是因為你的合同嗎 - 不是
Could this be about your contract? No.
這有關你做你的事 我盡我的責
This is about you doing your job and me doing mine.
我的責任是全權帶這支
Mine's me being left alone
你給我組建的球隊
to manage this team you assembled for me.
- 我不是為你組建的 - 顯然不是
I didn't assemble them for you, Art. No shit.
會談愉快
Good meeting.
每次我們聊完
Every time we talk,
我對這棒球的熱血都油然重生
I'm reinvigorated by my love of the game.
我們聯繫到了格雷迪.富森 運動家隊前首席球探
We got Grady Fuson, former head of scouting with the Athletics.
格雷迪 你能給我們解釋下現在的情況嗎
And, Grady, can you interpret for us what's going on?
- 他們稱之為魔球 - 魔球?
They call it Moneyball. Moneyball?
對 這是個很好的理論 但就是沒起作用
Yes, and it was a nice theory, and now it's just not working out.
比利.賓恩組建的這支隊伍是基於 一個叫比爾.詹姆斯的人創建的理論
Billy Beane has built this team on the ideas of a guy, Bill James,
他寫了一本有趣的書 關於棒球統計學的
who wrote an interesting book on baseball statistics.
問題是比爾.山姆斯從未打過球 也沒管理過棒球隊
The problem is that Bill James never played, never managed.
其實他只是一家豬肉大豆公司的保安
He was in fact a security guard at a pork-and-beans company.
你覺得這是球隊的末日了嗎
Do you see this as a decimation of the organization?
我覺得他是自尋死路
He bought a ticket on the Titanic.
天啊
Oh, boy.
他想找個新的突破
He's tried to come up with a new approach.
我對他表示尊敬 但這行不通
My hat's off to him. It won't work.
兩好一壞 塔哈達三振出局
One-two pitch. Tejada strikes out.
比賽結束
And that is the game.
西雅圖水手隊兩場都贏了 雷
The Seattle Mariners win both games on this series, Ray.
他們連續贏了10場 目前西雅圖13勝3負
They'Ve won 10 in a row. Seattle is 13 and 3.
看不下去了
I can't watch this shit.
你跟隊員們一起上路比賽
Go on the road with the team.
你沒有跟他們比賽呢
You don't go on the road with the team.
- 所以叫你去 - 你為什麼不去
That's why I want you to do it. Why don't you?
我不能跟他們有私人情誼
I can't develop personal relationships with these guys.
這樣才能狠下心來把他們賣了
I gotta be able to trade them, send them down,
甚至解雇
sometimes cut them.
這你也得學學
Which is something you should learn to do, by the way.
我永遠不會解雇隊員啊 除非你…
I would never have to cut a player, unless you...
- 拜託 - 拜託什麼啊
Oh, come on. "Come on" what?
- 我們練習下 - 不干
Let's practice. No.
就要 我是個球員 你要解雇我
Yeah. I'm a player. You gotta cut me from the roster.
- 不 - 快
No. Go.
- 你說什麼不啊 - 不
What do you mean, no? No.
- 快點 - 這太蠢了
Do it. This is stupid.
這是工作的一部分 夥計
Part of the job, man.
好吧
Fine.
比利 請坐 我要和你談談
Billy, please have a seat. I need to talk to you for a minute.
繼續
Go on.
你一直是隊裏的重要成員
You've been a huge part of this team.
但有時你必須要為全隊著想
But sometimes you have to make decisions for the team.
我想你懂的
I'm sure you can understand.
- 你要解雇我? - 非常抱歉
You're cutting me? I'm really sorry.
我剛在這裏買了個房子
I just bought a house here.
- 呃 - 就在奧克蘭
Well... In Oakland.
唔 呃…
Well, uh... Well...
"呃... 呃..." 你就說得出這個嗎
"Well... Well..."? That's all you got to say?
我的孩子剛進入新學校
My kid just started a new school.
- 他們剛交到朋友 - 那個…
They made friends. That's, uh...
你不要在學期中打斷他們
You shouldn't pull them out in the middle of the year.
- 你應該等等 - 你在說些什麼鬼啊
You should wait. What the hell are you talking about?
我不知道 我沒法…
I don't know. I shouldn't have...
我不會這麼做的 我覺得這太傻了
I'm not gonna do this. I think this is stupid.
我不會開除任何人 這個練習太傻了
I'm not gonna fire anybody, and this is dumb.
他們是職業球員 直接告訴他們就是
They're professional ballplayers. Just be straight with them.
不要閒扯 就說事實
No fluff, just facts.
皮特 我得讓你離開 傑克的辦公室會負責細節
Pete, I gotta let you go. Jack's office will handle the details.
- 就這樣? - 卡
That's it? Pfft.
真的嗎
Really?
你是想腦袋直接中槍 還是胸口中五槍流血致死?
You rather get a bullet to the head or five to the chest and bleed to death?
只有這兩個選擇啊
Are those my only two options?
跟球隊出去比賽吧
Go on the road with the team.
好吧
Okay.
喂 夥計
Say, bro.
- 問你個問題 - 好的
Let me ask you a question. Yeah.
你老闆怎麼不跟球隊一起出門
How come your boss doesn't travel with the team?
他不喜歡跟球員打成一片
He doesn't like to mingle with the players.
是為了開除我們時不尷尬嗎
Is that supposed to make us easier to cut?
我不知道 我不清楚
I don't know. I don't know.
還有 為什麼俱樂部裏的汽水 還要付一美元
And how come soda is a dollar in the clubhouse?
我從來沒見過這種事
I never seen nothing like that.
比利想把錢花在球場上
Billy likes to keep the money on the field.
省汽水那點錢嗎
Soda money?
真的嗎
Really?
我買汽水的一美元在球場的什麼地方呢
Where on the field is the dollar I'm paying for soda?
這是很難說清楚
It's hard to see exactly,
- 不過的確在那呢 - 嗯 是很難看到
but it's there, yeah. Yeah, it is hard to see.
我沒事了
I'm done.
- 嘿 老爸 - 嗨 親愛的
Hey, Dad. Hi, honey.
- 你好嗎 - 很好
How are you? I'm good.
- 中途顛簸嗎 - 還好啦
Was it bumpy? It was okay.
我們依然為你驕傲
加上今晚的失敗 奧克蘭運動家隊
So with this loss tonight, the Oakland Athletics
在17場比賽裏輸掉了14場 難以置信
incredibly, haVe lost 14 of their last 17 games.
在美聯西區已落後頭名10場勝差
They are 10 games back in the American League West.
可以說實驗失敗了嗎
Is it fair to say the experiment has failed?
當然 這早可預見的
Well, absolutely. It was predictable.
沒人希望別人失敗 但事實擺在眼前
You don't wish anybody a lack of success, but the facts are in front of you.
這不能怪艾特.哈爾
You can't blame Art Howe.
是的
No.
現實就是 這跟統計沒關係 這是人的比賽
The fact of the matter is, this is not about statistics, this is about people.
艾特.哈爾不是問題
Art Howe is not the problem.
- 大失敗 - 問題是總經理室裏的比利.賓恩
The problem is in the general manager's office with Billy Beane.
在我看來 問題的根源很明晰
The root of the problem for me is philosophical.
我之前就說了 那是想像中的棒球
I said it before. This is fantasy baseball.
比利完全沒經過大腦思考
Billy is just not thinking.
應該考慮換個新經理 做點改變
Start thinking about a new GM, making changes.
他從來不看比賽
He never goes to the games.
這結果顯而易見
This was Very predictable.
他應該看看場上的情況
He needs to look at what's going on.
- 他應該認真起來了 - 我要比利.賓恩下台
The man needs to get real. I want Billy Beane gone.
賓恩的腦袋 有人找 你到底在想什麼
Calling for Beane's head. I want your thoughts.
之前的18場比賽裏 有4場被完封或只得1分
The past 18 games, they'Ve been shut out or scored one run four times.
他們得分太低了
They're just not scoring enough.
不光是打擊進攻的問題 不是薩德.波士力（教練）和打者的問題
It's not just the offense, not Thad Bosley and the hitters.
一切都有問題 如果只是某個問題 還可以試圖補救
It's everything. If there was one thing you could pick out, you'd try to fix it,
但這支隊完全陷入低潮
but just everything is in a funk right now.
我到底在做什麼
What the hell am I doing?
天啊
Oh, man.
你看 史蒂夫
Look, Steve.
我對我們在做的事很有信心
I believe in what we're doing.
我覺得數據不能反映 這支隊伍的實力
The record doesn't reflect the strength of this team
也不代表賽季末我們能獲得的成績
or where we're gonna be at the end of the season.
我和皮特都堅信 我們要繼續堅持原來的方針
Now, Pete and I here feel very strongly that we stay on the track we've chosen.
我們之前的樣本數據還不夠 這…
Our sample size has been too small. It's too...
還早 下定論還早
Early. It's still early.
到全明星賽停賽期前 我們預期可以到什麼水平
Where do we expect to be by the All-Star break?
我們的目標和我們的預期
Our goal and our expectation
是到7月中和頭名的勝差在7場以內
is by mid-July to be within seven games of first.
一切會有好轉
That would be this working.
- 到時我們還有機會趕上 - 會好得出乎意料
That keeps us in the hunt. Exceptionally well.
- 到7月 - 7月
By July. July.
那還有什麼阻礙你們 達成那個目標的嗎
And what's gonna prevent you from accomplishing that?
你們在擔心什麼
What are you afraid of?
沒有 所以我們才在這裏 史蒂夫
Nothing. That's why we're here, Steve.
那就是我們每天忙活的事 我們一直在努力的
That's why we get up in the morning. That's all we do.
- 再來點? - 對 再多點
More? Yeah, a little more.
- 別告訴媽媽 - 不會的
Don't tell your mother. I won't.
- 巧克力醬? - 好
Chocolate sauce? Yes.
夠了
Stop.
- 要大勺子還是小勺子 - 小的
Big spoon or little spoon? Little spoon.
謝謝
Thank you.
爸 你不會丟了工作吧
Dad, there's no way you're gonna lose your job, right?
什麼
What?
沒有啦
Well, I don't know.
- 我就是想想… - 你從哪聽來的
I'm just wondering. Where'd you hear that?
我有時會上網
Well, I go on the Internet sometimes.
不要 別上網
Well, don't do that. Don't go on the Internet.
別看新聞 別看報紙
Or watch TV or read newspapers
或是聽別人瞎說
or talk to people.
我不跟人聊天 就是看點東西
I don't talk to people. I just read stuff.
親愛的 一切都很好 沒問題的
Honey, everything's fine. Everything's fine.
真的 你不用擔心
Really, you don't have to worry.
但如果你丟了工作 你不是得搬走了?
But if you lose your job, will you have to move away?
甜心 我不會丟了工作的
Honey, I'm not gonna lose my job.
你別擔心
You don't have to worry.
- 好的 - 喂
Okay. Hey.
- 沒問題的 - 好的
There's no problem. Okay.
好嗎 我有一堆麻煩 但都不是問題
All right? I got uptown problems, which are not problems at all.
你不擔心 是吧
You're not worried, right?
- 我沒擔心 - 好
No, I'm not worried. Okay.
還是佩納
Pena.
好吧
Okay.
我要戴守右外野
I want Dye in right,
賈斯蒂斯指定代打 佩納後補
Justice DH'ing, Pena on the bench,
哈特伯格守一壘
Hatteberg at first,
要麥格作為首發投手
and anyone but Mags first out of the pen.
你要佩納坐板凳？
You want Pena on the bench?
正是 這樣你才能用哈特
That's right. So you can play Hattie.
佩納不僅是隊裏最好的一壘手
Pena is not only the best first baseman,
而且是我們唯一的一壘手
he's the only first baseman.
哈特上壘率比佩納高多了
Hattie gets on base more than Pena.
- 實際上是高20% - 但他的守備呢
In fact, 20 percent more. And his fielding?
他的防守無關緊要
His fielding does not matter.
- 這話我聽得夠多了 - 是嗎
I've heard enough of this. Have you?
而且我…
And I, uh...
簡單說 我不同意
I disagree with you, plain and simple.
還有 我這樣帶隊
And moreover, I'm playing my team
明年冬天述職的時候才說得清楚
in a way that I can explain in job interviews next winter.
好了嗎
Okay? Ahem.
用哈特 不要佩納
Hattie. Not Pena.
What's up, skip?
- 你怎樣 - 很好 你呢
How you doing? Good, how you doing, man?
昨晚睡得好嗎
Get some sleep last night?
運動家隊上場了 準備開始比賽
As the A 's hit the field, we are ready for baseball.
第一個走出休息區的 是新星卡洛斯.佩納
First one out of the dugout is rookie sensation carlos Pena,
本隊選手裏稀有的希望 他站到了一壘位置上
one of the few bright lights in this lineup, taking his spot at first base.
* Down, gettin' down There's a whole lot of rhythm *
比利 一個小問題 你是否期望這些隊員有更好的…
Billy, quick question. Do you expect these guys to produce more or...?
- 現在不行 夥計們 - 成績暴跌的原因是什麼
Not now. What's the reason for the slump?
* We gotta haVe the funk *
* Ow, we want the funk *
* GiVe up the funk *
* Ow, we need the funk *
* We gotta haVe the funk **
下來
Get down.
輸球很有趣嗎
Is losing fun?
- 輸球很有趣嗎 - 不
Is losing fun? No.
那你在尋什麼樂子
What are you having fun for?
這聽起來才像輸球
That's what losing sounds like.
你沒事吧 爸爸
Are you okay, Dad?
- 你又來了 - 什麼
You're doing it again. What?
你在擔心我
You're worrying about me.
你們隊墊底了 爸爸
You're in last place, Dad.
- 我看起來憂慮嗎 - 對
Do I look worried? Yeah.
那是因為你要坐飛機 這東西經常往下掉
Because you're getting on an airplane, and those things crash all the time.
請不要操心你老爹了
Please stop worrying about your dad.
- 都安排好了 - 好
We're all set. Okay.
- 我愛你 - 我也愛你
I love you. Love you too.
好了 你爸爸沒問題
All right. Your dad's not in trouble.
好啦
Okay.
好吧
Yeah.
- 蘇珊 給我聯繫艾德.韋德（費城費城人隊經理） - 好
Suzanne, get me Ed Wade. Okay.
- 咖啡好了嗎 - 是的
Coffee on? Yes.
- 早上好 - 早上好 比利
Good morning. Good morning, Billy.
嗨 路易莎
Oh, hi, Louisa.
- 比利.賓恩想與艾德.韋德通話 - 嗨
I need Ed Wade for Billy Beane. Hi.
請稍候
Please hold.
- 什麼事啊 - 韋德在2線
What's up? Wade's on 2.
- 艾德 - 喂
Ed? Hello?
- 艾德 是我比利 - 比利 怎麼了
Ed, it's Billy. Billy, what's up?
- 聽著 我需要找防守球員 - 好的
Look, I need a little help on defense. Okay.
我願意用傑瑞米.吉安比來交換
I'm willing to trade Jeremy Giambi for it.
- 真的嗎 - 什麼
Really? What?
嗯 你手頭有誰
Mm-hm. Who you got? What?
- 讓我想想 - 你幹嘛
Well, let me think. What are you doing?
清理門戶
Cleaning house.
- 梅布利怎樣 - 或許怎樣
Mabry? Maybe what?
- 我是說梅布利 - 稍等
No, Mabry. Hold on.
- 不行 - 為什麼
No. Why not?
你不能賣掉傑瑞米.吉安比
Because you can't trade Jeremy Giambi.
就他了 艾德
He'll be fine, Ed.
為什麼我覺得你在佔我便宜
Why do I get the feeling you're picking my pocket?
我沒有 你才佔我便宜 光吉安比這名字都值更多
I'm not. You're picking mine. Giambi's name alone is worth more.
- 他有什麼問題 - 他沒問題
What's wrong with him? Nothing.
所以這算是說好了 開始做文件了?
Can we say it's done in theory and start drawing up the paperwork?
- 好吧 不過你得… - 好極了
Okay, but you're gonna haVe... Great.
他還想說話
He was gonna say something else.
得到想要的回答就掛電話
When you get the answer you're looking for, hang up.
- 蘇珊 - 在
Suzanne. Yes?
- 接大衛.東布羅夫斯基（底特律老虎隊） - 好
David Dombrowski. Okay.
- 佩納也得走 - 我覺得你不能這麼做
And Pena's going too. I don't think you should do that.
我真的覺得你不能這樣
I really don't think you should do that.
我要哈特伯格今晚就上場
I want Hatteberg in the lineup tonight.
比利 我想你應該等一等
You need to take a minute.
我真的覺得你要想清楚在做什麼
I think you seriously need to think about what you're doing.
- 因為你很不爽 - 好吧
Because you're upset. Okay.
我有什麼沒想到的
What am I missing?
這些決定很難向人交待
These are hard moves to explain to people.
有問題嗎 皮特
Why is that a problem, Pete?
別意氣用事 比利
Don't make an emotional decision, Billy.
大衛.東布羅夫斯基在3號線
David Dombrowski's on 3.
聽著 我們要做就做決了
Look, we're gonna shake things up.
大衛 佩納要公開出售了 我第一個通知你
Dave. Pena's going on the block. You're my first call.
因為他讓本隊其他人顯得很蠢
Because he's making the rest of the team look bad.
他會得今年的新人獎哦
He's gonna be a Rookie of the Year.
- 說不定可以入選全明星陣容 - 他會進全明星 大衛
Probably an All-Star. He's an All-Star, Dave.
不 我要後援投手加現金
No. I want a reliever and cash.
好吧 給你5分鐘 大衛 過時不候
Okay. You got five minutes, Dave. I'm not waiting.
比利 佩納是全明星的料啊
Billy, Pena is an All-Star, okay?
如果你賣掉他 而哈特伯格 這招又沒成功 你知道這…
And if you dump him and this Hatteberg thing doesn't work out, you know this is...
這種決定足以讓你丟掉工作
This is the kind of decision that gets you fired.
真的
It is.
對 你說的對
Yes, you're right.
我可能丟掉工作
I may lose my job.
而我44歲的人 只有高中文憑
In which case I'm a 44-year-old guy with a high school diploma
我還想送我女兒讀大學
and a daughter I'd like to be able to send to college.
你25歲 有耶魯學歷
You're 25 years old, with a degree from Yale
還有很棒的工作經驗
and a pretty impressive apprenticeship.
我們並沒有問對核心問題
I don't think we're asking the right question.
我想我們應該問的是
I think the question we should be asking is,
你相信我們的選擇嗎
do you believe in this thing or not?
我信
I do.
你覺得我們還需要 向別人解釋的話就錯了
It's a problem you think we need to explain ourselves.
不解釋 無論對誰
Don't. To anyone.
明白
Okay.
我要堅持到底了 無論結局好壞
Now, I'm gonna see this thing through, for better or worse.
你只要告訴我 你分析一壘是用 哈特伯格更有勝算 還是佩納
Just tell me, do you project we'll win more with Hatteberg or Pena at first?
結果很接近…
It's close...
不過理論上哈特伯格更好
but theoretically, Hatteberg.
那我們還廢什麼話
What are we talking about, then?
東布羅夫斯基又打來了 在3線
Dombrowski's on again, on 3.
喂
Yeah?
好 可以
Okay, that'll work.
很好 還有一件事
Great. I need one more thing.
汽水 對 我不想讓自己的球員再 花錢買汽水
Soda. Yeah, I don't want my guys paying for soda.
我要你給我的汽水機補貨三年
I want you to stock my machine for three years.
我是認真的
I'm serious.
好極了 說定了
Great. It's a deal.
去告訴佩納 讓他打包走人
Go tell Pena he's gotta pack.
- 你要我去告訴佩納嗎 - 這是工作的一部分
You want me to tell Pena? Part of the job.
吉安比呢 也要我去說嗎
What about Giambi? You want me to tell him too?
我來
I'll tell him.
- 打擾下 卡洛斯 - 什麼事
Excuse me, Carlos? Yeah?
- 我能和你談兩句嗎 - 好的
Can I speak with you a minute? Yeah.
卡洛斯 你被轉會到底特律老虎隊了
Carlos, you've been traded to the Tigers.
這是傑.帕爾瑪的電話
This is Jay Palmer's number.
他是球隊的差旅管理秘書
He's the traveling secretary for the team.
他正等你的電話 他會處理其他一切事宜
He's expecting your call. He'll take care of everything.
- 就這樣了? - 對
Is that it? Yes.
好吧
Okay.
好了
Okay.
艾特 你現在有空嗎
Art, you got a minute?
嗯 坐吧
Yeah. Take a seat.
今晚你不能首發佩納上一壘了 你要用哈特伯格
You can't start Pena at first tonight. You'll have to start Hatteberg.
我不想再扯這個話題 比利
I don't wanna go 15 rounds, Billy.
組織陣容的是我 廢話少說
The lineup card is mine, and that's all.
當然 組織陣容的是你
That lineup card is definitely yours.
我只是說一壘不能用佩納了
I'm just saying you can't start Pena at first.
哦
Well...
我就要讓他去一壘
I am starting him at first.
我想不行了 他現在為底特律效力了
I don't think so. He plays for Detroit now.
你換走了佩納？
You traded Pena?
沒錯
Yeah.
還有曼納奇諾 希爾吉斯 塔姆會被解聘了
And Menechino, Hiljus, Tam are all being sent down.
- 你瘋了 - 是哦 我是瘋子
You are outside your mind. Yeah. Cuckoo.
- 你想見我? - 對 傑瑞米 坐吧
You wanted to see me? Yeah, Jeremy, grab a seat.
傑瑞米 我把你換到費城人隊了
Jeremy, you've been traded to the Phillies.
這是艾德.韋德的電話 他是球隊經理 是個好人
This is Ed Wade's number. He's a good guy, the GM.
你給他打電話吧
He's expecting your call.
布德會幫你訂飛機
Buddy will help you with the plane flight.
你是個好球員 傑瑞米
You're a good ballplayer, Jeremy,
祝你好運
and we wish you the best.
傑瑞米也走了
Jeremy's gone too.
你要毀了這個球隊
You're killing this team.
艾特 我可以一直這麼做下去
Art, I can do this all day long.
嘿
Hey.
你對此毫無異議?
You agree with this?
絲毫沒有
Hundred percent.
想要關上門嗎
You want this door closed?
- 斯科特.H - 是的 先生?
Scotty H. Sir?
- 去接滾地球吧 - 好的
Go field some grounders. Yes, sir.
大家聽好了
Everybody, listen up.
也許你們看起來不像冠軍隊
You may not look like a winning team...
但你們就是
but you are one.
所以...
So...
今晚打出冠軍樣子來
play like one tonight.
要命了
Oh, shit.
當擊到你喜歡的球時 你的打擊率是.625 相當驚人啊
When you're getting your pitch, you're hitting.625, massive.
你能把球打爆
You're crushing the ball.
但當你亂揮...不挑你擅長內角正中球時
But when you swing at things... Your pitch is middle-in.
而是揮棒擊的是低點外角球 你的打擊率只有.158
When you're swinging low and away, you're batting.158.
每個打數都像21點的一張牌
Every at bat's like a hand of blackjack.
每發完一張牌 局勢都可能翻盤
Every card that's dealt, your odds change.
所以一旦第一個好球沒擊中 你的擊球率就下降75個點
So every first-pitch strike, your batting average goes down about 75 points.
75個點啊
Seventy-five points.
對方投手應該在第五局前投出100個球
He should throw 100 pitches before the fifth.
你們得把首發投手給累趴下 讓他在牛棚裏起不來
You wanna knock that starter out.
我要你們在系列賽收關時從十個 甚至11個投手那拿足打數
I want you taking at bats off the 10th and 11 th pitcher by the end.
這裏的統計分析顯示了
This is your basic breakdown of the pitches,
你的所有理想擊球點 以及詳細原因
where you should be hitting them, why.
- 所以你是要我們更多得被保送嗎 - 問得好 是的
So you want us to walk more? Good question. Yes.
賈斯蒂斯先生
Mr. Justice.
- 我有些想法 - 是嗎
Had a few thoughts. Yeah?
- 是的 - 想教我什麼嗎
Yeah. Gonna teach me some things?
什麼
Excuse me?
從來沒見過經理 那樣跟球員講話
Never seen a GM talk to players like that.
你也沒見過當過球員的經理吧
You never seen a GM who was a player.
哈
Huh.
- 有什麼問題嗎 大衛 - 不 沒什麼
We got a problem, David? No, it's okay.
我知道你的套路
I know your routine.
這是來軟的 為了達到效果
It's patter. It's for effect.
但這一套對他們好用 對我沒用
But it's for them, all right? That shit ain't for me.
那你很特殊咯
Oh, you're special?
你每年給我700萬美元 所以 是的
You're paying me 7 million bucks a year, man, so, yeah,
也許我是有點特別
maybe I am, a little bit.
不 夥計 我沒給你700萬
No, man, I ain't paying you 7.
洋基隊負擔了你一半薪水
Yankees are paying half your salary.
這就是紐約洋基隊對你的態度
That's what the New York Yankees think of you.
他們給你350萬美元 讓你來做他們的對手
They're paying you $3.5 million to play against them.
你到底想說什麼 比利
Where you going with this, Billy?
大衛 你37歲了
David, you're 37.
不如我們坦白點 說說彼此想要什麼
How about you and I be honest about what each of us want out of this?
我要榨干你最後一滴棒球能力
I wanna milk the last ounce of baseball you got in you.
而你想留在賽場上
And you wanna stay in the show.
我們合作吧
Let's do that.
我不是為你曾經的輝煌給你錢
I'm not paying you for the player you used to be.
而就是看上現在的你
I'm paying you for the player you are right now.
你很聰明 你明白我們想做什麼
You're smart. You get what we're trying to do here.
給年輕人做個榜樣吧
Make an example for the younger guys.
當個領導者
Be a leader.
你能做到嗎
Can you do that?
好吧 我知道了
All right. I got you.
我們之間沒問題了吧
We're cool?
沒問題
We're cool.
斯科特.H
Scotty H.
- 你好嗎 D.J. - 撿球機器哈
Yo, what's up, D. J? Picking machine.
喜歡一壘嗎 夥計
How you liking first base, man?
有進展吧 繼續撿球吧
It's coming along. Picking it up.
你知道 轉變很困難 不過我感覺越來越好了
You know, tough transition, but I'm starting to feel better with it.
- 是嗎 - 嗯
Yeah? Yeah.
你最怕什麼
What's your biggest fear?
任何朝我飛來的棒球
A baseball being hit in my general direction.
很好笑 說真的 是什麼
That's funny. Seriously, what is it?
真的 就是這個
No, seriously, that is.
嘿 那祝你好運啊
Well, hey, good luck with that.
要多社交啊
Be social out there.
- 社交 - 社交 就像GAP的迎賓員
Social. Social. Like a greeter at the Gap.
有人跑到你的地盤 就和他聊聊
Guy steps into your office, chat him up.
你讀過書 上過學
You're well-read. You went to school.
- 對 - 開心點 放鬆
Yeah. Have some fun. Relax.
每個人都想進攻 不要老想進攻
Everyone wants to attack. Quit trying to attack.
讓比賽跟著你的節奏走 這東西不限時間的
Let the game come to you, man. There's no clock on this thing.
這是個消耗戰
This is a war of attrition.
我可以多放過點球 甚至放過好球 被保送上壘的幾率也越大
If I take more, I could even take a few strikes, but I'll get walked more.
只要上壘 我們就贏 上不了 我們就輸
You get on base, we win. You don't, we lose.
我討厭輸球 查威 我討厭
And I hate losing, Chavvie. I hate it.
比起想贏 我更討厭輸
I hate losing more than I even wanna win.
這是有區別的
And there's a difference.
- 不要觸擊短打 - 短打就意味著一人出局
No bunts. Bunts is an out.
- 就算三壘手後退也不行嗎 - 不管怎樣也不要短打
Even if the third baseman is back? No bunting whatsoever.
如果對方犧牲短打 直接撿球扔給一壘
If someone bunts on us, throw it to first.
別逞英雄了想雙殺
Don't be a hero and go to second.
等著敵人犯錯誤
Let them make the mistakes.
你敵人犯錯時 絕對不要打擾他們
When your enemy's making mistakes, don't interrupt them.
他們是在給你機會 讓你踢他們出局
They're giving you an out. Just giving it to you.
抓住機會 道謝就好
Take it. Say thank you.
還有一件事 不要盜壘
Another thing. No more stealing.
但我就擅長盜壘 你雇我來就是讓我盜壘
That's what I do, what you pay me to do.
我雇你來為了站上一壘 不是為了被接殺在二壘
I pay you to get on first, not get thrown out at second.
這是個過程 過程 知道嗎
This is a process. It's a process, it's a process. Okay?
傑森（洋基的吉安比）接住球 扔給二壘 一出局 運動家隊得一分
Jason takes it, goes to second for the only out, and the A 's get a run.
傑邁恩.戴又一支全壘打 這是他兩場比賽中的第二支了
Jermaine Dye homers again, his second in two games.
運動家隊還在堅持 這裏是目前的積分 （2002年6月6日）
And the A 's are still hanging in. We'll get you scores here.
運動家隊和天使隊的勝差被拉近了 只差2場就能有機會爭奪外卡
The A 's pull within two of the Angels for the wild-card chase.
紅襪隊現在已連輸5場
The Reds haVe now dropped fiVe in a row
在這場系列賽一開始就被奧克蘭隊 以5比3領先

塔哈達被保送了
Tejada walks.
四壞球
Ball four.
四壞球 哈特伯格被保送上壘
Ball four and Hatteberg walks.
奧克蘭發生什麼了 運動家隊已連續贏了7場
What is happening in Oakland? The A 's haVe won seven in a row.
真是令人興奮 這是勝勢如潮啊
A lot of excitement. What a winning streak.
會不會是艾特.哈爾穩住了軍心
But how about the calming influence of Art Howe?
如果不是指我或者皮特 那你指的消息來源就完全不知所謂
When you say "your source," if it's not me or Peter, they don't know.
他帶領著一個不同尋常的隊伍
He's managing an unorthodox team.
- 對 - 這陣容並不出色
Right. It's not a perfect roster.
但現在艾特.哈爾才是 這支隊伍勝利的原因
But right now, Art Howe is the reason this team is winning.
- 他值得這樣的褒獎 - 好 謝謝 再見
He deserves the credit. Great, thanks. Bye.
你聽見了嗎
Did you hear that?
我聽到"連續贏了7場" 你拿到克利夫蘭隊的攻防名單了嗎
I heard "seven in a row." You get the Cleveland matchups?
對 就在這裏
Yeah, right here.
- 布斯 - 比利
Voos. Billy.
- 這裏的味道更難聞了 - 我這就處理
That smell is getting worse. I'm on it.
- 今晚怎麼打算 - 各半怎麼樣
What are we doing? Splitting it in half?
- 左右兩邊都要 - 好的
Both sides of the plate. Got it.
- 赫迪 記得變換球路 - 好的 先生
Huddy. Mix it up. Yes, sir.
- 相信你的旋轉球 - 好的
Trust your slider, yeah? Yes, sir.
你們別再讓他分心了
You guys quit distracting him.
你昨晚不該急著打那些爛球啊
You couldn't hit that shit last night with a paddle.
多等幾球嘛
You gotta see more pitches.
- 好的 比利 - 要有耐心
All right, Billy. Patience.
- 嘿 大衛 - 嘿 比利
Hey, David. Hey, Billy.
- 打得好 - 謝謝
Great at bats. Thank you.
很有質量
Really quality. Thank you.
右外野安打 塔哈達得分
Base hit to right field. Tejada scores.
查韋斯也跑回本壘了 球飛過了蓋爾
ChaVez coming in. The ball gets past Guiel.
運動家隊以5比0落後 反超6比5領先
The A 's, from 5-nothing down, now lead 6 to 5.
投手生涯紀錄
現在奧克蘭運動家隊簡直是脫韁野馬
The Oakland A 's are completely out of hand at the moment.
美國聯盟後援投手
他們獲得17勝4負 是美聯本月最好的成績
They are an AL-best 17 and 4 this month.
他們在波士頓和紐約也接連獲勝
They also took back-to-back series at Boston and at new York.
還記得六月時他們將傑瑞米.吉安比 賣給費城人隊嗎
Remember when they traded Jeremy Giambi in June
所有人都認為他們放棄了
and everyone thought they'd just giVen up?
其實正相反
Actually, not so much.

- 韋納夫羅換邁克爾森 - 安德森 - 我是說安德森 我都不知道他叫什麼
Venafro for Michaelson. Anderson. I don't know his name.
- 我考慮下 - 好好考慮 給我電話

Totally agree. We just need them to cool on Rincon.
- 飛利浦在2線 - 史蒂夫 是我比利
Phillips on 2. Steve-o, it's Billy.
我聽說你想要左手後援投手 我可以給你韋納夫羅
I hear you're looking for a reliever. I can give you Venafro.
- 簡單了當 - 你有啥企圖
I can make it quick and easy. What's the angle?
- 沒企圖啊 - 那你想拐跑誰
No angle. Who am I getting fleeced for?
- 等等 - 本納特怎麼樣
Hang on a sec. Uh, Bennett, maybe?
- 年齡 - 26
How old? Twenty-six.
26歲 還在2A（培養後備的小聯盟） 不行

鄧肯 不行
Duncan, no.
不行 弗布什 不行
No. Furbush, no.
艾肯特怎麼樣 就
Eckerton? Eckerton? Eckerton.
Eckerton.
- 我喜歡艾肯特 - 你根本都不知道他是誰
I like Eckerton. You don't even know who Eckerton is.
- 韋納夫羅受傷了嗎 - 沒有 他很好
Is Venafro hurt? No, he's fine, he's fine.
只是我們內部有點問題
It's just an issue for us.
- 之前兩次 他投球都被擊飛了 - 不是他的問題
Last couple times, he got hammered. Not his fault.
- 是我們的問題 策略錯誤 - 是史蒂夫
That was us. We misused him. It's Steve.
- 就快好了 - 史蒂夫.莎特（老闆）
I'm almost done. Steve Schott.
- 請稍等 他在打電話 - 聽著史蒂夫 我直接跟你說吧
Look, Steve-o, let me be straight with you.
是這樣的 我要了林康 已經談好了
Here's the deal. I'm getting Rincon. It's a done deal.
- 但我聽說巨人隊… - 不 巨人隊想用邁克爾森換韋納夫羅
I heard the Giants... Giants want Venafro for Michaelson.
- 是安德森 - 我寧願換給你
Anderson. I'd rather deal with you.
你可以給我艾肯特和22.5萬現金
You can give me Eckerton and $225,000 in cash,
巨人隊什麼都沒有
and the Giants can't.
- 我會考慮一下 - 考慮吧
I'll think about it. Think about it.
不過誰先回我電話 韋納夫羅就歸誰
But whoever calls me back first gets Venafro.
莎特（老闆）掛了
Schott hung up.
我一定要成功
Oh, I want this one.
為什麼沒人打來啊
Why isn't anybody calling?
史派羅在2線
Shapiro's on 2.

好 我跟老闆談談 然後回你電話 謝謝
Okay, let me talk to my owner. I'll call you back.
- 接史蒂夫的電話 - 莎特（老闆）還是飛利浦（大都會）
Get Steve on the phone. Schott or Phillips?
我幹嗎要打給飛利浦 應該是他打給我們
Why would we call Phillips? Phillips has gotta call us.
告訴他 我還在打電話
Tell him I'm on the other line.
嗨 莎特先生 我是皮特.布蘭德 很抱歉要你等候
Hi, Mr. Schott, it's Peter Brand. I apologize for putting you on hold.
- 比利叫我回你電話 他還在打電話 - 說我們要22.5萬買林康
Billy asked me to call you back. Tell him we want 225,000 for Rincon.
比利說他要22.5萬買裏卡多.林康
Billy says he needs $225,000 for Ricardo Rincon.
請你

Yes, I added the "please" at the end.
好吧 我...請稍等一下
Okay. Let me... Hold on one second, please.
告訴他 我來給錢
Tell him I'll pay for him.
但如果明年我把他賣了雙倍價錢 那還得歸我
But when I sell him back for twice the amount next year, I keep the money.
好 比利說他自己付錢買林康
Okay, so Billy says he'll pay for Rincon himself.
但明年如果賣了高價 利潤都歸他了
But when he sells him for more money next year, he's keeping the profit.
非常感謝 我們再打給你 謝謝
Thank you very much. We'll call you back. Thank you.
來啊 再來
Come on. Come on.

Suzanne, call Shapiro ba... Never mind, I got him right here.
馬克 是我

Listen, I don't want Rincon pitching against me tonight.
告訴他換隊服 送他過來 錢準備好了
Tell him to change clothes and send him over. I got you the money.
對
Yup.
太好了
Great.
我不想破壞氣氛 但我們有了林康...
I don't wanna dampen the mood at all, but since we picked up Rincon...
就要踢某個人出局了
We gotta send someone down.
- 麥格 - 嗨 比利
Mags. Hey, Billy.
我知道最近我有點吃力
I know I've been struggling lately.
但下半賽季一定有改善的 裏奇和我想到…
But second half of the season, definitely turn it around. Ricky and l...
麥格 不要再整裝了
Mike, I need you to stop getting dressed.
我被賣了?
Traded?
很抱歉帶給你壞消息
I'm sorry for the crap news.
我知道這很痛苦
I know it hurts.
麥格 球隊裏不能有26個人
Mike, I can't have 26 guys in the clubhouse.
我知道 我知道
I get it. I get it.
好的 謝謝
Okay. Thanks.
嘿 裏卡多
Hey, Ricardo.
- 你好 先生 - 你好
這一定讓你吃了一驚吧
This must be a bit of a shock, I guess.
梅布利擊中一球 球飛進中右外野
Mabry hits one deep to right-center field.
跑者已跑回本壘 菲克接不到了
Racing back, Fick can't get it.
球彈到得分牌板上 一個跑回本壘 兩個跑回本壘
It bounces to the wall. One run is in. Two runs are in.
梅布利一球之間 就給運動家隊帶來領先
Mabry, on one pitch, has shot the A 's in front.
三振 運動家隊連勝12場了 （連勝）
Strike three called. TwelVe straight wins for the Athletics.
天呢 太不可思議了
Man aliVe, was it hairy.
奧克蘭出了怪事了
Something strange is now happening in Oakland.
- 現在分數無可置疑了 - 連勝12場
You cannot argue that point.  TwelVe straight.
他們讓美國棒球聯盟成了笑話
They're making a joke out of the American League.
- 他們今天在底特律 - 他傳給一壘
They were in Detroit today...  He throws to first.
這就是14連勝的歡呼
And that's the sound of 14 straight Victories.
14勝 這是今年的最高記錄
Fourteen, the longest run this year.
運動家隊已經攀升到美聯西區第一名 勝利一發不可收拾
It has slingshot the A 's into first in the AL West. A nice streak.
這支球隊曾經一度被無情抨擊
This team was written off.
如何解釋他們取得的驚人勝利
How do you explain, otherwise, the Victories they'Ve come up with?
奧克蘭運動家隊贏得了16場連勝
The Oakland A 's are gonna win 16 consecutiVe games.
這是25年來棒球界最長的連勝記錄 觀眾們
This is the longest win streak in baseball, folks, in 25 years.
運動家隊已經連勝16場了
The A 's haVe won 16 in a row.
我們要20連勝 20連勝
We're going to 20! We're going to 20!
要連續贏到現在 隊伍一定很優秀
To haVe a winning streak of this duration, you haVe to be good,
但這裏面也有偶然性
but there's an element of randomness to it.
1927年的洋基隊 有路德 蓋瑞格 還有殺手打線（給當年洋基隊強大陣容的昵稱）
The 1927 Yankees, Ruth, Gehrig,
至今仍有人認為是最優秀的陣容
Murderers' Row, some people still say the best team ever.
他們當年最長的勝利是多少 9連勝
Longest winning streak for them that year? Nine.
你想用一系列的觀點來分析這事
You guys try to analyze it from a numbers standpoint.
我告訴你 現在發生的事 無法解釋
I'm telling you, there is no explanation for what's occurring right now.
你是用了什麼巫術嗎
Do you haVe superstitions going on?
你做了什麼才能保持連勝的?
Do you do things so you keep the streak aliVe?
破紀錄的20連勝看起來 並非不可能
The all-time record of 20 does not seem impossible anymore.
今天運動家隊上了紐約時代雜誌
The A 's were on page one of the New York Times.
他們是整個國家體育界的傳奇
They are the story in sports in this entire country.
兩好兩壞 看這個
Two-two pitch, here it is.
揮棒落空 三振出局 第17勝
Swing and a miss! Struck him out! Number 17!
用71年了
It's taken 71 years.
奧克蘭運動家隊平了費城人隊的紀錄

空前絕後的17連勝記錄
The all-time franchise record 17 straight
自1953年以來 棒球史上最長的連勝記錄
and baseball's longest winning streak since 1953.
還差兩場 運動家隊就能平了美聯記錄了
The A 's are two wins away from tying the American League record.
飛出去了 飛出去了 塔哈達全壘打 你們能相信嗎
It's gone! It's gone! Tejada wins it! Do you believe it?
連勝18場
Eighteen wins in a row!
你們可以重複看那18次比賽100遍
You could replay these 18 games a hundred times oVer.
沒人能再次連勝18場
And nobody wins 18 straight again.
這顛覆了我們對棒球所有的觀念
It defies everything we know about baseball.
過去4天裏 大體育場裏發生了
The most amazing thing you could imagine
你能想像到最神奇的事
happened oVer the last four days at the coliseum.
塔哈達 直飛中野 運動家隊連勝19場了
Tejada, up the middle. The A 's haVe won 19 in a row!
1906年的白襪隊
The 1906 White Sox,

運動家隊與勝利有約
The A 's haVe a date with destiny.
他們直奔美國聯盟賽的記錄而去
They're going for the all-time American League record,
連勝20場
20 games in a row.
我們要20連勝 我們要把聯賽記錄刷新到20連勝
We're going to 20! We're gonna take the AL record to 20, baby!
2002年 9月4日
別告訴我分數 皮特
Don't tell me the score, Pete.
不 比利 是我
No, Billy, it's me.
- 莎倫嗎 - 是的
Sharon? Yeah.
- 你有時間嗎 - 有 怎麼了
You haVe a second? Yeah, what's up?
我倒沒想到你會接起來
Well, I didn't actually expect you to pick up.
本來想留個口信的
I was gonna leaVe a message.
凱西和我 我們在家正在看比賽
Um, casey and I, we're here and watching the game at home.
我想告訴你
And I just wanted to say...
你做得很棒 比利
you did good, Billy.
我們為你驕傲
We're really proud of you.
謝謝 莎倫
I appreciate it, Sharon.
- 謝謝 - 祝你好運
Thank you. Good luck.
嗯
Okay.
凱西想跟你說話 等等
Oh, casey wants to talk to you. Hang on.
你正在去運動場的路上嗎
Are you on your way to the stadium?
不 我正要去維賽利亞 去看我們的小聯盟賽隊 （附屬於大聯盟隊伍輸送後繼隊員）
No, I'm on my way to Visalia to see our minor-league team.
- 快掉頭啊 爸爸 - 沒門兒
Turn around, please, Dad. No way, Jose.
- 掉頭吧 拜託 老爸 - 不 不行
Turn around. Come on, Dad. Nope. Not gonna happen.
你不會帶去厄運啦
You're not gonna jinx it.
回頭再聊 甜心 我愛你
I'll talk to you later, sweetheart. I love you.
媽的
Shit.
第四局一人出局 如果你剛轉到這個頻道
One out here in the fourth, and if you're just joining us,
你錯過了很多精彩啊
you missed a lot.
輪到保羅.依賓尼茲擊球 一好球
And the pitch to Raul Ibanez. Strike one.
我的簡述很簡單
I think my recap will be simple.
運動家隊第一局得了6分 第二局1分 第三局4分
The A 's scored six in the first, one in the second, four in the third.
你說得這樣輕巧 聽到的人會吃驚啦 哈哈哈
And people would be shocked if you just did that. Heh-heh-heh.
11比0 運動家隊領先
Eleven to nothing, the A 's do lead.
- 媽的 - 界外 好球…
Shit. Foul off the foot of Ibanez...
衝啊 奧克蘭
Let's go, Oakland!
衝啊 奧克蘭
Let's go, Oakland!
衝啊 奧克蘭
Let's go, Oakland!
現在上場擊球 2號 捕手布蘭特.梅恩

number 18, left fielder Raul Ibanez.
安全回壘
Safe.
現在運動家隊以11比3領先
And the A 's now lead by a score of 11 to 3.
緩衝下是不錯 但不應該給對手機會
A nice cushion, but you don't wanna giVe teams life
不能讓他們有翻盤的機會 即使領先…
and let them wedge their way back in, even when you're...
沒人出局 滿壘
Nobody out, the bases loaded.
艾特.哈爾正走向投手丘 要作投球調整
And Art Howe on the way to the mound to make a pitching change.
這場比賽的局面仍然可能
And this game is still in a state
超出運動家隊的掌控
where it could get out of control for the Athletics.
某個時刻 總會有人告訴我們 不能再玩小孩子的遊戲
We're all told at some point we can no longer play the children's game.
只是不知道會是何時
We just don't know when that's gonna be.
可能是在18歲 可能是在40歲 但我們總會有那個時刻
Some of us are told at 18, some of us are told at 40, but we're all told.
現在是麥克.斯維尼打擊 一壘三壘有人
Mike Sweeney with runners at first and third.
現在比分11比7 運動家隊領先
It's an 11-to-7 game, the A 's in front.
塔姆等著投手手勢
Tam peering in for the sign.
兩人出局 一三壘有人
Two out. Runners at first and third.
兩好三壞（球數已滿 下一球要麼 三人出局此局結束 要麼極可能得分）
And the 3-2 deliVery.
（這球是全壘打 這樣一三壘有人 意味著一下子得三分）
這太怪了比利
It's weird, Billy.
你想放棄打棒球 去當球探？
You wanna giVe up baseball to become a scout?
我不是棒球球手
I'm not a baseball player.
你確定這是你想要的嗎
Are you sure this is what you want?
人群在咆哮 肯什準備好了 兩好一壞
The crowd is roaring. Koch is ready. One-two pitch.
阿里西亞打出去了 弧線飛到左外野 一支安打
Alicea puts it in play, a looper to left field for a base hit.
跑過三壘 直衝本壘 平分了
Around third, tearing for the plate, here comes the tying run.
滑壘成功 雙方11分平
Sliding safe. And the ball game is tied at 11-all.
上帝啊
Holy Toledo.
運動家隊浪費了11比0的領先優勢
The A 's haVe blown an 11-to-nothing lead.
自從皇家隊在第四局得到5分後
This is the specter of a development that has been lurking now
人們心頭的恐慌開始蔓延了
ever since the fiVe-run fourth inning by the Royals.
運動家隊與勝利的約會出現停滯了
And the A 's date with destiny is on hold right now.
哈特伯格 哈特
Hatteberg. Hattie.
拿上球棒 你代布蘭納斯擊球
Grab a bat. You're hitting for Byrnesy.
快點 動起來 去熱身
Come on, let's go. Get yourself loose.
埃裏克.布蘭納斯代打
Hitting for Eric Byrnes,
10號 斯科特.哈特伯格
number 10, Scott Hatteberg.
按運動家隊慣常的風格 派了能上壘的人上場
In your typical A 's fashion. They want a base runner here.
斯科特.哈特伯格擅長得四壞球保送
Scott Hatteberg is so adept at drawing walks.
教練是想讓哈特伯格上壘
He's looking for Hatteberg to get on base,
再換代跑
maybe bring in a pinch runner.
上啊 奧克蘭
Let's go, Oakland!
上啊 奧克蘭
Let's go, Oakland!
球飛出去了（全壘打)
That one is gone!
這是奧克蘭運動家隊 第20場連續勝利
And it's 20 consecutiVe Victories for the Oakland Athletics
在這個不可思議的夜晚
on an unbelieVable night
他們失去了11比0的優勢之後
when they lost an 11-to-nothing lead
最後大獲全勝
and now they win it.
人群重新陷入瘋狂
The crowd comes back to insane life.
這是不解之迷啊
How do you explain it?
瘋了 完全是瘋了
Crazy. Just plain crazy.
哈特伯格在本壘上被大家包圍
Hatteberg is mobbed at home plate.
在美國棒球聯盟103年的歷史上
In 103 years of American League baseball,
運動家隊的勝利前無古人
the Athletics haVe accomplished what no one has before.
他們連續贏得了20場勝利
They haVe won 20 consecutiVe games.
你沒法不愛上棒球
It's hard not to be romantic about baseball.
這種盛事 是球迷的狂歡
This kind of thing, it's fun for the fans.
票房大賣 熱狗售罄
It sells tickets and hot dogs.
但毫無意義
Doesn't mean anything.
比利 我們剛連勝20場啊
Billy, we just won 20 games in a row.
所以呢
And what's the point?
我們創造了記錄
We just got the record.
夥計 我做這行已經…
Man, I've been doing this for...
聽著 夥計
Listen, man.
我在這一行的時間很長了
I've been in this game a long time.
我不是為了紀錄來的 告訴你
I'm not in it for a record, I'll tell you that.
我不是為了冠軍指環
I'm not in it for a ring.
這種時候 總有人付出代價
That's when people get hurt.
如果最後一場冠軍賽我們輸了
If we don't win the last game of the Series,
他們照樣不會在意我們
they'll dismiss us.
- 比利... - 我瞭解這些人
Billy... I know these guys.
我知道他們的想法 他們會抹平我們的成就
I know the way they think, and they will erase us.
我們做的一切
And everything we've done here,
對他們都毫無意義
none of it'll matter.
其他任何球隊贏了冠軍賽都是件好事
Any other team wins the World Series, good for them.
他們會開香檳 獲得冠軍戒
They're drinking champagne, they get a ring.
但如果我們贏了
But if we win,
用這樣的預算 這樣的球隊
on our budget, with this team...
我們就改變了一切遊戲規則
we'll have changed the game.
這才是我要的
And that's what I want.
我要這事留下意義
I want it to mean something.
奧克蘭運動家隊 帶著西區冠軍頭銜進入季後賽
The A 's going to the play-offs with the West DiVision title.
他們還未大肆慶祝 這情有可原
ForgiVe the A 's if they're not celebrating.
他們之前也走到過這裏
They haVe been here before,
就在去年 運動家隊在美聯季候 分區賽還連贏過洋基兩場
when Oakland went up two games to none on the Yanks in the ALDS,
之後卻直輸三場 鎩羽而歸
and went nowhere after losing three straight.
今天贏了雙城隊 奧克蘭隊將在1992年後
With a win today oVer the Twins, Oakland moVes into the ALcS
第一次挺進美聯冠軍賽
for the first time since 1992.
但記住一件事
But remember one thing.
整個賽季的打擊率可以很高 可是就一場比賽 一個打輸而言
Percentages hold up oVer a season, but for one game, one at bat,
打擊率沒有任何意義
throw the percentages out the window.
明尼蘇達雙子隊揭露了 奧克蘭運動家隊的真相
What the Minnesota Twins exposed is the fact that the Oakland A 's
他們終究不是一支實力堅挺的球隊
were fundamentally not a sound baseball team.
從球隊經理到智囊團都頂著一個
They had a flawed concept that started with the general manager
錯誤的觀念 就是他們可以改變棒球規則
and the brain trust thinking they could reinVent baseball.
不能用空中樓閣的統計概念
You can't approach baseball
來詮釋棒球運動
from a statistical, bean-counting point of View.
勝利需要通過實打實的比賽才能獲得
It's won on the field with fundamental play.
你得盜壘 短打 犧牲
You haVe to steal, you haVe to bunt, you haVe to sacrifice.
你得讓隊員站上得分位 再送他們回來
You gotta get men in scoring position, and you gotta bring them in.
這不是用一堆統計學的花招就能換來的
And you don't do that with a bunch of statistical gimmicks.
沒有人可以改寫遊戲規則
Nobody reinVents this game.
是我
Yeah.
我無意小看奧克蘭主場 不過這才是真正的棒球場
Due respect to the Coliseum, but this is a ballpark.
沒錯
Yes, it is.
一會兒一起吃午飯吧
We're gonna have some lunch in a little bit.
我準備點咖啡
Why don't I have some coffee sent up?
Denise?
謝謝你 丹尼斯
Thank you, Denise.
- 謝謝 - 沒關係
Thanks. You're welcome.
你知道 她生日到了 我應該送她生日禮物
You know, it's her birthday and I need to get her a present,
但通常她才是幫我挑禮物的人
but she's usually the one that does that for me.
你有什麼提議嗎
So do you have any ideas?
圍巾
Scarf.
你是說羊毛的?
You mean like wool?
不 我是指女人用作飾品的那種
No, I meant what women wear with... You know, decorative.
啊 我到哪兒去買這個啊
Ah. And where would I get something like that?
我不想失禮 但我已連續兩年輸掉分區賽
No disrespect, I just lost in five for the second year in a row.
我只想送她只保齡球
Get her a bowling ball for all I care.
說得也是
Right.
史蒂夫告訴我他已經提出了續約
Well, Steve told me he's offering you a new contract.
是的
Yes.
那你為什麼要回我電話
So why did you return my call?
因為這是紅襪隊
Because it's the Red Sox.
因為我相信科學可以破解貝比魯斯的魔咒 (1920年紅襪隊貝比魯斯被賣後詛咒 紅襪隊無法再得全國冠軍)
Because I believe science might offer an answer to the Curse of the Bambino.
- 因為我聽說你僱傭了比爾.詹姆斯 - 對
Because I hear you hired Bill James. Yup.
為什麼要這麼久才有人僱傭他 我真想不通
You know, why someone took so long to hire that guy is beyond me.
棒球界不喜歡他
Well, baseball hates him.
是的 棒球界可以討厭他
Well, baseball can hate him, you know.
錢的一大好處就是可以買很多東西
One of the great things about money is that it buys a lot of things,
這種奢侈包括了 不用管棒球界喜歡什麼
one of which is the luxury to disregard what baseball likes,
棒球界不喜歡什麼 它怎麼想 不怎麼想
doesn't like, what baseball thinks, doesn't think.
聽起來很爽
Ah. Sounds nice.
Well...
我很感激你的來電
I was grateful for the call.
- 你很感激? - 對
You were grateful? Yeah.
你用4100萬美元組建了決賽球隊
For 41 million, you built a play-off team.
你失去了戴蒙 吉安比 伊斯林豪森 佩納
You lost Damon, Giambi, Isringhausen, Pena,
然後你贏的比賽 比他們在的時候更多
and you won more games without them than you did with them.
你贏的比賽跟洋基隊一樣多
You won the exact same number of games that the Yankees won,
但洋基隊每場勝利平均花費1400萬美元
but the Yankees spent 1.4 million per win,
而你只付出了26萬美元
and you paid 260,000.
我知道你艱難得滴血 但第一個打破牢牆的人
I know you're taking it in the teeth, but the first guy through the wall,
總是會經受挫折的
he always gets bloody.
總是 這不僅威脅到整個經營模式
Always. This is threatening not just a way of doing business,
在他們的心目中 這威脅到整個運動理念
but in their minds, it's threatening the game.
真的 這威脅到他們的生存方式 他們的飯碗
Really, what it's threatening is their livelihood, their jobs.
威脅到他們做事的方式
It's threatening the way that they do things.
每次出現這種事
Every time that happens,
無論是政府行為 還是商業行為 無論是什麼
whether it's a government, a way of doing business, whatever,
手握掌控權的人
the people who are holding the reins,
可以一手遮天的人
they have their hands on the switch,
他們會發瘋
they go batshit crazy.
你看 那些不拆散現有球隊
I mean, anybody who's not tearing their team down right now
不按你的模式重組球隊的人
and rebuilding it using your model,
他們就是將滅絕的恐龍
they're dinosaurs.
今年10月 他們會坐在自家沙發上
They'll be sitting on their ass on the sofa in October
眼睜睜看著波士頓紅襪隊 贏得世界大賽冠軍
watching the Boston Red Sox win the World Series.
這是什麼
What's this?
我要你當我的球隊經理 這是我開的價
I want you to be my general manager. That's my offer.
注意啊
Heads up.
你幹嘛啊
What was that?
- 抱歉 我也不知道 - 你搞什麼啊
Sorry. I don't know. What the hell was that?
你個豬頭
You knucklehead.
波士頓之行如何
How was Boston?
印象深刻
Impressive.
亨利應該給了你很好的待遇吧
Did Henry make you a good offer, at least?
- 無關緊要 沒什麼的 - 是怎樣 是怎樣
Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter. What was it? What was it?
- 這無關緊要 - 到底是什麼
Doesn't matter. What was it?
你會是體育史上 薪水最高的經理啊
That makes you the highest-paid GM in the history of sports.
所以呢
So?
又怎樣
So what?
我曾經做過一個向錢看的決定
I made one decision in my life based on money.
我發過誓 絕不再犯
And I swore I would never do it again.
你這次不是為了錢
You're not doing it for the money.
- 不是嗎 - 不是
No? No.
你是為了這錢的意義
You're doing it for what the money says.
它代表著每個賺大錢的球員 都知道的意義
And it says what it says to any player that makes big money.
就是他們值得這個價錢
That they're worth it.
這都什麼屁話
What a dump.

維塞利亞的奧克蘭小聯盟隊
The Visalia Oaks
以及我們220斤的捕手傑瑞米.布朗
and our 240-pound catcher, Jeremy Brown,
你知道的 讓他跑二壘是要他命了
who, as you know, is scared to run to second base.
這是六周前的一場比賽
This was in a game six weeks ago.
這個人會投快球
This guy's gonna start with a fastball.
傑瑞米要把球打到中後方
Jeremy's gonna take him to deep center.
這是最有趣的地方了
Here's what's interesting,
因為傑瑞米打算做 他從沒做過的事
because Jeremy's gonna do what he never does.
他要拼了
He's gonna go for it.
他會繞過一壘 然後全力衝向二壘
He's gonna round first and he's gonna go for it.
準備好了嗎
Okay?
這簡直就是傑瑞米的噩夢成真
This is all of Jeremy's nightmares coming to life.
- 他們在笑話他 - 傑瑞米馬上就要知道為什麼了
Aw, they're laughing at him. And Jeremy's about to find out why.
傑瑞米意識到
Jeremy's about to realize
球飛出了圍欄60英尺遠
that the ball went 60 feet over the fence.
他打出了全壘打 而自己都沒發覺
He hit a home run and didn't even realize it.
你怎麼能不愛上棒球 （猛點頭）
How can you not be romantic about baseball?
- 這是在隱喻你 - 我知道是在說我
It's a metaphor. I know it's a metaphor.
好了
Okay.
皮特 你是個好人
Pete, you're a good egg.
我會打給你
I'll call you.
嘿 老爸 這是我說了會錄製的歌
Hey, Dad, this is the song I told you I'd record.
不要給別人聽啊
Please don't show it to anyone else.
如果你改變主意 留在加利福利亞 記得告訴我
Let me know if you change your mind and stay in california.
即使沒有 你也是最好的爸爸
If not, you're a really great dad.
