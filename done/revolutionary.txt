- 那你是做什麼的？
- 我正在學習表演，你呢？
- So, what do you do?
- I'm studying to be an actress. You?
- 我在碼頭做搬運工
- 認真說啦
- I'm a longshoreman.
- No, I mean, really.
我是認真說的
I mean really, too.
不過下週一開始
Although, starting next Monday,
我會換一份更體面的工作
I'm doing something
a little more glamorous.
是什麼？
What's that?
自助餐廳的夜間收銀員
Night cashier at a cafeteria.
我不是問你靠什麼餬口
你真正感興趣的是什麼？
I don't mean how you make money.
I mean, what are you interested in?
親愛的，要是我回答了這個問題
Honey, if I had the answer to that one,
你我一定都會無聊透頂
I bet I'd bore us both to death
in half an hour.
謝天謝地總算是完了
Thank God that's over.
這就是月桂劇團的處女秀
So much for the debut
of the Laurel Players.
她看起來很失望
And she was very disappointing.
- 弗蘭克！很精彩呀，弗蘭克！
- 多謝，吉文斯太太
- Frank! Very nice, Frank!
- Thanks so much, Mrs Givings.
我們真是陶醉其中了
你太太真是太有天分了
I can't tell you how much we enjoyed it.
You have a very talented wife.
我會轉告她的
I'll pass it along.
- 弗蘭克！
- 你好！
- Frank!
- Hi!
她在裡面，我已經準備好喝酒了
She's in there.
I'm about ready for that drink.
等幾分鐘
Couple of minutes.
艾波爾？親愛的？
April? Sweetheart?
- Hi.
- Hi.
- 準備走了嗎？
- 嗯
- You about ready to leave?
- Yeah. Yeah.
等我先卸妝
I've just got to get this makeup off.
看樣子不是很成功啊，是麼？
Well, I guess it wasn't a triumph
or anything, was it?
- 不算是，我一會兒就好
- 不急
- I guess not. I'll be ready in a minute.
- Take your time.
對了，幫我個忙好嗎？
Listen, will you do me a favour?
米莉和薛普想和我們一起去慶祝
Milly and Shep wanted us
to go out with them after.
你能不能拒絕他們？
就說是保姆之類的事情
Will you say we can't? Say it's because
of the babysitter or something.
可是我已經答應他們了
Well, the thing is,
I already said that we could.
剛才看到他們了，我就答應了
I mean, I just saw them
and I said that we would.
那你能不能出去告訴他們你搞錯了？
Then would you mind going out again
and saying you were mistaken?
這應該不難吧
That should be simple enough.
你不覺得這有點粗魯嗎，艾波爾？
Don't you think
that's a little bit rude, April?
- 那我自己去說
- 好好，別激動
- Then I'll tell them myself.
- Okay. Okay. Take it easy.
好嗎？我去說
All right? I'll tell them.
說真的，寶貝，其他人和你比都黯然失色
I mean it, baby.
You were the only person in that play.
謝謝
Thank you.
就不該讓你去和那幫人同台
We shouldn't have let you get
mixed up in the damned thing, is all.
行吧
All right.
一群三腳貓，你可是專業的啊，天
What a bunch of amateurs. I mean,
you've studied, for Christ's sake.
能不能不說這個了？
Could we stop talking about it now?
行
Sure.
我只是不想讓你難過
I just don't want you
feeling bad about it, that's all.
你知道，這不值得
Because it's not worth it, you know.
跟這些人混在一起真是糟…
It's bad enough having to live out
here amongst these people...
- 你剛說什麼？
- 我說對，弗蘭克
- What'd you say?
- I said yes. All right, Frank.
你能不能在我抓狂之前閉嘴？
Could you just stop talking about it now
before you drive me crazy, please?
你幹嘛？
What are you doing?
艾波爾，親愛的，好好說話行不？
April, sweetheart,
let's talk about this, okay?
- 別，弗蘭克，別這樣
- 過來
- No, Frank, please don't do that.
- Come on, now.
- 別碰我
- 艾波爾…
- Don't touch me.
- April...
別理我
Just leave me alone.
好，好
Okay. Okay.
我感覺現在的氣氛很不對勁
It strikes me that there's a considerable
amount of bullshit going on here.
我想澄清幾點，好嗎？
And there's just a few things
that I'd like to clear up. All right?
第一，戲演的那麼差不是我的錯，對吧？
Number one, it's not my fault
that the play was lousy. Okay?
第二，你沒能成為真正的演員
Number two,
it sure as hell isn't my fault
也他媽的跟我沒關係
that you didn't turn out to be an actress,
你越早離開這些肥皂戲劇
and the sooner you get over
that little piece of soap opera,
我們才能過得越好
the better off we're both going to be.
第三，我可不是那種愚蠢的
Number three,
I don't happen to fit the role
後知後覺的鄉村老公
of dumb, insensitive suburban husband.
自從我們搬來之後
你就一直把錯推到我頭上
You've been trying to lay that crap
on me ever since we moved out here.
我他媽的沒那麼笨
And I'm damned if I'll wear it.
第四…艾波爾？艾波爾！
Number four... April? April!
艾波爾
April.
你他媽的幹嗎？給我回車裡去
What the hell are you doing?
Get back in the car.
不，等一下，讓我站一會兒
No. I will in a minute.
Just let me stand here for a second.
他媽的！
God damn it!
艾波爾，能不能別大晚上站在12號公路上
April, can you please just get back
in the car and talk about this
我們回車裡談好嗎？
instead of running all over Route 12?
我是不是沒說清楚？
我不想談這件事
Haven't I made it clear I don't
particularly want to talk about it?
好，看在上帝的份上
Okay. I mean, Jesus,
I'm trying to be nice
我只是想跟你好好說話
about this thing here, for God's sake.
你真好啊，你對我還真好啊
How kind of you.
How terribly, terribly kind of you.
等等，你不該這麼對我
Wait a minute. I don't deserve this.
你總是很確定
You're always so wonderfully definite
自己該得到什麼，不該得到什麼
on the subject of what you do
and don't deserve.
等等！等…艾波爾！你給我聽著
Wait a minute! Wait a goddamn... April!
Now you listen to me.
這次你再也不能
This is one time
you're not going to get away
隨意歪曲我的本意了，艾波爾
with twisting everything that I say, April.
碰巧這次我很清楚
This just happens to be
one goddamn time
我絕沒有做錯什麼事
I know I'm not in the wrong here.
天，真希望你今晚沒來
Christ, I wish
you'd stayed home tonight.
你知道自己現在什麼樣子嗎，艾波爾？
You know what you are
when you're like this, April?
你病了，說真的
You're sick. I really mean that.
- 你病了！
- 你知道你什麼樣子嗎？
- You're sick! What?
- And do you know what you are?
- 你真噁心
- 哦，是嗎？
- You're disgusting.
- Oh, yeah?
別玩我了，弗蘭克
You don't fool me, Frank.
別以為你讓我呆在一個安全的陷阱裡
Just because you've got me safely
in this little trap,
你就可以為所欲為地控制我的感情
you think you can bully me into feeling
whatever you want me to feel!
- 你在陷阱裡？你在陷阱裡？
- 對！對！我是說我，弗蘭克！
- You in a trap? You in a trap?
- Yes! Yes! Me, Frank!
- 老天爺，別逼我笑！
- 就是這樣！
- Jesus Christ, don't make me laugh!
- Me!
你這個自欺欺人的可憐蟲，看看你自己！
You pathetic, self-deluded little boy.
Look at you!
看看自己，再告訴我
Look at you and tell me, how by any
stretch of the imagination
就你這樣也敢自詡為男人？
you can call yourself a man?
操！
Damn it!
老天爺！
Jesus Christ!
- 別這麼看著我，艾波爾
- 現在能回家了嗎？
- Don't look at me like that, April.
- Could we please go home now?
片名：《革命之路》
十五樓到了
Fifteenth floor.
今早我你得幫我，哥們
I'm going to need your help
this morning, Old Scout.
一旦班迪靠近我，你就警告我
For the next few hours, you're to warn
me of Bandy's every approach
還有，萬一我肚子太餓了
and you may need to shield me
from public view
你得幫我多擋著
in the likely event I void my stomach.
真的很緊急
It's that bad.
早上好，傑克
Good morning, Jack.
沒什麼好事的，我保證
Nothing good about it, I assure you.
當然，你一下火車，我就知道
Of course, I knew the moment
you stepped off the train
你在找什麼樣的房子
what you were looking for.
翻修的小穀倉，或者馬車房
A small remodelled barn,
or a carriage house.
我可不願意唱黑臉
And I just hate to be
the one to tell you that sort of thing
告訴你這種房子已經沒有了
just isn't available any more.
不過不要失望
But I don't want you to despair.
我要帶你去看一處房子
There is one place up here
I want to show you.
當然了，這條路上沒什麼好房子
Now, of course, it isn't very desirable
at this end.
你們也看到了
克勞福德路上儘是這種煤渣房
As you can see, Crawford Road
is mostly these little cinder-blocky,
住著一些水管工，木匠，貨車司機
pick-up trucky places,
plumbers, carpenters,
類似這種的本地人
little local people of that sort.
不過往前走呢…
But eventually...
就到了革命路，這裡就好多了
Eventually it leads up to Revolutionary
Road, which is much nicer.
我要帶你們看的房子呢
Now, the place I want to show you
環境優美，小巧別緻
is a sweet little house
and a sweet little setting.
簡單整潔，很好的草坪
對小孩子再好不過了
Simple, clean lines, good lawns,
marvellous for children.
拐個彎就到了
It's just around this next curve.
就在那裡
看到那個小白房了嗎？很不錯吧？
Now, you'll see it. There.
See the little white one? Sweet, isn't it?
很精神地坐落在小坡上，迷人吧？
The perky way it sits there on
its little slope? Charming, isn't it?
是啊
Oh, yes.
你找我？
You wanted to see me?
今早托萊多（港口城市）發來找你的
這是這個月第三次了
Came for you from Toledo this morning.
This is the third one this month.
抱歉，我以為已經弄好了…
Sorry. I thought I'd taken care of...
我不想再和你說這種事了，弗蘭克
I'm not prepared to have this
conversation again, Frank.
- 明白嗎？
- 我只不過是…
- You understand?
- I was literally just getting into...
那裡的人很尊重我們
所以我們做事必須有效率
These folks in the provinces look up
to us. We need to be efficient.
不能老這麼反反覆覆
We can't have this
kind of back and forth, and so forth.
- 這樣很沒效率，是吧？
- 嗯
- It's just not efficient. Am I right?
- Yes.
- 什麼事？
- 托萊多
- What was that about?
- Toledo.
主管經理要求修改
Branch manager wants
a revised brochure
關於諾克斯500的會議的宣傳冊子
for the conference on the Knox 500.
「這樣很沒效率？是吧？是吧？是吧？」
"It's just not efficient. Am I right?
Am I right? Am I right?"
跟老太婆似的
Sounds like a goodie.
天，我都不知道諾克斯500是幹嘛的
你知道不？
For God's sake. I don't even know what
the Knox 500 does. Do you?
別抬舉我了
Don't insult me.
在SP 1109下面的待用文檔裡
If you'll look in the inactive file
under SP 1109,
能找到我們發往代理商的所有文件副本
you'll find copies of all the stuff we sent
to the agency,
這樣就能夠往回追溯到發件人了
that way we can trace the thing back
to its original sources.
聽著，你沒打算這麼早吃午飯吧
Listen, I hope you weren't planning
on having an early lunch.
沒，我不是很餓
No. I'm not really hungry.
好，我回頭再來找你，好吧？
Good. I'll check on you later then.
All right?
- 行
- 好
- Okay.
- Okay.
知道嗎莫林，遇到我你算是走運了
You know something, Maureen?
You're lucky you met me.
怎麼說？
How's that?
我可以告訴你竅門
I think I can show you the ropes,
you know.
想在諾克斯公司生存，要掌握一定的技巧
我演示給你看
There's a certain art to survival at Knox.
Really. Let me show you what I mean.
服務員，給我拿電話過來好嗎？
再來兩瓶馬蒂尼
Waiter. Bring me the telephone,
would you? And two more martinis.
哇
Wow.
請接克朗代克55566
Klondike 5-55-66, please.
您好，約根森太太？我是弗蘭克·惠勒
Hello, Mrs Jorgensen?
Frank Wheeler here. Yes.
我就是想告訴您一聲
我把莫林·格魯德要了過來
I just wanted to let you know
that I've had to send Maureen Grube
做我的視覺助理
down to Visual Aids for me.
可能整個下午都需要她，對
I'll probably need her
the rest of the afternoon. Yes.
您也一樣，午安
You, too. Take care now.
- 我從沒聽說過什麼視覺助理
- 因為根本就不存在這個職位
- I never even heard of Visual Aids.
- That's because it doesn't exist.
你好，海倫，快請進
Hi, Helen. Come on in.
我就是路過
I can't stay a minute.
我給你帶了一些景天植物
I just wanted to bring
these sedum plantings
來點綴車道盡頭的那片地
for that messy patch
down by the foot of the drive.
它跟歐洲石蓮花差不多
It's like the European houseleek,
不過會開很好看的小黃花
only these have the most marvellous
little yellow blossoms.
只需要在開頭幾天
Now, all it wants for the first few days
澆一點水，之後就能茁壯成長了
is just a tiny dollop of water,
and then you'll find it absolutely thrives.
那謝謝你了，海倫，你人真好
Well, thank you, Helen.
That's so kind of you.
要不要咖啡？
Would you like some coffee?
有什麼需要我做的嗎，海倫？
Is there something
I can do for you, Helen?
我差點忘了
I almost forgot.
有一個不情之請
There is one small favour
I would like to ask.
是我的…是我的兒子，約翰
他進醫院了
It's about... It's about my son, John.
He's been in the hospital.
很遺憾，都還好吧？
I'm sorry. Is everything all right?
嗯，他現在暫時呆在
布萊森·布魯克，精神病院
Well, actually, just for the time being,
he's in Pleasant Brook. Psychiatric.
- 哦，我知道了
- 其實沒什麼大不了的
- Oh, I see.
- Well, it's nothing serious.
小毛病，用不了多久就會好的
He just got a little run down. Things can
just get the better of us sometimes.
- 你說是吧？
- 嗯，當然
- Don't you agree?
- Yes. Of course.
那裡條件很好
It's a marvellous facility
治療看起來也很有效
and the treatments
seem to be doing wonders for him.
話說回來，醫生說讓他出來一下午
Anyway, they said getting him out
for an afternoon
也許對他會有好處
might do him a little bit of good.
坦白說，他覺得我的朋友們太保守了
I think he finds my friends
a little conventional, quite frankly.
他是見過世面的人，有數學博士學位
I mean, he's travelled.
He has a Ph.D. In mathematics.
說他是個天才也不為過
I suppose you could say
he's an intellectual.
如果能讓他來見見你們夫婦
那真是再好不過了
It would do him a world of good
to meet a young couple like you.
當然，我們很願意見他
Well, we'd love to meet him.
- 真的？
- 是的
- Really?
- Yes.
很願意
We'd love to.
謝謝你，親愛的
Thank you, dear.
謝謝
Thank you.
好了，我得走了
Well, I must be off.
我記得你們剛下火車的那天
I remember the first day
you came off the train.
你們跟我其他的客戶不一樣，很特別
You weren't like my other clients.
You were different.
一看就不是普通人
You just seemed special.
當然了，現在還是
Of course, you still are.
記住，只要澆一點水，我走了先
Remember, just a dollop. I must scoot.
Toodle-oo.
再見
Bye.
我覺得有點醉了
I think you got me a little drunk.
知道今天是什麼日子？
You know what today is?
星期一？
Monday?
今天是我的生日，我三十歲了
It's my birthday. I'm 30 years old today.
- 生日快樂！
- 謝謝
- Happy birthday!
- Thank you.
你編的那個職位叫什麼來著？
What was the name of that department
you made up again?
視覺助理
Visual Aids.
真搞笑
What a joke.
真搞笑
What a joke. Oh, my.
- 你想聽真正的笑話嗎？
- 嗯
- You want to hear a real joke?
- Yes.
- 我父親也曾在諾克斯工作
- 是嗎？
- My old man worked at Knox.
- Yeah?
他在洋克斯市做銷售員
He was a salesman in Yonkers.
每年他都會帶我去城裡吃一次飯
Once a year he used to take me
into the city for lunch.
這個場合很特別，他會傳授點人生經歷之類的東西
It was supposed to be a very special,
life-advice sort of occasion.
- 不錯啊
- 不，其實不然
- Nice.
- No. Not really.
每當那時侯，我總會想
I used to sit there and think,
「老天，我長大了可別像你這樣」
"I hope to Christ I don't end up like you."
現在看看我，三十歲的諾克斯員工
Now, here I am,
a 30-year-old Knox man.
造化弄人啊
Can you beat that?
我好像有點記不清楚了…
I think I kind of lost you...
你父親也在諾克斯工作？
Your father worked for Knox?
很抱歉，我有點集中不了精力了
I'm sorry, everything's just kind of
going out of focus.
不如我們出去透透氣？
Why don't we get some air,
you and me?
這是你嗎？
Is this you?
對
Yeah.
- 你去過巴黎嗎？
- 我哪兒也沒去過
- You been to Paris?
- I've never really been anywhere.
也許我可以帶你去
Maybe I'll take you with me then.
告訴你，一有機會我就會回巴黎去
I'm going back the first chance I get,
I tell you.
那裡的人充滿活力，不像這裡
People are alive there. Not like here.
我需要那種感受，艾波爾
All I know, April, is I want to feel things.
那種真切的感受
Really feel them, you know.
我很有野心吧？
How's that for an ambition?
弗蘭克·惠勒？我覺得你是我見過的
最有意思的人
Frank Wheeler? I think you're the most
interesting person I've ever met.
今早上班的時候沒想到會發生這種事吧？
I guess this wasn't what you had in mind
when you went to work this morning?
沒，當然沒想到
No. It certainly wasn't.
你有煙嗎，弗蘭克？
Do you have a cigarette, Frank?
當然有
Yeah, sure.
給你
There you go.
要不要喝點什麼？
Can I get you a drink or anything?
不用了，謝謝，莫林
說實在的，現在…
No thanks, Maureen. Actually, it's...
已經有點晚了，我得回去了
It's getting kind of late.
I guess I'd better be cutting out.
哦對啊，你是不是錯過火車了？
Gee, that's right.
Did you miss your train?
沒事的，我可以趕下一班
That's all right, I'll catch the next one.
你看起來真美
Listen, you were swell.
保重
Take care now.
- 弗蘭克
- 你穿這麼整齊幹嗎？
- Frank.
- Why are you all dressed up?
首先，我今天很想你
我想跟你道歉
First of all, I missed you all day
and I want to say I'm sorry.
我為演出之後的所作所為道歉
I'm sorry for the way I've been
since the play.
為所有那些事道歉，我愛你
I'm sorry for everything, and I love you.
其他先不說了
The rest can wait.
等我叫你再進來好嗎？
Now, you just wait here
till I call you. Okay?
好
Okay.
好了弗蘭克，進來吧
All right, Frank. You can come in now.
祝你生日快樂
Happy birthday to you
祝你生日快樂
Happy birthday to you
祝親愛的老爸生日快樂
Happy birthday, dear Daddy
祝你生日快樂
Happy birthday to you
祝你生日快樂，親愛的
Happy birthday, darling.
- 我愛你，爸爸
- 我也愛你
- I love you, Daddy.
- I love you, too.
弗蘭克
Frank.
弗蘭克，我有個好主意
Frank. I have had
the most wonderful idea.
- 我今天一直在想
- 什麼主意，寶貝？
- I've been thinking about it all day.
- Baby, what's all this about?
你知道我們存了多少錢了嗎？
Do you know how much money
we have saved?
不用你上班，也夠用六個月
Enough to live on for six months
without you earning another dime.
如果賣了車和房子，還能過更久
And with the money we could get from
the house and the car, longer than that.
「賣了房子」？
"What we could get for the house"?
親愛的，你說什麼呢？那我們住哪裡？
Sweetheart, what are you talking about?
Where are we going to live?
巴黎
Paris.
什麼？
What?
你一直說，那是惟一一個
You always said it was the only place
you'd ever been
你願意再去的地方
唯一值得過日子的地方
that you wanted to go back to,
the only place that was worth living.
那我們為什麼不去呢？
So why don't we go there?
- 你說真的？
- 是啊，有什麼困難嗎？
- You're serious?
- Yes. What's stopping us?
有什麼困難？我可以說出一堆來
What's stopping us? Well, I can think
of a number of different things.
比如，去那裡我能做什麼？
For example, what kind of a job
could I possibly get?
不用你上班，因為我會有工作
You won't be getting any
kind of a job, because I will.
哦，是啊，是啊
Oh, right, right.
別笑我，聽我說
Don't laugh at me. Listen a minute.
你知道政府給那些
Do you know what they pay
for secretarial positions
- 駐歐洲的秘書職位什麼薪水嗎？
- 不知道
- in government agencies in Europe?
- No, I don't.
聽著弗蘭克，我是認真說的
你以為我在開玩笑嗎？
Listen, Frank, I'm serious about this.
Do you think I'm kidding or something?
行，我只是有一些問題
Okay, okay.
I just have a couple of questions, is all.
首先，要是你負責賺錢
For one thing, what exactly
am I supposed to be doing
那我該幹什麼？
while you're out earning all this money?
你不明白嗎？關鍵就在於此
Don't you see? That's the whole idea.
你干你七年前想幹卻沒能幹成的事
You'll be doing what you should've
been allowed to do seven years ago.
你會有很多時間
You'll have time.
這會是你這輩子第一次有時間
For the first time in your life
you'll have time to find out
思考自己該幹什麼
what it is that you actually want to do.
當你想好以後
And when you figure it out,
你還會有足夠的時間和自由去實現抱負
you'll have the time and the freedom
to start doing it.
親愛的，這太不切實際了
Sweetheart, it's just
not very realistic, is all.
不，弗蘭克，我告訴你什麼才叫不切實際
No, Frank. This is what's unrealistic.
讓一個有理想的男人
It's unrealistic for a man
with a fine mind to go on working
日復一日幹著他不想幹的工作
year after year at a job he can't stand,
回到一個他不願意呆的地方
coming home to a place he can't stand,
面對一個同樣不能忍受這一切的老婆
這才是不切實際的
to a wife who's equally unable to stand
the same things.
你知道最糟糕的是什麼嗎？
Do you want to know the worst part?
我們自以為比周圍的人和事
Our whole existence here
is based on this great premise
都來得特別，來得高貴
that we're special and superior
to the whole thing.
其實不是的
But we're not.
我們跟普通人一樣
We're just like everyone else.
你看看我們，理所當然的認為
Look at us. We've bought into
the same ridiculous delusion.
有了孩子之後
This idea that
you have to resign from life
就應該結束自己的生活，安頓下來
and settle down the moment
you have children.
我們一直因為這種荒唐的做法相互懲罰
And we've been
punishing each other for it.
聽著，是我們倆自己決定搬到這裡
Listen, we decided to move out here.
沒人強迫我去諾克斯工作
No one forced me
to take the job at Knox.
再說了，誰說我有更重要的事去做？
I mean, whoever said I was meant
to be a big deal, anyway?
第一次見到你時
你是個有著雄心壯志的人
When I first met you, there was nothing
in the world you couldn't do or be.
第一次見到我時，我只是個耍小聰明的人
When you first met me
I was a little wise guy
滿嘴忽悠，僅此而已
with a big mouth, that's all.
不是，你怎麼能這麼說自己？
You were not.
How can you even say that?
好，我會有很多時間
Okay. Okay, so I'll have time.
誰都知道這很誘惑人，很誘惑
And God knows that's appealing.
It's very appealing.
如果我有天分
如果我是個作家或者藝術家
And everything you're saying
makes sense
你設想的一切就說得通
if I had a definite talent,
if I were a writer or an artist.
不，弗蘭克，你聽我說
No. But, Frank, listen. Listen to me.
真實的你被壓抑住了
It's what you are that's being stifled.
真實的你在這樣的生活中
被一次又一次否定
It's what you are that's being denied
and denied in this kind of life.
那我該是怎樣的？
And what's that?
你不知道嗎？
Don't you know?
你是這世間最美最好的人
You're the most beautiful
and wonderful thing in the world.
你是個真男人
You're a man.
這是我們的機會，弗蘭克，我們的機會
This is our chance, Frank.
This is our one chance.
好
Okay.
好？
Okay?
為何不呢？何樂而不為呢？
Why not? Why the hell not?
- 早上好，各位
- 早安，弗蘭克
- Good morning, all.
- Morning, Frank.
弗蘭克，很高興看到你燦爛的笑容
Franklin. Good to see your shining face.
- 有什麼好消息？
- 夥計們，我要搬去巴黎了
- What's the news?
- Fellas, I'm moving to Paris.
是嗎，那我要搬去丹吉爾了
（摩洛哥城市）
Indeed. And I'm moving to Tangiers.
發往托萊多的內部信件
Intra-company letter to Toledo.
主管經理B·F·查默斯收
Attention B.F. Chalmers,
Branch Manager.
鑒於近期頻繁反覆的通信
With regard to recent and repeated
correspondence,
本人在此通告，該事項已經得到
this is to advise
that the matter has been
完美的解決，句號
very satisfactorily taken in hand, period.
另起一段，我們完全同意
現有的宣傳手冊內容很不合適
Paragraph. We wholly agree that
the existing brochure is unsuitable.
為此，我們開發了
To this end, we have developed, quote,
「關於生產控制的論述」
"Speaking of Production Control."
惠勒太太，這是您要的旅行支票
Here you go, Mrs Wheeler. These are
the traveller's cheques you requested.
- 嗯
- 這是您預訂的汽船票
- Yes.
- Your steamer reservations.
這些我會代為轉交大使館
These I'll pass on
to the embassy for you.
- 祝您好運
- 謝謝
- Good luck.
- Thank you.
九月，最晚十月
September. October at the outside.
我只是覺得，我們該幹一些
I just happen to think
people are better off
自己真正喜歡做的事情
doing some kind of work
they actually like.
- 對，沒錯
- 的確
- Right. Right, yes.
- Absolutely, absolutely.
但如果，假設說
這裡有一個好的職位給你
But, I mean, assuming there is
this true vocation waiting for you,
你難道也會拒絕？
wouldn't you be just as likely
to discover it here as there?
我不覺得諾克斯大廈十五層
I don't think it's possible
to discover anything
可能發生什麼奇跡
on the 15th floor of the Knox building,
在座各位應該也不會有這種想法吧
and I don't think any of you do either.
爸爸，爸爸，爸爸！
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!
- 邁克
- 爸爸，能不能給我讀…
- Michael.
- Daddy, will you read us...
…一直到這裡
...all the way to here.
我們要坐一艘大船才能到那裡
We have to take a big boat ride
across the sea to get there.
- 但那裡的人我都不認識
- 我知道，我也不認識
- But I won't know anybody there.
- I know. I know. Neither will I.
但你記得剛上學時的感覺嗎？
But remember how you felt
when you started school?
再看看現在，有多少朋友了
And now look
how many friends you have.
你怎麼也猜不到巴黎人吃什麼
You'll never guess
what they eat in Paris.
- 不可能猜到
- 是什麼？
- You'll never guess.
- What?
- 黏蝸牛
- 蝸牛？
- Slimy snails.
- Snails?
黏蝸牛，還有黏青蛙的腿
Slimy snails and icky frog's legs.
米莉，你在哪兒寶貝？
Milly, where are you, doll?
你最好去換衣服，他們馬上要來了
You better get changed,
they'll be here soon.
- 你就穿這個？
- 你不喜歡？
- Is that what you're wearing?
- Don't you like it?
嗯，很好看，寶貝
Yeah, yeah. You look great, doll.
看來我得趕緊了
Guess I better haul ass.
小子們
Hiya, gang.
在看什麼？
What you watching?
薛普？
Shep?
我一直在叫你
I was calling you and calling you.
你好
Hi.
來了，一點小意思
Here we go. Just a little something.
- 看起來不錯啊，我肚子開始叫了
- 艾波爾，我一直忘不掉
- Those look great. I'm starving.
- April, I can't get over it,
你看起來很滿足
you look like the cat that ate the canary.
你們是不是有事要告訴我們？
一些新聞什麼的？
Do you have something to tell us?
Just a little bit of news?
這個，米莉，我們…的確有很重要的消息
Well, actually, Milly, we... Well, we do
have some important news, yes.
我就知道
I knew it.
親愛的，你來說吧
Honey, why don't you tell them?
Go ahead.
我們要去歐洲了，去巴黎
We're going to Europe. To Paris.
搬過去
To live.
- 什麼？
- 什麼時候？
- What?
- When?
- 九月份
- 為什麼呢？
- In September.
- But what for?
為什麼？因為這是我們一直來的夢想
What for?
Well, because we've always wanted to.
因為孩子們還小，因為那裡太美了
Because the kids are young enough.
Because it's beautiful.
薛普，你去過那裡，你說說看
I mean, really.
Shep, you've been there, you tell her.
- 對，是個很棒的城市
- 是啊
- Yeah, it's a great city.
- Yeah.
你們什麼時候決定的？
When did you make this decision?
大概一周前？記不清楚了
About a week ago?
It's hard to remember.
我們是突然決定的
We just suddenly decided to go,
that's all.
- 一周前決定，現在才跟我們說
- 我們也要一點時間來適應
- About a week ago, you tell us now.
- We had to get used to the idea.
怎麼回事弗蘭克？
你在那邊找了新工作還是怎麼的？
So, what's the deal, Frank?
You get a job over there, or what?
- 不，不完全是這樣
- 什麼叫「不完全是這樣」？
- No, no. Not exactly.
- What do you mean, "Not exactly"?
弗蘭克不需要工作，我去上班
Frank won't be getting
any kind of a job, because I will.
那你做什麼，弗蘭克？
So what are you going to do, Frank?
我要學習，讀書
I'm going to study.
And I'm going to read.
我想我會弄清楚
我這輩子到底要做什麼，薛普
I suppose I'm going to finally figure out
what I want to do with my life, Shep.
你思考的時候她來養你？
While she supports you?
對，她來養我
Yes. While she supports me.
當然只是一開始
In the beginning.
你們猜不到政府給駐歐洲的秘書職位
You wouldn't believe what they pay
for secretarial work
什麼樣的薪水
in those government agencies
over there.
北約啦，非洲經濟委員會之類的地方
NATO and ECA and those places.
而且那裡生活成本真是低，對吧？
And the cost of living
is dirt cheap, right?
太低了
It's so cheap.
說真的，我們只是希望有所改變
The truth is we just need
something different.
我們已經不再年輕，不想再浪費生命了
We're not getting any younger and
we don't want life to just pass us by.
沒錯
That's right.
天，聽起來太美好了
Gee, it sounds wonderful, kids.
真的，太美好了
I mean it. It really sounds wonderful.
- 謝謝，米莉
- 噢，米莉
- Thank you, Milly.
- Oh, Milly.
我們一定會想你們的，是吧？
We'll certainly miss you both.
Won't we, sweetie? Golly.
- 當然
- 我們也會想你們的
- Sure.
- We'll miss you, too.
- 當然
- 嗯
- Of course.
- True.
我們是不是該碰一下，為了巴黎
We should have a toast or something.
To Paris.
- 為了巴黎
- 為了巴黎
- To Paris.
- To Paris.
為了巴黎
To Paris.
- 乾杯
- 乾杯
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
知道我怎麼想的嗎？
You know what I think?
什麼？
What?
整個計劃有點不夠成熟
I think this whole plan
sounds a little immature.
哦天，我真是鬆了一口氣
Oh, God, I am so relieved.
我也是，我剛才也一直在想
Me, too.
I was thinking that the whole time.
什麼樣的男人願意整天穿著浴袍
I mean, what kind of man
is going to sit around
讓老婆在外工作
in his bathrobe all day picking his nose
- 而自己坐在那兒摳鼻子？
- 對啊，薛普
- while his wife goes out and works?
- I don't know, Shep.
我真是不明白
I just don't know.
你哭什麼？
Why are you crying?
怎麼了？
What's the matter?
沒什麼，就是放心了
It's nothing. I'm just so relieved.
薛普
Shep.
別哭，沒事的，都會好起來的
Don't cry. Please. It's all right.
Everything's going to be all right.
天，看看他們的表情！哦天
My God, their faces! Oh, God.
哦，天！
Oh, God!
你知道這是什麼樣的感覺嗎，艾波爾？
You know what this is like,
April, honestly?
說出這樣的話？
Just talking like this?
這搬到歐洲去的想法？
The whole idea of going off
to Europe this way?
我感覺就像第一場上戰場
This is the way I felt going up to the line
the first time, in the war.
也許我和別人一樣害怕
I mean, I was probably
just as scared as everyone else,
但內心深處，卻從沒感覺這麼美好
but inside I never felt better.
我覺得充滿活力，熱血澎湃…
I felt alive. I felt full of blood. I felt...
這一切…一切看起來更真實了
Everything just...
Everything seemed more real.
那些穿著制服的傢伙
The guys in their uniforms.
田野裡的雪，還有樹上的雪
我們就這麼走著
The snow on the fields, the trees.
And all of us just walking.
當然了我心裡害怕
I mean, I was scared, of course.
但我一直在想
「沒錯，就是這樣，這才是生活」
But I just kept thinking,
"This is it, you know. This is the truth."
我曾經有過這樣的感覺
I felt that way once, too.
什麼時候？
When?
第一次和你做愛的時候
The first time you made love to me.
艾波爾
April.
弗蘭克
Frank.
- 怎麼了？
- 巴特·波洛克來了
- What's up?
- Bart Pollock's here.
在班迪的辦公室呢
He's in Bandy's office.
有大事了，對吧？
Big deal, huh?
看樣子他們要找你談話
Looks like he wants to talk to you.
嗨，別把我扯進去
Hey, keep my name out of it.
弗蘭克，很高興見到你
認識巴特·波洛克嗎？
Frank. Good to see you.
You know Bart Pollock?
- 我們沒見過，不過當然…
- 很高興認識你，弗蘭克
- Well, we've never met, but of course...
- Good to know you, Frank.
「關於生產控制的論述」？
"Speaking of Production Control"?
弗蘭克，這真是神來之筆
Frank, this is a crackerjack.
托萊多那幫人非常滿意
They are tickled to death in Toledo.
真的？
Really?
（《法國旅遊指南》）
沒有比這個波洛克更爛的老總了
So, this guy Pollock was perfect
presidential material in the worst sense.
肥頭大腦，千金難博一笑
A million dollar smile and about three
pounds of muscle between the ears.
艾波爾，你真該聽聽他說的話
April, you should have heard this guy.
「弗蘭克，這真是神來之筆」
真會拍馬屁
"Frank, this is a crackerjack."
What a horse's ass.
不知道你說打算辭職的時候
他臉上是什麼表情
Wish I'd seen his face
when you told him you were leaving.
是啊
Yeah.
他們來了
Here they come.
- 抱歉來晚了
- 沒晚
- Sorry to be late.
- You're not late.
- 街上太堵了
- 謝謝，真是太客氣了
- The traffic was terrible.
- Thank you. You didn't have to do that.
- 很高興見到你
- 太可怕了是吧，霍華德
- Good to see you.
- Wasn't it terrible, Howard?
可不是，12號公路
Well, Route 12.
估計等到路拓寬了之後
By the time they finish
that stretch of road,
照樣還是那麼堵
they'll have to start all over again, right?
- 你一定是約翰了？
- 打招呼，約翰
- And you must be John?
- Say hello, John.
很高興見到你們，久仰了
Nice to meet you. Heard a lot about you.
- 你們可愛的孩子們呢？
- 去參加生日聚會了
- Where are your darling children?
- They're at a birthday party.
- 很抱歉他們不在
- 沒關係
- Sorry they couldn't be here.
- Don't worry.
如果知道有瘋子要來造訪
If I had a certified lunatic
coming around my house,
我也會把孩子們送走
I'd probably get the kids
out of the way, too.
看看這些吃的，沒必要這麼麻煩
Look at all this food. You didn't
have to go to any trouble for us.
就是一些三明治
It's just some sandwiches.
約翰，你愛吃三明治嗎？
John, would you like a sandwich?
幾個月來海倫一直在說你們
Helen's been talking it up
about you people for months.
革命路上那對美滿的惠勒夫婦
The nice young Wheelers
on Revolutionary Road,
革命路上那對美滿的惠勒夫婦
the nice young Revolutionaries
on Wheeler Road.
- 有人想喝雪莉酒嗎？
- 不用麻煩了，弗蘭克
- Would anyone like some sherry?
- Please don't bother, Frank.
我想要一些
I'd like some sherry.
海倫的那份也給我，如果她不搶走的話
And I'll drink Helen's, too,
if she doesn't beat me to it.
你們有那種高玻璃杯嗎？
But, hey, you got a high-ball glass?
放一些冰塊進去，然後再滿上
Put a couple-three ice cubes in it,
pour it up to the brim.
- 我喜歡那樣
- 我應該能搞定
- That's the way I like it.
- I think I can handle that.
雞蛋沙拉真是太美味了，艾波爾
你一定得告訴我怎麼做
This egg salad is delicious, April.
You must tell me how you fix it.
- 你是律師嗎，弗蘭克？
- 不，不是
- You a lawyer, Frank?
- No. No, I'm not.
我想聘個律師
I could use a lawyer.
約翰，別再說律師的事了
John, let's not get started again
about the lawyer.
爸，你就不能好好坐著
Pop, couldn't you just sit there
吃你的美味雞蛋沙拉，別廢話了？
and eat your wonderful egg salad
and quit horning in?
是這樣的，我有很多問題要問
See, I've got a good
many questions to ask
而且也願意為此付錢
and I'm willing to pay for the answers.
不必你說我也知道
一個男人帶著一張咖啡桌
Now, I don't need to be told that a man
who goes after his mother
被老媽領著上街，是多麼讓人瞧不起
這很明顯
with a coffee table is putting himself in
a weak position legally, that's obvious.
約翰，過來看看，外面風景多好
John, come and have a look
out this fabulous picture window.
但他如果用桌子砸死她，那就是犯罪了
If he hits her with it and kills her,
that's a criminal case.
- 看吶，太陽出來了
- 但他如果只是砸爛了桌子
- Oh, look, the sun's coming out!
- Lf all he does is break the coffee table
又對著她發洩了一定量的怒火
and give her
a certain amount of aggravation
而她又打算起訴他，這就是民事案件了
and she decides to
go to court over it, that's a civil case.
也許還能看見彩虹呢，過來看看約翰
Maybe we'll have a rainbow.
John, come have a look.
媽，幫個忙好不，你就不能閉嘴？
Ma, how about doing everybody
a favour? How about shutting up!
坐下來吧
Settle down, now.
也許我能幫你問問，找個人
你看如何？
Maybe I can look into it, recommend
someone. What do you say?
那麼你的工作是什麼，弗蘭克？
So, what do you do, Frank?
我在諾克斯商用機器公司上班
I work at Knox Business Machines,
actually.
你設計機器？
You design the machines?
- 不是
- 製造，銷售，還是維修？
- Nope.
- Make them, sell them, repair them?
- 這算什麼問題
- 我應該算幫著賣
- All these questions.
- I help sell them, I guess.
我在辦公室上班，實際上呢…
I work in the office. Actually, it's...
這個工作蠻傻的
Well, it's sort of a stupid job, really.
毫無樂趣可言
There's nothing interesting
about it at all.
那你為什麼要做呢？
What do you do it for then?
也許弗蘭克不喜歡被這麼糾纏著提問
Maybe Frank doesn't like
being questioned.
沒事，沒事，我知道這不關我事
Okay, okay, okay.
I know it's none of my business.
不過呢，我知道答案
And besides, I know the answer.
想要過家家，就得工作
You want to play house,
you got to have a job.
想要在很好的房子裡過家家
You want to play very nice house,
very sweet house,
你就得干你不喜歡的工作
then you've got to have
a job you don't like.
要是誰來問，「你為什麼要做這工作？」
Anyone comes along and says,
"What do you do it for?"
那他也許是出來放風四小時的
He's probably on a four-hour pass
from the state funny farm.
- 都同意吧，媽？
- 抱歉，弗蘭克
- All agreed? Ma?
- Sorry, Frank.
沒事，沒事，實際上呢約翰
你說的我完全同意
Don't be. Don't be. Actually, John,
I agree with everything you just said.
我們倆都同意，所以今年秋天
我要辭了這份工作，我們要走了
We both do. That's why I'm quitting
the job in the fall. We're taking off.
我們要搬到巴黎去
We're moving to Paris.
你知道這事嗎，媽？
Did you know about this, Ma?
你怎麼想的，媽？年輕美滿的惠勒夫婦…
How do you feel about that, Ma?
The nice young Wheelers...
年輕美滿的惠勒夫婦要搬走了
The nice young Wheelers are taking off.
- 拜託了，約翰
- 冷靜點，約翰
- John, please.
- Steady down, Son.
約翰，約翰，要不要呼吸點新鮮空氣？
John. John. How about some fresh air?
What do you say?
如果你不介意的話？
If that's all right with you?
- 我不知道這樣合不合適…
- 如果約翰願意，那沒問題
- I don't know if it's such a good idea...
- lf John wants to, I don't see the harm.
- 很好
- 你先請
- Good.
- After you.
- 我聽說你是個數學家
- 傳言有誤，都是過去的事了
- I hear you're a mathematician.
- You hear wrong. It's all gone now.
過去？
All gone?
你聽說過電擊療法嗎？
You know what
electrical shock treatments are?
嗯，聽說過
Yes. Yes, I do.
我做過37次
I've had 37.
想要除去情感問題
Supposed to jolt out
the emotional problems.
- 結果除去了數學知識
- 真可怕
- Just jolted out the mathematics.
- How awful.
「真可怕」？為什麼，數學很有意思嗎？
"How awful"? Why,
because mathematics is so interesting?
不，因為電擊太可怕了
No. Because the shocks
must be awful and,
而且你就做不成你喜歡做的事了
well, because it's awful not to be able
to do what it is that you want to do.
我就覺得數學很無聊
I think mathematics must be dull.
我喜歡你女人，弗蘭克
I like your girl, Frank.
我也是
Me, too.
那麼，像你們這樣一對夫婦
到底要逃避什麼？
So, what do a couple of people like you
have to run away from?
- 我們不是要逃避什麼
- 那巴黎有什麼？
- We're not running.
- So what's in Paris?
- 另一種生活方式
- 也許我們是在逃避
- A different way of life.
- Maybe we are running.
我們是在逃避這充滿
令人絕望的空虛的生活，對吧？
We're running from the hopeless
emptiness of the whole life here, right?
令人絕望的空虛？
The hopeless emptiness?
你還是說出來了
很多人都覺得空虛
Now you've said it. Plenty of people
are on to the emptiness,
但發現絕望，還是需要勇氣的
but it takes real guts
to see the hopelessness.
哇
Wow.
你知道麼，他好像是第一個
You know, he's the first person
真正理解我們想法的人
who seemed to know
what we were talking about.
的確，是吧？也許我們和他一樣癡狂
Yeah. That's true, isn't it?
Maybe we are just as crazy as he is.
如果癡狂的意思是過有意義的生活
If being crazy means
living life as if it matters,
那我不介意徹底瘋狂
then I don't care
if we are completely insane.
你呢？
Do you?
一樣
No.
我好愛你
I love you so much.
告訴你吧，弗蘭克
那個泰德·班迪人不錯
Tell you something, Frank.
That Ted Bandy, nice guy.
我很喜歡
Real sport.
作為部門領導，幹得很好
Good enough department head and all.
但這麼多年來他一直讓你幹那些活
But I'm a little sore at him
for the way he's kept you
我就不大滿意了
under a bushel all these years.
- 這家店可以嗎？
- 很好先生，很好了
- This place okay for you?
- It's just fine, sir. Just fine.
我只對一件事感興趣，弗蘭克，就一件事
One thing interests me, Frank,
and one thing only.
如何把電子計算機賣給美國商人
Selling the electronic computer
to the American businessman.
所以我在籌建一個小組，都是你這樣的人
That's why I'm assembling a team.
Men like you.
所以我在籌建一個小組，都是你這樣的人
That's why I'm assembling a team.
Men like you.
而不是普通的銷售人員
Not your average salesmen.
這意味著更豐厚的薪水
It'll mean more money,
不過老實說，也要花費更多的精力
and, I got to be honest,
maybe more of a time commitment.
但你會接觸到新鮮玩意，惠勒
But you'll be a part of
something exciting, Wheeler.
電腦
Computers.
聽起來很激動人心，先生
Well, sir, it sounds exciting.
- 叫我巴特
- 巴特
- Bart.
- Bart.
巴特，我想問你一個問題
Bart, let me ask you a question.
你記得一個叫厄爾·惠勒的人嗎？
在洋克斯市工作
Do you happen to remember
an Earl Wheeler? Out of Yonkers?
- 說實話不記得，你的親戚？
- 我父親
- Can't say that I do. Relation of yours?
- My father.
作為一名銷售員，他為諾克斯公司干了20年
He worked as a salesman for Knox
for almost 20 years.
厄爾·惠勒
Earl Wheeler.
厄爾·惠勒
Earl Wheeler.
當然你肯定不記得他
There's no reason you'd remember him.
這樣，我相信他是個好人
Well, I'm sure he was a good man.
聽著巴特，有件事我應該早就告訴你
Listen, Bart, there's something
I should have mentioned earlier.
我秋天就要從公司辭職了
I'm going to be leaving the firm
in the fall.
- 去別的公司？
- 不，不是跳槽
- Another outfit?
- No, no, it's not another outfit.
那告訴我，弗蘭克，是錢的原因嗎？
Now, look, Frank.
Is it a question of money?
如果是的話，我們可以坐下來
Because if it is, there's no reason
談個很好的價錢…
we can't get together on a satisfactory...
我很感謝，不過不是錢的原因
Well, I sure appreciate that,
but no, it's not the money.
這…更多算是個私人問題吧
It's... Well, it's more of a personal thing.
我希望你理解
I hope you understand.
私人問題？
A personal thing?
我知道了
I see.
弗蘭克，我跟你說一個我父親告訴我的道理
Frank, let me tell you something
my father told me.
人這一生，機會有限
A man only gets
a couple of chances in life.
如果遇到的時候不緊緊抓住
If he doesn't grab them by the balls,
那用不了多久，他就要開始自責
it won't be long before
he's sitting around wondering
為什麼自己不如別人
how he got to be second rate.
我想是的
I guess so.
所以拜託，好好想想
So, do me a favour. Sleep on it.
跟你老婆討論討論
Discuss it with your wife.
說老實話，沒有了老婆
Because let's be honest,
where the hell would any of us be
我們這些人又能從哪裡來？
without our wives, anyway?
還有弗蘭克，我很誠懇的告訴你
如果你打算加入我們的小組
And, Frank, in all sincerity,
if you do decide to join us,
我相信你永遠也不會後悔
I believe it'll be a thing
you'll never regret.
我還相信另外一點
And I believe something else, too.
這絕對是對你父親最好的紀念
I believe it'd be a fine memorial
to your dad.
好好想想，弗蘭克，用心想
Think about it, Frank.
Really think about it.
清楚你有什麼，逗號
Knowing what you've got, comma,
清楚你需要什麼，逗號
knowing what you need, comma,
清楚你離不開什麼，破折號
knowing what you can do without, dash.
這就是庫存管理
That's inventory control.
清楚你有什麼，逗號
Knowing what you've got, comma,
清楚你需要什麼，逗號
knowing what you need, comma,
清楚你離不開什麼，破折號
knowing what you can do without, dash.
這就是庫存管理
That's inventory control.
你好，弗蘭克
Hi, Frank.
又加班？
Working late?
對，我正在思考
Yeah. I got to dig myself out here.
聽說你要升職了
I heard you were getting promoted.
幹得好
Big shot.
我想你父親應該為你驕傲，嗯？
I guess your dad would have been
real proud, huh?
嗯，我想會的
Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.
那麼我可以邀請你喝點什麼嗎？
So maybe I should take you
for a drink or something?
算是慶祝吧
You know, celebrate.
嗯，也許可以
Yeah, maybe.
那我去收拾一下
I'll just get my things.
（此房出售）
我要帶上我的玩具馬車
I'm going to bring my doll carriage
那三隻復活節兔子，長頸鹿
and my three Easter rabbits
and my giraffe
還有所有的娃娃，娃娃房，還有蠟筆…
and all my dolls and my doll house
and my crayons...
也許可以把娃娃房給瑪德琳
I thought maybe
we'd give the doll house to Madeline.
我不想把娃娃房送給瑪德琳
I don't want to give the doll house
to Madeline.
我都跟你解釋過了
But I already explained to you,
那麼大的東西很難打包
the big things
are going to be hard to pack.
但可以把熊送給她
But she can have my bear,
- 還有那三隻復活節兔子
- 不行！挑有用的
- and my three Easter rabbits.
- No! Just the big things.
你怎麼不出去跟邁克玩？
Look. Wouldn't you rather go outside
and play with Michael?
- 我不喜歡
- 你整天都呆在屋子裡
- I don't feel like it.
- You've been inside all day.
我不喜歡
I don't feel like it.
我也不喜歡都對著
又煩又傻又不聽話的小孩
Well, I don't feel like
explaining everything 15 times
把每件事都解釋15遍以上！
to somebody who's too bored and silly
to listen!
- 行了，艾波爾，怎麼了這是？
- 沒事
- All right, April. What's the matter?
- Nothing.
我不信，今早發生什麼事了？
I don't believe you.
Did something happen this morning?
今天沒事，這麼久了我也不知道
Nothing happened today that I haven't
known about for days and days.
什麼？
What?
哦天，弗蘭克，別這麼詫異
Oh, God, Frank,
please don't look so dense.
你難道一點也沒感覺出來？
You mean you haven't guessed
or anything?
艾波爾，你到底在說什麼？
April, what are you talking about?
我又有了，就這樣
I'm pregnant, that's all.
什麼？
What?
弗蘭克，我本想等孩子們都上床了再告訴你
Frank, I meant to wait
till the kids were in bed to tell you,
但我…這幾天我已經差不多確定了
but I just...
Well, I've been pretty sure all week
然後今天我去看了醫生
and today I went to the doctor,
現在連我自己也不能假裝不知道了
and now I can't even pretend
it's not true.
- 多久了？
- 十周
- How long?
- Ten weeks.
十周，十周？你現在才告訴我？
Ten weeks. Ten weeks?
And you wait until now to tell me?
我以為…我不知道我怎麼想的
很抱歉弗蘭克，對不起
I thought... I don't know what I thought.
I'm sorry, Frank. I'm so sorry.
我知道你很抱歉，好吧？
I know. I know you are. All right?
現在還不算晚
There are things we can do.
這不會阻止我們離開的，對吧？
We don't have to let this stop us
from going, do we?
記得我告訴過你的那個女孩子嗎？
Remember that girl at school
I told you about?
只要12周之前做掉，就沒問題
As long as we take care of it
before 12 weeks, it's fine.
我們一定要齊心協力，弗蘭克
We've got to be together in this, Frank.
會有辦法的，好嗎？
Well, we'll figure it out. All right?
過來
Come here.
十二周，那我們還有時間做決定，對吧？
Twelve weeks.
So we have time to decide, right?
嗯
Right.
我愛你
I love you.
我也愛你
I love you, too.
弗蘭克，工作怎樣？
沒了你他們能幹的下去嗎？
So, Frank, how's work?
They gonna survive without you?
實際上呢，那天的事情很有趣
Actually, something kind of funny
happened the other day.
我就是耍了點小聰明
然後就逃離班迪的魔爪了
I did some dumb little piece of work
to get myself off the hook with Bandy,
突然間，我成了一個聰明的年輕人
and suddenly,
I'm the bright young man.
- 總有這種事，對吧？
- 真是不可思議
- That's always the way, ain't it?
- It's incredible.
我只花了幾分鐘寫出那些話
I mean, I knocked this thing off
in a couple of minutes
現在他們要我加入什麼專業銷售組
and now they want me to join
their team of "specialist" salesmen.
一群白癡
Morons.
當然了，要是他們不提出那麼高的薪水
Well, it would be funny
if they weren't offering
那才見鬼了
so much damn money.
那你動心了？
So, are you tempted?
有點諷刺對吧？
Well, it's just kind of ironic,
don't you think?
我以為你已經拒絕了
I thought you turned the job down.
還沒
Not yet.
只是個選擇，僅此而已
It's just an option, that's all.
如果真拿到那份薪水，我們的生活會不一樣的
With the kind of money they're talking,
things could be different for us here.
我們可以住得更好，可以旅遊
We could get a better place. Travel.
關鍵是，我們能快樂起來，至少會快樂一陣子
The point is, we could be happy here,
at least for a little while.
也許不只有巴黎人
It is possible that Parisians
aren't the only ones
能過上那麼有趣的生活，艾波爾
capable of leading
interesting lives, April.
那麼你是決定了？
So you've made up your mind?
不不，都說了只是一個選擇，僅此而已
No. No. Like I said, it's just an option.
That's all.
就算你說的沒錯
And supposing you're right.
你賺了很多錢，我們過得很開心
You make all this money
and we have this interesting life here.
那你還不是把生命都浪費在了
這份你覺得可笑的工作上？
Won't you still be wasting your life
toiling away at a job you find ridiculous?
也許我自己操心這些就行了，好吧？
Maybe we let that be my business,
all right?
你自己操心？
Your business?
太熱了，我得下水去
You know what? It's too hot for this.
I'm going to go get wet.
- 你根本不想走，對吧？
- 別這樣艾波爾，我當然想走
- You don't want to go, do you?
- Come on, April. Of course, I do.
不，你不想，你就是貪圖安逸
No, you don't.
Because you've never tried at anything.
你如果不做嘗試，就談不上失敗
And if you don't try at anything,
you can't fail.
你說我不去嘗試是什麼意思？
What the hell do you mean I don't try?
是我養你，沒錯吧？房子是我買的
I support you, don't I?
I pay for this house.
我一天10小時幹那無聊的工作
I work 10 hours a day
at a job I can't stand.
我一天10小時幹那無聊的工作
I work 10 hours a day
at a job I can't stand.
- 你沒必要這樣啊
- 狗屁！
- You don't have to.
- Bullshit!
聽著，我是不喜歡
Look, I'm not happy about it.
但我有骨氣，我清楚我自己的責任
But I have the backbone not to run away
from my responsibilities.
過自己想要的生活也需要骨氣，弗蘭克
It takes backbone
to lead the life you want, Frank.
你去哪裡？
Where are you going?
如果你不介意的話，艾波爾
我想去下洗手間，可以嗎？
If it's all right with you, April,
I'm gonna go use the bathroom. Okay?
你這是要幹嗎？
What the hell are you going to do
with this?
那你想怎樣？
And what do you think
you're going to do?
- 你要阻止我嗎？
- 他媽的說對了，我是要阻止你！
- You're going to stop me?
- You're damn right I am!
你來啊
Go ahead and try.
給我聽著艾波爾，你要是敢這樣
我發誓我會…
Listen to me. You do this, April,
you do this and I swear to God I'II...
你會怎樣？離開我？這是威脅還是保證？
You'll what? You'll leave me?
Is that a threat or a promise?
你什麼時候買的，艾波爾？
When did you buy this, April?
你買了多久了？告訴我！
How long have you had this?
I want to know!
老天爺
Jesus Christ.
你不要反應這麼劇烈好不好
You really are being melodramatic
about this whole thing.
只要是在十二周之內做掉，就完全安全
As long as it's done
in the first 12 weeks, it's perfectly safe.
- 那難道我就不能有我的意見？
- 當然可以！
- That's now, April! Don't I get a say?
- Of course you do!
這是為了你好，弗蘭克，你看不出來嗎？
It would be for you, Frank.
Don't you see?
這樣你就能有自己的時間，像我們說好的那樣
So you can have time,
just like we talked about.
看在上帝的分上
How can it be for me
when the thought of it
如果這事讓我覺得噁心，還能算是為我好嗎？
makes my stomach turn over,
for God's sake?
那算是為我自己
Then it's for me.
告訴我孩子會在巴黎出生，弗蘭克
Tell me we can have the baby
in Paris, Frank.
告訴我生活會變得不一樣
但別讓我留在這裡，求你了
Tell me we can have a different life.
But don't make me stay here. Please.
- 我們不能在巴黎生孩子
- 為什麼？
- We can't have the baby in Paris.
- Why not?
我不需要我們在這裡擁有的一切
我不在乎住在哪裡
I don't need everything we have here.
I don't care where we live.
再說，有誰規定我們必須怎樣嗎？
I mean, who made these rules, anyway?
我們搬來這裡，就是因為我懷孕了
Look, the only reason we moved
out here was because I got pregnant.
之後我們又生了一個
來證明第一個孩子不是個錯誤
Then we had another child to prove
the first one wasn't a mistake.
這到底何時是個盡頭？
I mean, how long does it go on?
弗蘭克，你真的還要一個孩子嗎？
Frank.
Do you actually want another child?
要嗎？來，告訴我
Well, do you? Come on, tell me.
實話告訴我，弗蘭克，你還記得嗎？
Tell me the truth, Frank.
Remember that?
我們一直很坦誠的
We used to live by it.
你知道說實話的好處嗎？
And you know what's so good
about the truth?
大家都知道什麼是實話，但都避而不談
Everyone knows what it is,
however long they've lived without it.
但沒有人能忘記事實，弗蘭克
他們只是越來越習慣撒謊
No one forgets the truth, Frank.
They just get better at lying.
請告訴我，你真的還想要一個孩子嗎？
So tell me,
do you really want another child?
我只知道自己的感覺
All I know is what I feel.
任何一個心智健全的人都會有這種感覺，艾波爾
And anyone else in their right mind
would feel the same way, April.
但我已經生了兩個了，這還不夠嗎？
But I've had two children.
Doesn't that count in my favour?
老天，艾波爾！你居然這麼想！
Christ, April!
The fact that you even put it that way!
照你的意思，生孩子好像是他媽的受罪
You make it seem as if having children
is some sort of a goddamn punishment.
我喜歡我的孩子，弗蘭克
I love my children, Frank.
你確定嗎，嗯？
And you're sure about that, huh?
你這話什麼意思？
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?
艾波爾，你剛說了我們的女兒是個錯誤
April, you just said our daughter
was a mistake.
我怎麼知道你沒想過拋棄她
How do I know you didn't try
to get rid of her,
- 或者甚至是邁克？
- 沒有
- or Michael for that matter?
- No.
我怎麼知道你沒想過把我們一家子
How do I know you didn't try to flush
our entire fucking family
- 都衝進廁所？
- 不，不是的，我沒這麼想過
- down the toilet?
- No, that's not true. Of course I didn't.
但我怎麼知道，艾波爾？
But how do I know, April?
別這樣，拜託了別這樣弗蘭克
Stop. Please just stop, Frank.
艾波爾，一個正常女人，一個心智健全的母親
April, a normal woman,
a normal sane mother
是不會為了想過他媽的幻想生活
doesn't buy a piece of rubber tubing
to give herself an abortion
而去買這種橡膠管
so she can live out
some kind of a goddamn fantasy.
聽著，我只是想說
這整件事上你看起來都不是很理智
Look, all I'm saying is you don't seem
entirely rational about this thing.
現在是時候找個人來
And I think it's about time
we found somebody
讓你的生活更有意義一點了
to help make some sense of your life.
你的新工作還能付得起這錢？
And the new job's going to
pay for that, too?
艾波爾，如果你需要精神醫生，那我掏錢
April, if you need a shrink,
it will be paid for.
沒問題
Obviously.
好吧，看來沒什麼可說的了，對吧？
Okay. I guess there isn't much more
to say then, is there?
看來巴黎這事是挺幼稚的，對吧？
So I guess Paris
was a pretty childish idea, huh?
我想也許是吧
I guess maybe it was.
艾波爾，我們在這裡也能快樂
April, we can be happy here.
我能讓你開心
I can make you happy here.
在這裡的這些日子我們很開心
沒必要就這麼結束
We've had a great couple of months.
It doesn't need to end.
我們會沒事的，我保證
We're going to be okay. I promise.
希望如此，弗蘭克
I hope so, Frank.
我真的希望如此
I really hope so.
久等了，波洛克先生可以見您了
Thank you for waiting.
Mr Pollock will see you now.
多謝
Thanks so much.
被意外的懷孕給攪黃了
Foiled by faulty contraception.
不得不為你感到遺憾
I can't say that I'm sorry.
否則看到你的小工位，我們會想你的
You'd have been sorely missed
in the old cubicle, I can tell you that.
沒了你一切都會變的
Wouldn't have been the same
without you.
此外，嗯…
Besides... Well...
怎麼？
What?
你們的計劃看起來
總讓人覺得有點不切實際，對吧？
The plan always seemed
a touch unrealistic, don't you think?
看來我多嘴了
I suppose
it's none of my business, really.
的確，這是我們自己的事
No. No. I suppose it isn't.
那麼…
Well...
他們應該在秘書室慶祝過了
They'll be celebrating
in the secretarial pool.
嗨，記得你第一次帶我們來這裡嗎？
Hey! Remember the first time
you brought us here?
當然
Absolutely.
你說一般人體會不出維多的小木屋的好
You said it takes a special kind of taste
to enjoy Vito's Log Cabin.
太狠毒了，真好笑
It's so awful, it's kind of nice.
看看，我真是太高興了
我們的小圈子終於不會解散了
Look at me. I'm just so happy.
Our little gang's back together again.
- 反正歐洲又不會消失
- 沒錯
- Hey, Europe's not going anywhere.
- That's right.
艾波爾，親愛的，跳個舞如何？
April, honey, how about a dance?
現在不想，待會兒吧
Not right now. Maybe later.
- 我來跳
- 好
- I'll dance.
- Okay.
看來她還是忘不了巴黎，嗯？
Guess she's still pretty blue
about Paris, huh?
她不會有事吧？
Think she'll be okay?
當然，假以時日，都會忘掉的
Sure. Give us girls a couple of days
and we can get over anything.
對
Right.
弗蘭克
Frank.
弗蘭克
Frank.
弗蘭克
Frank.
弗蘭克
Frank.
你沒事吧，米莉？
Are you okay? Are you okay? Milly?
抱歉
I'm so sorry.
失陪了
Excuse me.
這下好了
That's just great.
現在該怎麼出去？
How the hell
are we supposed to get out now?
哦天
Oh, boy.
沒事，薛普，我們可以等著
Don't worry about it, Shep.
We can wait. Really.
那保姆呢？
What about the sitter?
這樣，你帶米莉回去，然後自己回家
Listen, why don't you drive Milly home,
then go home yourself.
這樣兩家的保姆都能照看到
薛普一會兒送我回去
That takes care of both sitters.
Then Shep can take me home later.
- 嗯，我同意
- 那好吧
- Yeah, it's fine by me.
- Okay, then.
- 你…沒事？
- 當然
- You... You'll be all right?
- Sure.
好
Okay.
- 晚安
- 晚安
- Good night.
- Good night.
趕快好起來
Feel better.
很遺憾你哪裡也去不了了
I'm sorry you're not
going away any more.
我知道這對你很重要
I know it was important to you.
別誤會，不過我也去過那裡
Don't take this wrong,
but I've been there.
我們沒有的，他們基本也沒有
They don't have so much
we don't have here.
不是一定要去巴黎
It didn't have to be Paris.
你就是想離開，對吧？
You just wanted out, huh?
我想回去
I wanted in.
我想回到我們自己的生活
I just wanted us to live again.
這麼多年來，我以為我們心有默契
For years,
I thought we shared this secret.
我以為我們能過得很精彩
That we would be
wonderful in the world.
我不知道具體怎麼做，但…
I didn't exactly know how, but just...
我就是有這種信念
Just the possibility kept me hoping.
很可悲是吧？
How pathetic is that?
真傻
So stupid.
把所有的希望寄托在從未許下的諾言上？
To put all your hopes in a promise
that was never made?
不過弗蘭克很清楚，他知道自己想要什麼
See, Frank knows.
He knows what he wants.
他找到了自己的位置，所以安心了
He's found his place. He's just fine.
結婚了，生了兩個孩子了
Married, two kids.
這就已經夠了
It should be enough.
對他來說如此
It is for him.
他是對的
And he's right.
我們是普通人，注定這麼過一輩子
We were never special or destined
or anything at all.
不，你們不普通
Yes, you are.
你們是…
You're...
你們是惠勒夫婦
You're the Wheelers.
你們是多美滿的一對，大家都這麼說
You're a terrific couple.
Everybody says so.
我看到了另一種未來
I saw a whole other future.
我止不住去憧憬
I can't stop seeing it.
走不了
Can't leave,
也留不住
can't stay.
廢物一個
No damn use to anyone.
來吧
Come on.
跳支舞
Let's do it.
我帶你去別的地方
Let me take you somewhere.
不，這裡就行了，來吧
No. Just do it here. Now.
艾波爾
April.
這是我一直想要的
This is what I've always wanted.
我愛你
I love you.
別這麼說
Don't say that.
不，我說真的，我愛你
No. I mean it, I love you.
求你了，安靜一會兒
Please, just be quiet for a minute.
然後帶我回去
Then you can take me home.
天氣不錯啊
It's beautiful out.
沒錯
Yes, it is.
知道今天什麼日子嗎？
You know what today is?
- 十二周了
- 沒錯
- It's 12 weeks.
- That's right.
這個夏天可夠瘋狂的
Look, this has been
kind of a crazy summer.
我們壓力都很大
We've both been under a strain.
我是說，我知道你為什麼不安
I mean, I understand why you're upset.
你知道我沒和你睡，你想知道為什麼
You know I'm not sleeping with you,
and you want to know why.
對不起，弗蘭克，我真的不想說這些
Well, I'm sorry, Frank,
but I really don't feel like talking about it.
好吧，那我們聊點什麼，艾波爾？
All right.
Then what should we talk about, April?
什麼也不說可以嗎？
Would it be all right
if we didn't talk about anything?
我的意思是，迎接每一天的到來
盡力做好自己的事，可以嗎？
I mean, can't we just take each day
as it comes, and do the best we can,
不要總覺得我們該聊點什麼
and not feel like we have to talk
about everything all the time?
我好像沒有要一直聊天的意思吧
I don't think I'm suggesting that
we talk about everything all the time.
聽著，我的意思是我們倆壓力都很大
Look, my point is we've both been
under a strain
現在應該盡力幫助對方
and we ought to be helping each other
out as much as we can right now.
我最近的舉止可能有些奇怪
I mean, God knows my own behaviour
has been pretty weird lately.
實際上呢，我想和你說件事
As a matter of fact, there is something
I'd like to tell you about.
我和一個女孩好過幾次，在城裡
I've been with a girl a few times,
in the city.
一個我幾乎不瞭解的女孩
A girl I hardly even know.
逢場作戲而已
It was nothing to me,
已經過去了，真的
but it's over now, really over.
如果我不確定的話，我應該是不會告訴你的
And if I weren't sure of that, I guess
I could never have told you about it.
你為什麼這麼做？
Why did you?
寶貝，我也不知道
Baby, I don't know.
也許很簡單，流產的事情之後
I think it's a simple case
of wanting to be a man again
我想再一次成為男人
after all that abortion business.
有一種很變態的需求要證明什麼
Some kind of neurotic,
irrational need to prove something.
我不是說你為什麼有了外遇
No. I don't mean
why did you have the girl.
我是說你為什麼跟我說這些？
I mean, why did you tell me about it?
- 你什麼意思？
- 你到底想表達什麼？
- What do you mean?
- I mean, what's the point?
是想要我嫉妒還是怎麼著？
Is it supposed to make me jealous
or something?
是想讓我再次愛上你
Is it supposed to make me
fall in love with you,
再和你上床，還是怎麼著？
or back into bed with you, or what?
你到底想讓我說什麼，弗蘭克？
I mean,
what would you like me to say, Frank?
你為什麼不說說自己的感受，艾波爾？
Why don't you say what you feel, April?
我沒什麼感受
I don't feel anything.
換句話說，你不在乎我做了什麼
不在乎我干了誰，什麼都不在乎？
In other words, you don't care what I do
or who I fuck or anything?
也許是吧，我不在乎
No, I guess that's right. I don't.
愛干誰幹誰
Fuck who you like.
艾波爾，難道你不明白我需要你在乎我？
April, don't you understand
that I want you to care?
我明白，我知道你需要
I know. I know you do.
我想如果我愛你的話，我是會在乎你的
And I suppose I would if I loved you.
但我應該不再愛你了，我剛剛才想明白
But I don't think I do any more.
And I only just figured that out.
所以我不想再說什麼了
And that's why I'd just as soon
not do any talking right now.
別跟我說這些屁話，艾波爾，少來這套
Don't give me that shit, April.
Don't give me that.
- 你他媽心裡是愛我的
- 你真這麼覺得？
- You know goddamn well you love me.
- You think so?
你他媽心裡清楚！
You know goddamn well!
家裡有人嗎？
Anyone home?
抱歉飯還沒好，還有人要喝點什麼嗎？
I'm sorry dinner's late.
Would anyone like another drink?
沒事，坐坐聊聊挺好的
Don't worry.
It's nice to just sit a bit and socialise.
沒必要搞這麼麻煩
You shouldn't have gone to
all this trouble.
東西應該都收拾好了
With all your packing and whatnot.
現在應該只有盤子可以用了吧
說笑而已
I imagine you have a lot on your plate.
No pun intended.
實際上計劃有所變動
Actually, there's been
a change of plans.
我還以為很明顯呢
I thought maybe it was obvious.
艾波爾懷孕了
April here is pregnant.
- 恭喜啊
- 噢，艾波爾
- Congratulations.
- Oh, April!
知道我有多高興嗎！
I can't tell you how pleased I am!
看樣子你們需要一間大一點的房子了，對吧？
But I expect you'll be needing
a bigger house now, won't you?
等等，媽，等一下
Hold it a second, Ma.
Hold on a second, Ma.
我不明白了，有什麼明顯的？
I don't get this.
I mean, what's so obvious about it?
她是懷孕了，但又怎樣呢？
難道歐洲人就不懷孕了？
I mean, okay, she's pregnant, so what?
Don't people have babies in Europe?
- 約翰…
- 這麼說吧
- John...
- Suppose we just say
不管哪裡的人，如果供養不起
that people anywhere
aren't very well advised to have babies
一般是不會要孩子的
unless they can afford them.
好吧好吧，是錢的問題，錢是個好理由
Okay. Okay, it's a question of money.
Money's a good reason.
但這從不是真正的原因
But it's hardly ever the real reason.
到底是為什麼？老婆說服你不去了？
What's the real reason?
Wife talk you out of it or what?
小女人覺得她還是過家家比較好？
Little woman decide she isn't
quite ready to quit playing house?
不不，應該不是，我看得出來
No, no, that's not it. I can tell.
她看起來很堅決的樣子
She looks too tough
and adequate as hell.
那應該是你的問題了，怎麼了？
Okay, then. It must've been you.
What happened?
- 拜託約翰，你太粗魯了
- 不不，怎麼了，弗蘭克？
- John, please. You're being very rude.
- No, no. What happened, Frank?
你害怕了？
You get cold feet?
你覺得還是在這裡好？
You decide
you're better off here after all?
你覺得還是守著這
You figure it's more comfy
令人絕望的空虛生活比較好，嗯？
here in the old hopeless emptiness
after all, huh?
猜對了，看看他的臉
Oh, wow, that did it. Look at his face.
怎麼了，惠勒？被我說中了？
What's the matter, Wheeler?
Am I getting warm?
- 夠了兒子，我看我們還是…
- 知道不？
- All right, Son. I think we'd better be...
- You know something?
如果說他是故意讓她懷孕
I wouldn't be surprised
if he knocked her up on purpose
從而能夠安穩的過一輩子
我一點也不奇怪
just so he could spend the rest of his
life hiding behind a maternity dress.
這樣他就用不著去尋找真實的自我
That way he'd never have to find out
what he's really made of.
行了，我看你也說夠了吧
Now look, I think that's just about
enough out of you.
你他媽的以為自己是誰？
I mean, who the hell
do you think you are?
你到我家來
You come in here and say
滿口胡言亂語，說話不經大腦
whatever crazy goddamn thing
comes into your head,
我看該是有人讓你閉上臭嘴的時候了
and I think it's about time somebody told
you to keep your goddamn mouth shut.
- 他有病，弗蘭克
- 有屁個病！
- He's not well, Frank.
- Not well, my ass!
我可不管他是有病是活著還是死了
I don't give a damn
if he's sick or well or dead or alive,
他這些狗屁廢話
he should keep his fucking opinions
就該他媽的留到精神病院去說！
in the fucking insane asylum
where they belong!
- 我們走，兒子
- 走吧，約翰
- Let's go, Son.
- Come on, John.
你老公很猛啊，艾波爾
Big man you got there, April.
大男人
Big family man.
我為你感到遺憾
I feel sorry for you.
不過，也許你們還真是配
Still, maybe you deserve each other.
看到你這樣子，我也開始為他感到遺憾了
I mean, the way you look right now,
I'm beginning to feel sorry for him, too.
如果靠造人才能證明自己是真男人的話
You must give him a pretty bad time
你一定讓他很不好過
if making babies is the only way
he can prove he's got a pair of balls.
- 你媽個…
- 別這樣！他病了，弗蘭克
- You fucking...
- No! He's not well, Frank!
好了約翰，我們走吧
All right, John.
Let's get on out to the car now.
艾波爾，對不起，真的對不起
April, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
噢對，對不起，對不起，對不起！
Oh, right. Sorry. Sorry! Sorry!
媽，我說夠「對不起」了嗎？
Ma, have I said
"I'm sorry" enough times?
操！我是很可悲
Damn! I am sorry, too.
我可能是我認識的最可憐的王八蛋了
I bet I'm just about
the sorriest bastard I know.
不過話說回來
我他媽的也沒有什麼可高興的
But get right down to it, I don't have
a whole hell of a lot to be glad about.
是吧？
Do I?
不過你知道不？
But, hey, you know what?
有件事我很高興
I am glad about one thing.
知道我高興什麼嗎？
You want to know what I'm glad about?
我高興我不是那孩子
I'm glad I'm not gonna be that kid.
好吧，別告訴我
Okay, okay, don't tell me.
別告訴我，讓我自己猜
Don't tell me, let me guess.
我大出洋相了，對吧？
I made a disgusting spectacle
of myself, right?
嗯
Right.
那男的說的都是對的，是吧？
And everything that man said
is true, right?
你是不是想這麼說？
Is that what you're going to say?
很明顯我沒必要說
Apparently I don't have to.
- 你都替我說了
- 那你錯了，艾波爾
- You're saying it for me.
- Well, you're wrong, April.
- 是嗎？我為什麼錯了？
- 因為那男的瘋了
- Really? Why am I wrong?
- Because the man is insane.
他他媽的瘋了！
你知道瘋了是什麼意思嗎？
He's fucking insane! Do you know what
the definition of insanity is?
不知道，你知道？
No. Do you?
是的，就是無法和別人正常交往
Yes, it's the inability
to relate to another human being.
就是無法去愛
It's the inability to love.
艾波爾，艾波爾
April. April.
艾波爾！艾波爾！
April! April!
沒法去…沒法去愛
The inability... The inability to love.
弗蘭克，你真能忽悠
Frank. You really are a wonderful talker.
如果想把死人說活
If black could be made into white
by talking,
那你再適合不過了
you'd be the man for the job.
所以我瘋了，因為我不愛你，對吧？
So now I'm crazy
because I don't love you. Right?
- 你是不是這個意思？
- 不是
- Is that the point?
- No. Wrong.
你沒瘋，你愛我
我是這個意思，艾波爾
You're not crazy and you do love me.
That's the point, April.
但我不愛你，我恨你
But I don't. I hate you.
你只是一個在酒會上博我一笑的男孩
You were just some boy
who made me laugh at a party once
現在我再也不想看到你
and now I loathe the sight of you.
如果你再靠近，如果你碰我或怎樣
In fact, if you come any closer,
if you touch me or anything,
我會喊的
I think I'll scream.
別這樣，行了，艾波爾
Come on. Stop this, April.
我操你媽，艾波爾！
Fuck you, April!
我操你媽個…
Fuck you and all your hateful,
snotty little...
你現在想怎樣？想打我？
What're you going to do now?
Are you going to hit me?
- 來表達你有多愛我？
- 被擔心，我不會自找麻煩
- To show me how much you love me?
- Don't worry, I can't be bothered!
你根本不值得我打你
You're not worth the trouble
it would take to hit you.
你根本不值得我發脾氣
You're not worth the powder
it would take to blow you up.
你是個空虛的女人！
You're an empty, empty,
hollow shell of a woman!
你要是這麼恨我，為什麼還在我的房子裡？
What the hell are you doing in my house
if you hate me so much?
為什麼還要嫁給我？
Why the hell are you married to me?
為什麼還要懷我的孩子？
What the hell are you doing
carrying my child?
你早幹嘛不做掉他？
I mean, why didn't you just get
rid of it when you had the chance?
聽我說，聽我說，我他媽告訴你
Because listen to me.
Listen to me, I got news for you.
我真希望你做掉了
I wish to God that you had.
艾波爾！
April!
艾波爾！
April!
艾波爾！
April!
艾波爾！
April!
艾波爾！
April!
艾波爾！
April!
- 艾波爾！
- 別靠近我
- April!
- Stay away from me.
- 聽我說，艾波爾
- 別靠近我
- April, listen.
- Stay away from me.
我他媽的在樹林裡也躲不了你嗎？
Can't I even get away from you
in the fucking woods?
聽著，艾波爾，我亂說的
April, listen, I didn't mean that.
- 真的，我不是有意的
- 你還要說是吧？
- Honestly, I didn't mean what I said.
- Are you still talking?
你就不能閉嘴嗎？
Isn't there any way to stop your talking?
我要冷靜一下，你看不出來嗎？
我要冷靜一下
I need to think. Can't you see that?
I need to think.
先回屋裡去吧
你在外面幹什麼，艾波爾？
Please come back to the house.
What're you doing out here, April?
你是不是要我再喊，弗蘭克？
Do you want me to scream again,
Frank?
我會的！我說真的！
Because I will! I mean it!
好吧，好吧
Okay. Okay.
早上好
Good morning.
早上好
Good morning.
你要炒雞蛋還是荷包蛋？
Would you like
scrambled eggs or fried?
不知道
I don't know.
無所謂了，炒吧，如果這樣容易
It doesn't really matter.
Scrambled, I guess, if it's easy.
好吧，我也吃炒的
Fine. I'll have scrambled, too.
沒有小孩在，吃早飯真開心，是吧？
It's kind of nice having breakfast
without the kids for a change, huh?
嗯
Yes.
我想你今天也許要吃頓好的早飯
I thought you'd probably want
a good breakfast today.
今天對你來說很重要，對吧？
I mean, it's kind of an important day
for you, isn't it?
今天不是要和波洛克開會嗎？
Isn't this the day you have
your conference with Pollock?
對，沒錯
Yes. Yes, that's right.
- 大事啊
- 我想應該是挺大的事
- Big deal.
- I imagine it is a pretty big deal.
不過是對他們而言
For them, anyway.
你這新工作到底要做什麼？
What exactly do you think
you'll be doing in your new job?
你還沒跟我仔細說過
You haven't really
told me much about it.
沒有嗎？
Haven't I?
其實整件事呢，就是諾克斯公司
Well, I think this whole thing
is about Knox getting ready
打算買一台那種大型計算機
to buy up one of those
really big computers,
比500型還要大的那種
even bigger than the 500.
- 我沒跟你說過？
- 沒
- Didn't I tell you about that?
- No.
不如現在告訴我？
Why don't you tell me now?
是這樣
Well,
實際上呢，這是個很大，很快的加法器
you know, basically it's just a big,
fast adding machine.
只不過原先使用的機械零件
Only, instead of mechanical parts,
you see,
被替換成了成千個真空管
you've got thousands
of individual vacuum tubes.
明白了
I see.
至少我覺得明白了
At least I think I see.
這真有意思，是吧？
Yes, it's really kind of interesting,
isn't it?
我也不知道
Well, I don't know.
也許從某方面來說，是有點意思吧
Yeah, I guess it is kind of interesting,
in a way.
你應該重視你的工作，弗蘭克
You should value what you do, Frank.
很顯然你在行
You're obviously good at it.
那麼我也許該走了？
Well, I guess
I'd better be getting started, huh?
聽著，艾波爾…
Listen, though, April, the...
這樣真的很好
This was really nice.
我是說，很好的早飯，我真的…
I mean, it was a swell breakfast.
Really, I...
我不記得什麼時候吃過這麼好的早飯了
I don't know when I've ever had
a nicer breakfast.
謝謝你，我也很滿足
Thank you. I enjoyed it, too.
那你不…不再恨我了？
Then you don't...
You don't hate me or anything?
不，當然不會
No. No, of course I don't.
祝你順利
Have a good day.
那好，再見了
Okay, then. So long.
你好，米莉？都還好吧？
Hello. Milly? Everything all right?
我好像並沒有好轉，所以我才打給你
Well, no, I'm afraid I'm not feeling
any better. That's really why I called.
如果方便的話，今晚就可以
If it's not an inconvenience for you,
this evening would be great.
什麼？
What?
噢不，他們要是在外面玩就算了
Oh, no. No.
Not if they're outdoors playing.
不用了
No.
別把他們叫進來
Don't call them in.
替我親親他們倆
Just give them each a kiss for me,
然後告訴他們我…
and tell them I...
告訴他們…
Tell them...
你知道了，好，謝謝，再見
You know. All right. All right.
Thank you, Milly. Bye.
我需要幫助
I think I need help.
革命路115號
115 Revolutionary Road.
- 弗蘭克，他們都告訴你了？
- 老天啊
- Frank. They tell you what happened?
- Jesus Christ.
薛普，他們說的我都沒大聽懂
Shep, I didn't understand
half the things he told me.
他們說到家的時候胎兒已經出來了
He said the foetus was out
before they got her here.
然後他們只好手術取出那個什麼，胎盤？
And they had to operate to take out
the, what do you call it, the placenta?
然後現在還在出血
And now she's still bleeding.
他說救護車到的時候已經流了很多血了
He said that she'd lost a lot of blood
before the ambulance came,
他們現在在想辦法止血
and now they're trying to stop it.
他說了一堆什麼毛細血管之類的東西…
He said a whole lot of things
I didn't understand about capillaries...
他說她昏迷了，老天
He said that she's unconscious. Jesus.
好了，弗蘭克，你先坐下吧？
Okay, Frank,
why don't you just take a seat?
我他媽的為什麼要坐下？
What the hell do I want to sit down for,
for God's sake?
放鬆點，弗蘭克，放鬆點
Okay, Frank. Just take it easy.
Take it easy.
- 來根煙，弗蘭克
- 她自己動手的，薛普
- Frank, have a cigarette.
- She did it to herself, Shep.
她自己動手的
She did it to herself.
我去給你來杯咖啡
I'm gonna get you some coffee.
他們真是美滿的一對，是吧薛普？
They were such wonderful people.
Weren't they, Shep?
太可怕了，可憐的艾波爾
It's just devastating. Poor April.
謝謝
Thank you.
弗蘭克現在住在城裡了
他在哪裡工作來著？
Frank lives in the city now.
Where is it that he works?
- 巴特·波洛克聯合公司
- 電腦？
- Bart Pollock Associates.
- Computers?
有意思的公司
Interesting firm.
- 你有沒有再見到他？
- 沒，沒回來過
- Have you seen him since?
- No. Not back here.
我想那裡有太多回憶了
薛普在城裡見過他
There are too many memories, I think.
Shep has seen him in the city.
是吧，親愛的？
Haven't you, sweetie?
弗蘭克現在全心撫養孩子了
Frank is just devoted to those kids.
一有時間就陪著他們
Every spare moment he has,
he spends with them.
失陪一下
Excuse me.
你還好吧？
You all right?
我不想再談論惠勒夫婦了
I don't want to talk
about the Wheelers any more.
好
Okay.
沒必要談
We don't have to.
沒必要談
We don't have to.
爸爸，爸爸，看啊爸爸
Daddy, Daddy, watch. Watch, Daddy.
革命路上的那間小屋子
I can't tell you how pleased I am
我真的很滿意，霍華德
about the little Revolutionary Road
place, Howard.
每次路過那裡，看到一切都再次井然有序
And now whenever I drive past,
it gives me such a lift
和諧安寧，我就很欣慰
to see it all perked up
and spanking clean again.
看看屋裡透出的那些亮光
All the lights in all the windows.
知道嗎？我剛在想
我對這小房子鍾愛了這麼多年
And do you know? I was just thinking,
I've loved that little house for years.
佈雷斯夫婦是我找到的最適合它的主人
And the Braces are the only really
suitable people I've ever found for it.
真的很友善，很美滿的一對
Really nice, congenial people, I mean.
你是說除了惠勒夫婦
Well, except for the Wheelers,
you mean.
我很喜歡惠勒夫婦
I was very fond of the Wheelers.
不過在我看來他們有點古怪，神經質
They were a bit whimsical for my taste.
A bit neurotic.
我從沒和人這麼說過
I never stressed it, but they were often
不過很多時候，他們讓我很討厭
very trying people
to deal with, in many ways.
當然了，這小屋子這麼難賣掉
And actually, the main reason
that the little house was so hard to sell
就是因為他們讓它迅速貶值了
was because they let it depreciate
so dreadfully.
扭曲的窗框，潮濕的地下室，佈滿塗鴉的牆壁
Warped window frames, wet cellar,
crayon marks all over the walls,
還有門把上、衛生間裡的污點…
filthy smudges around the door knobs
and the fixtures...
