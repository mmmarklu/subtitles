紐約的各位...
What's up...
大家好
New York?
還有從Brooklyn趕來的
There's Brooklyn in the house.
我也是Brooklyn人
Well, l'm from Brooklyn.
看啊 今晚白人都躲去兩樓了
Shit, look at this. White people are up top tonight.
剛剛我從賓館趕來...
You know, I was just in my hotel, a little while ago, on my way here...
坐電梯對吧?
and I got in the elevator, right?
我上了電梯...
I'm getting in the elevator...
後面兩個讀高中的白小子想跟進來...
and these two high-school white boys try to get on with me...
我立馬閃了
and l just dove off.
"你們可別想殺我!"
I said, "Y'all ain't killing me!"
我怕了白小子了
I am scared of young white boys.
碰到不滿21歲的白人 我跑的比誰都快
If you white and under 21, I am running for the hills.
熊孩子們成天犯校園槍殺案 想啥呢?
What the hell is wrong with these white kids shooting up the school?
也不等放學的
They don't even wait till 3:00, either.
上課殺人 這可不對
Killing people in the morning. That ain't right.
什麼風衣黑手黨
The Trench Coat Mafia.
還說 "沒人跟我們玩"
"No one will play with us."
"沒有朋友 孤獨的風衣黑手黨啊"
"We have no friends. We're the Trenchcoat Mafia."
我看你們年鑒了 明明有六個成員
Hey, I saw the yearbook pictures. It was six of them.
我高中都沒有六個朋友
I didn't have six friends in high school.
我現在都沒有
I don't got six friends now.
都可以佔半場玩三打三籃球了
Shit, that's three-on-three with a half court.
熊孩子們想啥呢?
What the hell is wrong with these kids?
總有人跟我說 "Chris 去學校跟孩子們談談吧"
I got people telling me, "Come on, Chris. Come up to a school. Talk to the kids."
我就說 "去他丫的!"
I'm like, "Fuck the kids!
"去演講有配防彈背心嗎? 那我考慮考慮"
"Do you got a vest? Maybe I'll think about it."
大家都想瞭解孩子們聽什麼
Everybody wants to know what the kids was listening to.
聽什麼歌?
What kind of music was they listening to?
看什麼電影?
Or what kind of movies was they watching?
誰管他們看什麼啊?
Who gives a fuck what they was watching?
就是一幫問題少年
Whatever happened to crazy?
問題少年怎麼沒人提? 現在沒有了?
What happened to crazy? What, you can't be crazy no more?
沒有"問題少年"這個說法了?
Did we eliminate "crazy" from the dictionary?
關音樂啥事 關電影啥事 就是問題少年!
Fuck the records. Fuck the movies. Crazy!
我小時候 問題少年會被單獨拎出來
When I was a kid, they used to separate the crazy kids from everybody.
那時候 他們都坐小破巴士上學
When I was a kid, the crazy kids went to school in a little-ass bus.
他們的教室在最後面...
They had a class at the end of the school...
兩點半就下課了
and they used to get out of school at 2:30.
萬一他們發起瘋來...
Just in case they went crazy...
也只會傷到其他問題少年
they would only hurt other crazy kids.
當年我們很安全
And we was all safe.
當年很安全 現在全都亂了套
We was all safe. Damn, the world's coming to an end.
現在還有白人小孩說
You'll have little white kids saying,
"我要跟黑人一個學校 比較安全"
"I want to go to a black school where it's safe."
是的 各位
That's right, man.
大家都說要槍支管制 都不許拿槍
And everybody's talking about gun control, got to get rid of the guns.
去他的 我愛槍
Fuck that. I like guns.
有把槍 就不用健身了
You got a gun, you don't have to work out.
我不健身 不慢跑
I ain't working out. I ain't jogging.
你有胸肌 我有武器
You got pecs, I got Tecs.
去他的 槍支不需要管制
Fuck that shit. You don't need no gun control.
其實吧 子彈才需要管制
You know what you need? We need some bullet control.
子彈管制 對的
Man, we need to control the bullets, that's right.
子彈一發賣五千刀
I think all bullets should cost $5,000.
一發五千 為啥?
$5,000 for a bullet. You know why?
因為一發五千的話 就沒有無辜群眾受傷了
'Cause if a bullet costs $5,000, there'd be no more innocent bystanders.
就是這樣
That'd be it.
這樣再有人被槍殺 大家就會說 "這貨肯定沒幹好事啊"
Every time someone gets shot, people will be like, "Damn, he must have did something."
"殺他用了五萬刀的子彈啊"
"Shit, they put $50,000 worth of bullets in his ass."
這樣 兇手殺人也要三思了
People would think before they killed somebody, if a bullet cost $5,000.
"要是我有錢 我就把你頭打爆了"
"Man, I would blow your fucking head off, if I could afford it."
"我這就去打第二份工 等攢夠了錢..."
"I'm gonna get me another job, I'm gonna start saving some money..."
"你就等死吧"
"and you're a dead man."
"你就祈禱子彈沒法按揭吧"
"You better hope I can't get no bullets on layaway."
你要是躺槍了...
So even if you get shot by a stray bullet...
你都不用讓醫生給你取出來
you won't have to go to no doctor to get it taken out.
開槍的會把子彈要回去的
Whoever shot you would take their bullet back.
"您侵佔了我的財產哦"
"I believe you got my property."
就是這樣
That's right, man.
現在大家都罵問題少年
See, everybody blames the kids as fucking crazy.
校園槍殺案大家都怪孩子
Everybody wants to be mad at the kids for shooting up the school.
家長的責任呢? 家長們
What about the parents? The parents.
家長才操蛋吧
The parents is really fucked up, man.
他們的家長都該坐牢
Their damn parents need to go to jail for some of this fucking shit, man.
只要認識坐牢的問題少年的
Cause everybody knows that crazy-ass kid that went to jail.
都會說 "他也可憐啊"
You go, "Man, he ain't never had a chance."
"你看他媽這個樣子 他早晚要進去的"
"If you'd known his mama, you'd know he gonna be there."
有天我在Life夜店 氣氛很嗨
I was at the club the other night, down at Life, chilling at the club.
旁邊有個姑娘 她在那跳舞
I'm chilling with this girl. She was dancing.
大概凌晨兩點 她跟我說她家還有兩個孩子
It was about 2:00 a.m. I'm talking to her, and realized she had two kids at home.
把兩個孩子放家裏我無所謂
I don't mind the two kids at home, that's all good.
但我想 "你TM在夜店幹嘛..."
But I'm like, "What the fuck are you doing in a club..."
"這可是週三凌晨兩點"
"at 2:00 in the fucking morning on a Wednesday night?"
"你在這幹嘛呢?"
"What the fuck are you doing here?"
"你今天過生日?"
"Is it your birthday?"
"你加薪了?"
"Did you get a raise?"
"趕緊給我回去"
"Well, you got to get the fuck out."
"快走 我要把你轟出去 拜!"
"You go. I'm kicking you the fuck out. Yes, bye!"
"好好帶孩子 免得十年後他們來打劫我了"
"Go take care of them kids before they rob me in 10 years."
生娃不泡吧 泡吧不生娃
You got to get your kid on or your groove on.
哪有這麼不負責任的 受夠了
You can't get both on at the same time. I'm tired of this shit.
現在女人們還說什麼
And a bunch of girls are like:
"不靠男人 自己能帶好小孩"
"You don't need no man to help you raise no child."
別TM放屁了
Shut the fuck up with the bullshit.
帶是能帶 那你也帶不好
Yeah, you can do it without a man but that don't mean it's to be done.
艸 我開車還能用腳把方向盤呢
Shit, you could drive a car with your feet if you want to.
但我會這麼上路嗎
That don't make it a good fucking idea.
就算你是世界上最強勢的媽媽
I don't give a fuck. You could be the baddest mama on earth.
我也不在乎
I don't give a fuck how good you are.
再怎樣也敵不過一句 "當心我告訴你爸"
Ain't nothing you can say more powerful than, "I'm gonna tell your daddy."
敵不過的啊
Can't fuck with it.
殺傷力完全比不上 "當心我告訴你爸"
Can't come close to, "I'm gonna tell your daddy."
你拿槍頂著小屁孩腦門說 "當心我打爆你頭"
You can have a gun at the kid's head, "I'll blow your fucking head off."
- "那又怎樣?"  - "當心我告訴你爸"
- "So what?"  - "I'll tell your daddy."
"服了 服了"
"Okay, okay."
敵不過的
Can't fuck with it, man.
我受夠了 工作日晚上總能在夜店...
I'm tired of bumping into these girls at the club...
碰到這些當媽的
all late on a fucking weeknight.
我有個表弟一年級就跟不上
I got a little cousin who got left back in the first grade.
一年級就跟不上啊...
Left back in the first grade...
因為他媽愛泡吧
cause his mama's out getting the groove on.
到底得多蠢...
You know how dumb you got to be...
才會一年級都跟不上啊?
to get left back in the first grade?
- "四加四是幾?"  - "果凍"
- "What's four plus four?"  - "Jell-O."
但這不是他的錯 是他媽的錯
But that ain't his fault. That's the mama's fault.
都是他媽的錯
That's the mama's fucking fault. That's right.
我總跟他媽說 "Tina 跟孩子說說話啊"
I'm telling my cousin, "Tina, talk to your fucking kid."
"說說話唄 教點什麼"
"Talk to him, teach him some shit."
"除了一句'媽媽馬上回來' 再說點別的..."
"If you said more words to him than,'Mommy be back'..."
"他不會這麼蠢"
"he might know something."
就是這樣
That's right.
那些要完蛋的孩子也很容易看得出來
And it's real easy to tell who kids are gonna be fucked up.
不需要什麼專家來分析的
It don't take no scientist to tell who's gonna have some fucked-up kids.
如果這小孩喊奶奶"媽咪"...
If the kid calls his grandmamma "Mommy"...
喊他媽大名 他肯定要進去的
and his mama "Pam," he's going to jail.
你不是在攢大學學費 攢的是保釋金吧
You ain't saving no college money, you saving bail money.
錢都流進律師口袋裏
That money's going to Johnnie Cochran.
要是小孩不認字 那就是媽媽的錯
That's right. If the kid can't read, that's Mama's fault.
肯定是媽媽的錯
That is Mama's fucking fault.
要是小孩沒有燈看書而不認字...
Now, if the kid can't read cause there ain't no lights in the house...
那就是爸爸的錯
that's Daddy's fault.
聽懂了嗎?
You got this shit down?
沒人感謝爸爸 這年頭好爸爸還是有的
See, nobody gives a fuck about Daddy. There's some real daddies out there.
我不是說那些上完就跑的
I'm not talking about the guy that fucked you and left.
去他丫的 我是說那些好爸爸
Fuck him, okay? I'm talking about the real daddies.
還是有些人在盡父親的職責
There's still some motherfuckers out there that handle their business.
像男人一樣...
Motherfuckers wanna act like brothers...
盡到父親職責的
There's some brothers that handle their business.
沒人關心... 沒人在乎父親
Cause people don't give a fuck... Nobody gives a fuck about Daddy.
沒人感謝父親 你聽電台放的歌
Everybody takes Daddy for granted. Just listen to the radio.
全都是 "媽媽 親愛的媽媽 永遠愛你"
Everything's "Mama. Dear Mama. Always loved my Mama."
寫父親的有什麼歌? "滾石老爸"
What's the Daddy song? Papa was a Rollin' Stone.
歌詞大意: 滾石老爸 四處為家 他死之後 啥也沒留下
沒人關心啊 沒人感謝父親
Nobody gives a fuck. Nobody appreciates Daddy.
母親是很辛苦 我沒說不苦
Now, Mama's got the roughest job. I ain't gonna front.
但人們都感謝母親
But at least people appreciate Mama.
母親每次小小的成功 我們都誇她...
Every time Mama do something right, Mama gets a compliment...
女人就得哄著
cause women need to hear compliments all the time.
女人嘛 要吃要喝要馬屁
Women need food, water, and compliments.
就是這樣
That's right.
還有一雙百搭的鞋
And an occasional pair of shoes.
女人每天都要聽好話 不然會抓狂的
That's right. Women got to hear it all the time, or they lose their minds.
你爸還要催你去誇你媽
And get Daddy to make sure you thank your mama for everything.
"快跟你媽說這菜好吃 跟她說房子好乾淨"
"Tell your mama how good the food is. Tell her how nice the house looks."
"跟她說她髮型很好看"
"Tell your mama how nice her hair looks."
"說了沒? 快去說"
"Did you tell your mama? You better go in there and tell your mama."
是的! "跟媽媽說"
That's right! "Tell your mama."
誰也不誇爸爸
Nobody ever tells Daddy shit.
我是說那些盡職盡責的父親
I'm talking about the real daddies that handle their fucking business.
從來沒人說 "爸 謝謝你付了房租"
Nobody ever says, "Hey, Daddy, thanks for knocking out this rent."
"爸 這熱水澡洗得真舒服"
"Hey, Daddy, I sure love this hot water."
"爸 有了燈 晚上就能看書了"
"Hey, Daddy, this is easy to read with all this light."
沒人關心爸爸
Nobody gives a fuck about Daddy.
我是說那些盡職盡責的父親 沒人關心
I'm talking about a daddy that handles his business. Nobody gives a fuck about Daddy.
想想看父親的職責
Think about everything that the real daddy does:
交房租 付買菜錢 給你一個家
pay the bills, buy the food, put a fucking roof over your head.
是他給了你一切
Everything you could ever ask for.
給你一個更好更安全的環境
Make your world a better, safer place.
父親們有什麼回報呢?
And what does Daddy get for all his work?
大雞排而已 回報就是...
The big piece of chicken. That's all Daddy gets...
一塊大雞排
is the big piece of chicken.
還有些女人連這個都不給
That's right. And some women don't want to give up the big piece of chicken.
"你以為自己是誰啊..."
"Who the fuck is you..."
"把大雞排藏著掖著?"
"to keep the big piece of chicken?'
"你怎麼敢把它藏著!"
"How dare you keep the big piece of chicken!"
你男人累死累活回家 就啃隻雞翅算個蛋啊
A man can't work 12 hours and come home to a wing.
我小時候 要是誰不小心...
When I was a kid, my mama would lose her mind...
把大雞排吃了 我媽會抓狂的
if one of us ate the big piece of chicken by accident.
"艸! 你把那塊雞排給吃了?"
"What the fuck! You ate the big piece of chicken?"
"天吶!"
"Oh, Lord! No, no."
"害得我只好拿點碎雞肉拼一起了"
"Now I got to take some chicken and sew it up and shit."
"給我拿兩個雞翅一塊排骨 反正你爸吃不出來"
"Get me two wings and a pork chop. Daddy'll never know the difference."
絕對不行啊 絕對不行
Just can't do it. Can't do it.
接著說 現在真亂 不過克林頓倒是偷著樂
I don't know, man. The world's nuts. It's all good for Clinton.
只要出亂子了 克林頓就偷著樂
Any time something bad happens, it's good for Bill Clinton.
沒人罵他了嘛
Just gets people off his ass.
"沒人管我 好事 兒童被槍殺 好事"
"Stop thinking about me. Good. Kids got shot. Good."
"沒人想到我"
"Good. People are not thinking about me."
"颶風 好事"
"Tornadoes. Good."
"沒人關注我"
"People ain't thinking about me."
克林頓差點被彈劾了 因為啥?
Clinton damn near got impeached, for what?
因為啥?
For what?
不就偷情不想讓老婆知道嘛
Lied about a blowjob so his wife wouldn't find out.
這也犯法了?
Is that against the law?
這也要最高法院來判?
Do you need the Supreme Court for that one?
人民法院足矣!
You could have took that one to The People's Court!
可以上電視給朱蒂法官判
Could have took that one to Judge Judy.
算上廣告時間 她半小時就幫你判完
She'd have knocked it out in a half hour, plus commercials.
克林頓到底犯什麼錯了?
What the fuck did Clinton do?
他們指控的那些事哪個犯法了
They was charging him with shit I didn't even know was crimes.
"你送她禮了" 送了又怎樣? 他倆是朋友
"You got her some gifts." So what he got her gifts? That's his friend.
朋友間不能送禮物?
You can't buy your friend a gift?
"幫了她找工作" 不能幫朋友找工作?
"Tried to get her a job." You can't get your friend a job?
艸 在場有八成觀眾的工作...
Shit, 80% of the people in this room got their job...
都是朋友推薦才成的
because a friend recommended them.
幫朋友找工作犯法了?
It's against the law to get your friend a job?
我日 她給他吹簫吹了那麼久
Shit, she blew him for a couple of months.
他至少也要給寫封推薦信吧!
The least he could do is give her a recommendation!
也就給得了這點回報
It's the least he could do.
大家...
See, people...
所有人都覺得總統就要特聖潔
everybody expects this holy behavior cause he's the President.
不能被玷污
Expect him to behave this holy way.
他是總統而已 又不是克林頓神父
He's just the President. He ain't Rev. Clinton.
又不是克林頓牧師 又不是克林頓大王
It ain't Pastor Clinton. It ain't Maharajah Clinton.
就只是比爾克林頓 男人嘛 都有七情六慾
It is just Bill Clinton. He's just a man. A man's gonna be a man.
桃花有多缺 就有多忠誠
A man is basically as faithful as his options.
就是這樣 不多不少
That's how faithful a man is, no more, no less.
那些共和黨的大胖子還說
You see all these fat Republican guys going,
"有人給我吹我也不會這樣 這是原則性錯誤"
"I would never do such a thing. This is a travesty."
我心想 "TM有人給你吹嗎"
I'm like, "Nobody's trying to blow you."
哪有20歲的姑娘去給Orrin Hatch吹啊(前參議員)
Ain't no 20-year-old girls trying to blow Orrin Hatch.
哪有人給牛金貴吹啊 (前眾議院發言人 也爆出性醜聞)
Ain't nobody trying to give Newt Gingrich some.
我不管 這輩子你也聽不到牛金貴說
I don't give a fuck, you ain't never gonna hear Newt Gingrich go,
"哎 總有妹子往我身上撲"
"Man, I wish these hoes would back up off me."
"我真希望她們自重點"
"I wish they would just back the fuck up off me."
人生苦短 及時行樂!
Let a player play, shit!
就是這樣
That's right.
要男人拒絕送上門的妹子基本不可能
It's damn near impossible for a man to turn down sex.
這事太難了
It's hard for a man to turn down sex.
hold住自己不是不行 但這也得經過勞動改造
We can stop chasing it, and even that requires some rehab.
拒絕就更別說了
But it's hard for a man to stop.
送上門的 我們躲不及啊
If it chase us, we can't run that fast.
肯定要被推倒的
It's gonna catch us, we're like,
"擦 抽筋了 被推了"
"Shit, pulled a hamstring. You got me."
躲不及啊
You can't run that fast.
女人們很容易就拒絕掉了 你們一點不在乎
See, it's easy for women to turn down sex. It ain't shit for y'all to turn down sex.
都是小菜一碟
It ain't no thing for y'all to turn down sex.
你們總說 "你為毛拒絕不了誘惑? 我天天拒絕啊"
Y'all like, "Why can't you turn it down? I do it all the time."
"說個不 有那麼難? 我天天說" 你們這麼淡然 知道為啥嗎?
"Why can't you say no? I say no." See, it's easy for y'all. You know why?
因為在座的各位女士 從13歲開始...
Cause every woman in here, ever since you were 13...
她們就天天被男人搭訕
every guy you met has been trying to fuck you.
就是這樣 天天有男人獻屌
That's right. Women are offered dick every day.
在座的所有女士...
Every woman in here...
每周至少被獻三次
gets offered dick at least three times a week.
每天三次 艸!
Three times a day, shit!
就是這樣 每次有男人獻慇勤...
That's right, every time a man's being nice to you...
那就是獻屌 就這麼直接
all he's doing is offering dick. That's all it is.
"我幫你拿吧? 來點屌?"
"Can I get that for you? How about some dick?"
"我來幫你吧? 幫你來點屌?"
"Could I help you with that? Could I help you to some dick?"
"你需要屌嗎?"
"Do you need some dick?"
可沒人給男人獻
Nobody offers us shit.
我們只好自己動手
We got to fend for ourselves.
有妹子送上門我們都驚了 "今天哥走狗屎運啊"
We can't believe it when we get an offer. We're like, "Damn, this is my lucky day."
就是這樣
That's right, man.
克林頓性醜聞 很大一部分是希拉裏的錯 (克林頓夫人)
See, this whole Monica Lewinsky scandal, a lot of this shit is Hillary's fault.
我就把話擱這了
That's right, I said it.
擱這了 總要有人說的
I said it. It had to be said. Somebody got to say it.
公眾說 "希拉裏是英雄" 她才不是
Everybody's like, "Hillary's a hero." No, she ain't.
水行俠才是 (漫畫超級英雄)
Aquaman's a hero.
他能跟魚說話 希拉裏有啥技能?
He can talk to the fishes. What the fuck can Hillary do?
很大部分都是希拉裏的錯 因為女人都看得透自己男人
A lot of this shit is Hillary's fault, cause, ladies, you know your man.
比他們自己還看得透
You know your man better than he knows himself.
你知道你男人啥品種
You know what kind of man you got.
要碰到這種"不被吹會死"的男人
You know if you got the crazy, need-a-blowjob-all-the-time man.
你就得親自上陣啊
So sometimes you gotta save your man from himself.
你也知道他慾求不滿了會怎樣
So you know what happens if he don't get his medicine.
希拉裏卻不顧我們好歹
So Hillary Clinton put us all in danger.
是她威脅了社會治安...
She put the security of the free world in jeopardy...
她就得為此付出代價
and she needs to suffer the consequences for her actions.
她是第一夫人啊
That's right, she's the First Lady.
第一夫人就是要第一個去跪舔丈夫的人!
She's supposed to be the first one on her knees to suck his dick!
艸!
Shit!
就是這樣 根本都輪不到萊溫斯基
That's right. Monica Lewinsky shouldn't have even stood a chance.
希拉裏早應該跪在那說 "我hold得住啊"
Hillary's supposed to already be down there like, "Hey, I got it."
"屌這裏我能搞定"
"I've got it. I got the dick."
"你去負責菊花吧"
"Tickle his ass, or something."
"蛋蛋也行 別光站著"
"Yeah, grab a ball, make yourself useful."
克林頓總被盯著
And they always been on Clinton.
沒這事 他也總中槍
Before any of this happened, they was on Clinton.
當年是什麼事?
What was they on him for?
同性戀當兵 大伙都叫喊著"基佬不能進啊"
Gays in the military. Everybody says, "Don't let them in."
想打仗就讓他們打唄 反正我是不去
If they wanna fight, let them fight, cause I ain't fighting.
就算俄國人的坦克開到Flatbush大道 我也不管
I wouldn't give a fuck if I saw a Russian tank rolling down Flatbush Avenue.
我才不上戰場呢 叫我基佬唄
I ain't shooting nobody. So call me a faggot.
戰爭結束後 就我這基佬四肢還健全 感激不盡
When the war is over, I'll be the faggot with two legs, thank you.
知道啥操蛋麼? 大家討厭同性戀
You know what's fucked up? Everybody gets so homophobic.
諸位 早該想開點了...
People, we need to cut that shit out...
誰家沒個同性戀親戚啊
cause everybody in this room got at least a gay cousin.
誰家沒有個表兄弟是基啊
Every last one of you got a gay cousin.
小時候你就看得出來
You knew he was gay when y'all was kids.
你去打球 他在那跳繩
You was playing ball, he was jumping rope.
基是先天的 不是後天的 只不過當時沒找到心愛的男人
He didn't turn gay, he was gay then. He just didn't have nobody to be gay with.
我有個基佬叔叔 我喊他Tom姨
Shit, I got a gay uncle. Call him Aunt Tom.
每年聖誕節 他都帶他男性"朋友"來
Every Christmas, he comes over with his "friend."
歧視是站不住腳的
See, it don't make no sense to hate nobody.
不管是種族歧視 性別歧視 還是別的...
It don't make no sense to be a racist, sexist, or nothing, but... It don't.
站不住腳的
It doesn't.
這就是無理取鬧...
It don't make no sense...
你歧視誰 我祝你家多個誰
cause whoever you hate will end up in your family.
討厭同性戀 我就祝你兒子搞基
That's right, you don't like gays, you're gonna have a gay son.
討厭波多黎各人?
You don't like Puerto Ricans?
我祝你女兒找個這樣的 "瘋狂人生啊!"
Your daughter's gonna come home with "Livin' la vida loca!"
這歌不好聽嗎?
Don't you just love that shit?
這真是神曲啊
That's a catchy-ass song.
聽到就搖擺有沒有 "瘋狂人生啊!"
You just want to jump up on shit. "Livin' la vida loca!
"一起來!"
"Come on!"
多帶感 我一邊開車一邊唱 "瘋狂人生啊!"
I feel that shit. I'll be driving, "Livin' la vida loca!"
我愛死這神曲了
I love that shit.
餘音繞樑 三日不絕啊
That ain't going nowhere. That's gonna be out a long time.
這歌就好像波多黎各的"最炫民族風"!
That shit is like the Puerto Rican Whoomp! (There It Is)!
我剛說到基佬叔叔
I was talking about my gay uncle.
叔叔們是你人生第一課
See, your uncles prepare you for life.
你叔叔要夠多的話 就是人生百態啊...
If you got enough uncles, they'll prepare you for life...
什麼叔叔都有
cause you got every type of uncle.
有基佬叔 酗酒叔
You got your gay uncle, you got your alcoholic uncle.
小偷叔
You got your stealing uncle.
猥瑣叔
You got your molester uncle.
誰都有這麼個猥瑣大叔
Everybody's got that one molester uncle.
你媽問 "孩子們去哪了?"
Your mama's like, "Where them kids at?"
- "Johnny叔帶走了"  - "快搶回來!"
- "They're with Johnny."  - "Get them kids!"
"快 搶回來! 別等Johnny叔對他們下毒手啊!"
"Hurry up, get them kids! Don't leave them with your Uncle Johnny!"
結果你被猥褻之後 你媽還罵你
Later on, you get molested, your mama get mad at you.
"你這是報應"
"That's what you get."
"跑去跟Johnny玩 早警告你了!"
"Hanging around fucking Johnny. I told you about that shit!
"滾去散散心!"
"Now walk it off!"
這就是你家喲
That's your family.
來 咱們回到克林頓上面
I don't know. Let's talk about Clinton.
克林頓唯一一件讓我不爽的事 加稅 稅太高了
One thing Clinton did I didn't like, raise taxes. Taxes all high and shit.
稅有多操蛋?
You know what's fucked-up about taxes?
不是主動去交 是直接被扣啊
You don't even pay taxes. They take tax.
拿到工資 稅錢早沒了
You get your check, money gone.
交稅 不如說被交稅
That ain't a payment, that's a jack.
稅也太多了 市稅州稅社會保障稅
Got all these taxes: city tax, state tax, Social Security tax.
65歲才開始返還福利
You don't get the money until you're 65.
要知道 黑人平均壽命才54啊
Meanwhile, the average black man dies at 54.
艸 29歲就該給我們發社保金了!
Shit, we should get Social Security at 29!
搞毛? 我們活不了那麼久
What the fuck, man? We don't live that long.
亞健康 高血壓 紐約警察 總有一個逮住咱們
Hypertension, high blood pressure, NYPD, something will get you.
警察們搞毛啊? 天吶!
What the fuck is up with the police? My God!
我怕死了 我必須要持槍 去他的
I am scared. I didn't get rid of no guns. Fuck that shit.
某天一個警察把我逼停了 給我嚇得...
And I had a cop pull me over the other day, scared me so bad...
我以為我的車真是偷來的
made me think I stole my own car.
"下車 快TM下車! 這車是你偷的!"
"Get out the car, get out the fucking car! You stole this car!"
我心想 "艸 真的誒"
I'm like, "Damn, maybe I did."
"哦天吶 我偷車了"
"Oh, Lord, I done stole a car."
比稅更操蛋的是什麼? 是保險
You know what's worse than taxes? What's worse than tax is insurance.
總要買點保險
You got to have some insurance.
乾脆別叫保險了 叫"就怕萬一"
They shouldn't even call it insurance. They just should call it "in case shit."
我交了點錢 就怕萬一出事
I give a company some money in case shit happens.
如果不出事 你是不是該把錢退給我?
Now, if shit don't happen, shouldn't I get my money back?
就是這樣 各位 沒有醫療保險 就等死吧
That's right, man, you better have some medical insurance, or you gonna die.
就是這樣 健康飲食適度鍛煉都是屁話
That's right, everybody. You got to eat right and exercise.
只要買保險就行了
No, you don't, you need some coverage.
保險才能救你一命
Coverage will save your life.
人都有一死 但如果你買了保險...
That's right, we all gonna die, but at least if you got some coverage...
你至少能死在床上
you will die on a mattress.
我小時候 家裏沒買保險
That's right. When I was a kid, we didn't have no insurance.
啥也沒有
We didn't have a damn thing.
快死了才能去看醫生
You had to be damn near dead to see the doctor.
要到惠菲寧治不了的地步 (一種止咳藥)
You had to be way past Robitussin.
小時候家裏就只有惠菲寧
That's all we had when I was a kid: Robitussin.
不管你得什麼病 最好惠菲寧有用
No matter what you got, Robitussin better handle it.
- "爸 我哮喘"  - "來勺惠菲寧"
- "Daddy, I got asthma."  - "Robitussin."
- "我癌癥了"  - "來勺惠菲寧"
- "I got cancer."  - "Robitussin."
腿骨折了 我爸把惠菲寧倒在腿上
I broke my leg, Daddy poured Robitussin on it.
"好了兒子 讓它慢慢滲進去"
"Yeah, boy, let that 'tussin get in there.
"好了兒子 等它滲到骨頭裏"
"Yeah, boy, let that 'tussin get on down to the bone.
"這藥能把骨頭捋直了"
"The 'tussin ought to straighten out the bone. It's good.
"惠菲寧要沒了 就往瓶子裏倒點水 搖一搖 又有了"
"If you run out of 'tussin, put some water in the jar, shake it up, more 'tussin.
"滿滿一瓶!"
"More 'tussin!"
你們都愛醫生 他們啥也不用治
Y'all like doctors 'cause they don't cure shit.
屁都治不好
They don't cure nothing.
這麼多年過去了 治不好的病還是治不好
Same diseases been hanging out since I was a kid, man.
最近攻克的病是什麼? 小兒麻痹
What's the last shit a doctor cured? Polio.
小兒麻痹都多久前的事了?
You know how long ago polio was?
那都是爺爺輩的事情了
That's like the first season of Lucy.
艸 那時的我還抱著個破木吉他啊!
Shit, Fred had an Afro with finger waves!
現在還有誰得小兒麻痹的?
Have you ever met anybody with polio?
你見誰小時候麻痹了?
Anybody feel a little 'poly around you?
所以 他們根本就沒治啥
No. That's right, they don't cure shit.
這麼多年 治不好的病依舊治不好
The same diseases been hanging out since I was a kid:
艾滋 鐮狀細胞貧血 肺結核 癌癥 Jerry還在幫殘障兒童
AlDS, sickle cell, tuberculosis, cancer, Jerry's kids still limping around.
我看Jerry Lewis助殘節目...
I've been watching the Jerry Lewis Telethon...
有十五六年了吧
for probably about 15 or 16 years now.
毫無進展
Not one stitch of progress whatsoever.
給點力 騙騙大家也好啊 Jerry!
Come on, man. Lie to me, Jerry!
你幹嘛呢 Jerry?
What the fuck you doing, Jerry?
往背上埋根棍子啊 把他撐起來!
Put a stick in the kid's back, prop him up or some shit!
把Spielberg喊來(阿凡達導演)

Tie some string around him, make a cripple puppet or some shit.
騙大家也好!
Lie to me!
錢都去哪了?
Where the fuck's the money going?
怎麼 都被他拿去染髮了?
What, to keep Jerry's hair black?
錢去哪了? 大家想想
Where's the money going? Think about it.
和他一個年代的音樂家們都離我們而去了
Frank Sinatra: dead. Dean Martin: dead. Sammy Davis: dead.
只有他還一頭黑髮
Jerry Lewis got a full head of black hair.
要是你治不好 就拿錢補償孩子啊!
And if you ain't gonna cure the disease, cut the kids a check!
那個快要死掉的小男孩? 給他來個鋼管舞
That's right, you know the little boy who's getting ready to die? Get him a table dance.
給他來個鋼管舞 老天爺啊! 
Get him a table dance, for Christ's sake!
這種願望可多了去了
I'm sure the Make-A-Wish people hear that request every now and then.
給他來個鋼管舞
Get the boy a table dance.
"你有什麼願望 Jimmy? 你快死了 想見金凱瑞嗎?" (好萊塢喜劇天王)
"What do you want, Jimmy? You're dying. Wanna meet Jim Carrey?"
"不 讓我悶死在大波妹的胸裏吧"
"No, I want some big titties in my face."
"拜託 這可是我的遺願啊"
"It's my last wish, come on."
就是這樣
That's right, man.
現在還有艾滋病 他們能治好艾滋嗎?
That's right, we got AlDS out there. You think they're gonna cure AIDS?
沒戲 連香港腳都治不好
No, they can't even cure athlete's foot.
艾滋肯定治不好 永遠都治不好
They ain't curing AIDS. Shit, they ain't never curing AIDS.
想都別想
Don't even think about that shit.
他們不給你治好 治好了就沒錢拿了
They ain't curing it, cause there ain't no money in the cure.
開藥才有錢 病人複診來 錢財滾滾來
The money's in the medicine. That's how you get paid, on the comeback.
和販毒一個性質 都是賺提成的
That's how a drug dealer makes his money, on the comeback.
政府也是如此
That's all the government is:
政客就一幫販毒的 一屆坑完換一屆再坑
a bunch of motherfucking drug dealers, on the comeback.
艾滋肯定治不好
They ain't curing no AlDS.
說白了就是這樣
That's all it is.
你覺得他們會攻克艾滋?
You think they're gonna cure AIDS?
他們還在氣小兒麻痹沒撈著錢呢!
They're still mad at all the money they lost on polio!
攻克艾滋? 這不是讓凱迪拉克去造能開50年的車嘛
Curing AIDS? Shit, that's like Cadillac making a car that lasts for 50 years.
明知他們做得到...
And you know they can do it...
他們才不做這種傻事呢
but they ain't gonna do nothing that fucking dumb.
他們用在航天飛機上的材料繞著月球...
Shit, they got metal on the space shuttle that can go around the moon...
忍受高達兩萬度的高溫
and withstand temperatures of up to 20,000 degrees.
你TM敢告訴我 他們造不出...
You mean to tell me you don't think they can make an Eldorado...
保險杠不會自己掉的Eldorado車?
where the fucking bumper don't fall off?
明明能造他們不造
They can, but they won't.
對付艾滋也這樣
So what they will do with AIDS is the same thing they do with everything else.
他們會找到一種藥把病緩一緩
They will figure out a way for you to live with it.
治標不治本
They don't cure shit, they just patch it up.
你活得越久 他們榨的錢越多
Get you to the next stop, so they can get more of your money.
絕對不會把病治好的
They ain't gonna cure it.
希望在有生之年 能有這麼一番場景
Hopefully, in our lifetime, you're gonna see somebody go:
"嘿 你昨天怎麼沒上班?"
"Yo, man, you weren't at work yesterday. What's up?"
"我艾滋病犯了"
"My AIDS is acting up.
"唉 這天一變 我這艾滋病又開始折騰了"
"You know, when the weather get like this, my AIDS just pop up."
"但只要弄點惠菲寧 啥都好了!"
"But I took some Robitussin. I'm fine now!"
就是這樣啊親 艾滋病可嚇人了
That's right, man. AIDS is scary, man.
我去查了艾滋病 過了 65分哦
I took my AIDS test, passed it, got 65.
知道這測試哪裏嚇人不?
You know what's scary about the AIDS test?
嚇人嚇在測試結果要等五天才出來
What's scary is you don't get the results back for five days.
五天啊親 這等得
Five days, that's a long time.
知道這五天裏會發生什麼嗎? 你天天反省
And you know what happens in those five days? You start reflecting.
你開始回憶每一次做得不乾不淨...
You start thinking about every nasty, skank-ass...
疑點重重的愛...
questionable piece of sex you ever had...
這還人人都有份
and everybody got a few.
你就 "我擦 我TM怎麼想的啊?"
And you're like, "God, what the fuck was I thinking?"
"1993年 她牙還沒長全啊!"
"1993. She didn't even have teeth!"
"我去啊!"
"Oh, God!"
"我TM怎麼想的?"
"What the fuck was on my mind?"
跟人鬼情未了一樣啊 揮之不去的陰影在眼前飄啊
It's like the movie Scrooge, and the Ghost of Pussy Past comes.
"記得我嗎? 我是逼癢啊 邁阿密跳脫衣舞的"
"Remember me? I'm Itchy, the stripper from Miami."
知道你做了檢測之後還會幹嘛不?
You know what else happens after you take an AIDS test?
你開始給那些人挨個打電話 看看她們還活著不
You start calling up people to see if they're alive.
- 你好 請問Lisa在嗎?  - 我是Lisa
- Hello, can I speak to Lisa?  - This is Lisa.
- 你好 請問Tammy在嗎?  - Tammy去世了
- Hello, can I speak to Tammy?  - Tammy dead.
"發生什麼了?"
"What happened?"
"她被公交車撞了"
"She got hit by a bus."
"謝天謝地! 太棒了!"
"Thank the Lord! Yes!"
"我的小心臟啊!"
"Go Greyhound!"
"太棒了 她被公交車撞死了!"
"Yeah, she got hit by a bus!"
"瘋狂的生活啊!"
"Livin' la vida loca!"
好歹他們還在研究艾滋病 研究怎麼治癒這病
At least they're still working on AIDS. At least they're trying to get rid of AIDS.
有些病呢 人家都放棄了
Some diseases, they just gave up on.
這些病啊 你要得了 你就自求多福吧
There's some diseases, if you get them, you on your own.
媒體也不會來播你...
They ain't gonna have no telethon for you...
沒有R. Kelly給你唱歌搞慈善募捐
R. Kelly ain't singing no song.
就這個病陪著你
You just got this shit, that's right.
你要癱瘓了 沒人屌你了
You get paralyzed, they don't got shit for you.
看看Christopher Reeve(電影"超人"演員) 癱了
Look at Christopher Reeve, paralyzed.
超人不會走路了啊 這TM多叫人心碎啊?
Superman can't walk. What kind of sorry-ass shit is that?
超人坐輪椅 下回是啥? 搞毛啊!
Superman can't walk. What's next? What the fuck!
水行俠盆浴溺水?
Aquaman gonna drown in the tub?
這算哪門子道理?
What the fuck kind of injustice is this?
尼瑪超人不會走路了
Superman can't walk.
綠巨人還得痛風了? 搞毛啊!
The Hulk gonna get the gout? What the fuck!
超人坐輪椅了還
Superman can't walk.
你現在要癱瘓了去看醫生 人家什麼都給不了你
Now you go tell a doctor you paralyzed, they don't got shit for you.
"醫生我癱瘓了 怎麼辦?"
"Doc, I'm paralyzed. What you got?"
"要不你就坐個輪椅在外面轉轉吧?"
"Why don't you take this chair and roll your ass around town?"
"你TM給得出手的就是一輪椅嗎?"
"Is that all the fuck you got is a goddamn chair?"
"我拿著這處方找誰去啊 找賣傢俱的嗎?"
"Where do I take this prescription, to a furniture store, motherfucker?"
"是不是還得去宜家啊? 這TM是搞毛啊?"
"I gotta go to IKEA? What the fuck is this shit?"
"我說我走不了 不是我坐不了!"
"I said I can't walk. I didn't say I can't sit!"
就是這樣 你要是瞎了 你也只能自求多福
That's right. And if you go blind, they don't got shit for you.
看看Stevie Wonder 一瞎40多年...(美歌手 出生不久即失明)
Look at Stevie Wonder, been blind for 40-something years...
賺足了世界上的錢 卻不知道手上是一塊還是一百塊的!
got all the money in the world. Don't know if he got hundreds or ones!
對Stevie來說也就是一摞錢
It's just a stack to Stevie.
他們才不管... Stevie看不見啊
They don't got... Stevie can't see shit.
看不見白天 看不見晚上 看不到陰影 看不到漸變 瞄一眼都不行!
Can't see the day, the night, the shadow, the shade, can't even get a peek!
就瞄一眼啊 能不能幫Stevie瞄一眼啊? 就TM瞄一眼啊!
Just a peek. Can we help Stevie get a peek? Get a fucking peek!
他寫了這麼多滾石雜誌排名前100的唱片
The man wrote Songs in the Key of Life, Talking Book, Innervisions.
能不能幫這哥們兒瞄一眼? 就瞄一下啊!
Can we get this brother a peek? Just a fucking peek!
這要求很高嗎? 就... 就這樣啊
Is that asking for too much? Just a... That's it.
你要跟醫生說你看不見了 他沒轍的
You tell the doctor you're blind, he don't got shit for you.
"醫生 我失明了 怎麼辦呢?"
"Doc, I'm blind. What you got?"
"要不你就牽著這狗 讓它帶著你在城裏轉吧?"
"Why don't you take this dog and have the dog drag your blind ass around town?"
"你就這點貨了 一條破狗? 我說要是我沒瞎 我扇死你丫的!"
"That's all the fuck you got, is a damn dog? Man, if I could see, I would whup your ass!"
"一條破狗! 你這是搞毛?"
"A fucking dog! What the fuck is wrong with you?"
"拜託啊 給我弄個侏儒什麼的啊!"
"Come on, give me a midget or something!"
就是這樣 盲人應該配侏儒
That's right, blind people should get midgets.
所有的盲人都應該配侏儒
All blind people should get midgets.
瞎了過日子已經夠操蛋的了
It's hard enough living life when you're blind.
現在還得學怎麼和狗說話
Now they gotta learn how to talk dog.
這TM算什麼事情? 你又看不見 沒法讀狗的唇語
What kind of shit is that? You can't see, so you can't read the dog's lips.
你只能聽
You just listen.
"啥 我鞋帶沒繫好? 你說什麼?"
"What, my shoelace untied? What?"
"外面有點冷? 啥啊?"
"Is it cold outside? What?"
"門口有人? 草泥馬說什麼啊?"
"Is somebody at the door? What, motherfucker?"
就該給盲人配侏儒
Just give blind people midgets.
而且對一個侏儒來說 找工作本來就老大難了
And if you're a midget, it's already hard enough to get a job.
叫侏儒給盲人指路就是了 做盲人的眼睛
Just have the midget tell the blind man where to go. Be a seeing-eye man.
就走在盲人前面 然後說 "唷 往左拐一個哈"
Just walk in front of the blind man like, "Yo, man, you gotta make a left."
"哥們兒 往左拐哈"
"Just make a left, brother."
到處都是種族主義 誰都不爽 黑人嚷嚷 "種族主義"
Racism everywhere, everybody pissed off. Black people yelling, "Racism."
白人嚷嚷 "黑人種族主義"
White people yelling, "Reverse racism."
中國人嚷嚷 "道路種族主義!"
Chinese people yelling, "Sideways racism!"
印第安人什麼都嚷嚷不出 因為他們都掛了
And the Indians ain't yelling shit 'cause they dead.
誰都逼逼自己過得多苦逼
So everybody bitch about how bad their people got it.
沒人比印第安人過得更苦逼了
Nobody got it worse than the American Indian.
誰TM都給我把嘴閉上
Everybody need to calm the fuck down.
印第安人那個悲劇啊 人品觸底了
Indians got it bad. Indians got it the worst.
知道他們多慘嗎? 你上次同時看到兩個印第安人是啥時候?
You know how bad the Indians got it? When's the last time you met two Indians?
你都沒機會同時看見兩個印第安人了
You ain't never met two Indians.
艸 我這輩子北極熊騎小三輪兒都見過
Shit, I have seen a polar bear ride a fucking tricycle in my lifetime.
就是沒見過有一家子印第安人 在大龍蝦餐廳吃飯
I have never seen an Indian family that's chilling out at Red Lobster.
從沒見過
Never seen it.
誰都在保護環境 尼瑪 樹我天天看得到啊!
Everybody wanna save the environment. Shit, I see trees every fucking day!
就是看不到印第安人
I don't never see no Indians.
今年Macy的年度感恩節大遊行我去了
I went to the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade this year.
他們都湊不夠印第安人來表演啊
They didn't have enough Indians for that shit.
他們雇了一幫清教徒 (專殺原駐民的人)
They had a bunch of Pilgrims.
等到了印第安人上場的時候 出現了三個真的印第安人...
When it came time for the Indians, they had three real Indians...
剩下的都是腦袋上插著羽毛的波多黎哥人
and the rest was a bunch of Puerto Ricans with feathers in their hair.
搞毛啊這! 艸 波多黎哥人我一眼就看得出來
What the fuck! Shit, I know Puerto Ricans when I see them.
別指望有一個能從我眼皮底下溜過去的
You can't slip a Puerto Rican by me.
這不是"風中奇緣" 這是Jennifer Lopez啊!
That's not Pocahontas, that's Jennifer Lopez!
前者為講性感印第安女孩的電影 後者為一靠賣肉的波多黎哥美臀歌手
哪裏都有種族主義 但誰最狂熱? 是白人
Racism everywhere. Who's the maddest people? White people.
沒說你們哈 你們好得很
Not y'all. Y'all all right.
掏了腰包來看我 無可挑剔
You paid money to see me, we cool.
一笑泯恩仇
The feud is over.
你這一看電視 看"60分鐘"(美電視新聞雜誌) 你看白人這氣得啊
No, you watch the TV, watch 60 Minutes. You see white people pissed off, man.
告訴你 白人覺得自己要亡國了
Man, the white man thinks he's losing the country.
看這新聞裏說得: "我們什麼都要沒了 節節敗退啊"
You watch the news: "We're losing everything. We're fucking losing."
"平權法案啊 非法移民啊..."
"Affirmative action, and illegal aliens..."
"這國家都快不是我們的了"
"and we're fucking losing the country."
節節敗退? 去你MD 節節敗退的絕對不是白人
Losing? Shut the fuck up. White people ain't losing shit.
你們要節節敗退了 誰在步步為營?
If y'all losing, who's winning?
反正不是我們黑人
It ain't us.
不是我們黑人啊 你丫有沒有開車出門看過?
It ain't us. Have you driven around this motherfucker?
步步為營的不是黑人啊
It ain't us.
艸 在座的白人 沒有一個肯跟我換的
Shit, there ain't a white man in this room that would change places with me.
一個都沒有 而且我還很有錢哦!
None of you would change places with me. And I'm rich!
做白人就能有這麼好
That's how good it is to be white.
在座某個只有一條腿的 在餐館打雜的白人...
There's a white, one-legged busboy in here right now...
肯定不願變成我
that won't change places with my black ass.
他會說 "謝了哈 我不換 我還是自己摸爬滾打吧"
He's going, "No, man, I don't wanna switch. I wanna ride this white thing out."
"看能混出個什麼結果"
"See where it takes me."
就是這樣啊 如果你是白人 前途遠在天邊
That's right, 'cause when you white, the sky's the limit.
你要是黑人 前途近在眼前!
When you black, the limit's the sky!
就是這樣 現在一說到種族主義...
That's right, man. Now, when it comes to racism...
知道最種族主義的人是誰嗎 誰最極端?
do you know who the most racist people are for real, the real most racist people?
老年黑人
Old black men.
你要看到一個60歲的老黑... 知道你們白人都認識這麼一兩個
You find a brother over 60... I know you white people know an old black man.
你說 "咱單位的Willie 人可好了" 其實他恨你恨得咬牙切齒
You go, "Willie at the job, he's so nice." Willie hates your guts.
找不到比老年黑人更種族主義的人了 知道為啥?
There's nothing more racist than an old black man. You know why?
因為他們是經歷過真正的種族歧視
'Cause an old black man went through some real racism.
他經歷的不是"我沒權利坐出租車"這種
He didn't go through that I-can't-get-a-cab shit.
他就是出租車啊
He was the cab.
一個白人往他背上一跳 就說 "上主道"
A white man just jump on his back, "Main Street."
"左轉 黑鬼!"
"Left, nigger!"
"左轉啊 該死的黑鬼!"
"Left, you fucking nigger!"
你知道那些老黑人牛逼在哪裏嗎?
You know what's wild about the old black men?
一個老黑 見人說人話見鬼說鬼話
An old black man, he ain't gonna let you fuck up his money.
一個老黑無論什麼時候看到白人...
Whenever an old black man sees an old white man...
這熱黑臉肯定在往白屁股上貼
the old black man always kisses the old white man's ass.
"先生 你好嗎? 很高興見到您 能幫您的我都盡力去做"
"How you doing, sir? Pleased to meet you. Whatever I can get you, you let me know."
但這白人要一轉身 他就:
As soon as the white man get out of sight, he's like:
"馬勒戈壁的!"(這種類似YP的，我就這麼翻了啊 捏下 TBD)
"Cracker-ass cracker!"
"我一腳踢爆你個逼樣的 馬勒戈壁的!"
"I'll put my foot in the crack of your ass, cracker-ass cracker!"
"這逼怎麼不給我爆爆粗口呀 馬勒戈壁的!"
"I wish that cracker would've said some shit to me, saltine-assed, motherfucking cracker!"
"舔我菊花去吧 個賤人!"
"Cracker, kiss my ass, you fucking cracker!"
等白人一回來 老黑就 "先生 您好嗎?"
The white man come back. "Howdy, sir?"
我一叔就特瘋狂
I got an uncle real crazy.
我逼叔 55歲了 恨白人入骨 然後娶了個白人老婆
My uncle B., 55 years old, hates the white people, married to a white lady.
他坐那兒張嘴就來 "那幫白人都不得好死 除了Susie"
And he sits around going, "These crackers ain't shit, except for Susie."
有天他想把事情的來龍去脈給我說明白
He tried to explain the whole thing to me one day.
他說 "是 我是娶了個白人做老婆 但我愛她 她愛我 就夠了"
He said, "Yeah, I got a white wife. I love her, she love me. That's all that matters."
"但我跟你說: 哪天黑人要革命了 我上手就把她做了..."
"But I'll tell you this: if the revolution ever come, I'll kill her first..."
"給那幫白人看看老子不是玩玩兒的!"
"just to show these crackers I mean business!"
"馬勒戈壁的! 天殺的 艸!"
"Motherfucker, cracker-ass, motherfucker cracker! Shit, cracker, motherfucker!"
"嘿... 嗨 老婆好"
"Hey... Hi, honey."
"馬勒戈壁的 我把我那逼孩子也做了 艸!"
"Motherfucker cracker. I'll kill my cracker kids, too!"
就是這樣 嗯 黑人...
That's right, man. I don't know, black....
黑人到底需要什麼? 我覺得我們要一個新的領袖
What do we need, y'all? I think we need a new leader.
這多久沒新的黑人領袖了 很久了吧
We ain't had a black leader in a while. In a long time.
能深深打動你的
Somebody that moves you.
你懂的 馬丁·路德·金啦 馬爾科姆·艾克斯啦...(黑人人權運動家)
You know, we had Martin Luther King, Malcolm X...
從此之後 就那幾個代課老師
and ever since then, a bunch of substitute teachers.
從來就沒來過有真傢伙的 我要找個能真正打動我的啊
We ain't had the real thing. I want a motherfucker to move me.
我們能找點誰呢? 我給大家說說啊 有Al Sharpton(黑人牧師 人權運動家)
Who we got? Let me break everybody down. We got Al Sharpton, all right.
這貨還不錯哈 他沒之前兩個那麼犀利...
Al Sharpton's all right. He ain't Malcolm or Martin...
但你要被條子逮了 就找他去吧
but if you get your ass whupped by the cops, he's the guy to call.
當然 Al有點像"Good Times情景喜劇"裏那個賣書的...
Of course, Al kind of looks like Bookman from Good Times...
別以貌取人嘛
but don't let that fuck you up.
咱還能找誰呢? Jesse Jackson (黑人牧師 人權活動家) 他也湊活
Who else we got? Jesse Jackson. Jesse's all right.
他飛過去 人質就放出來了
Jesse went over there, Jesse got them hostages.
我都不知道他怎麼做到的
I don't know how the hell he did that shit.
他過去不帶錢 也不帶好吃的
He went over there with no money, no sweet potato pie.
91年海灣戰爭打響之夜 薩達姆政府綁架著20多英美人士作肉盾
他成功說服薩達姆釋放人質
你猜他TM怎麼說得? 他肯定說:
What the fuck did Jesse say? Jesse must've been, like:
"想叫美國政府真的不爽你嗎?"
"Do you want the United States to really be mad at you?"
"把人質給我就對了"
"Give the hostages to me."
他就這麼說的 咱還有點誰呢? Farrakhan? (伊斯蘭精神運動領袖)
That's what he said, you know. What else we got? Farrakhan?
他一手辦起了百萬黑人大遊行那些
Farrakhan got everybody together for the Million Man March and everything.
但Farrakhan討厭猶太人 這很惡搞
But Farrakhan don't like the Jews, which is bugged.
我一直去Dekalb街上剪頭髮 但我從來沒在一家理髮店裏...
I get my hair cut on Dekalb Avenue. I never been in a barbershop...
聽到一幫黑人在說猶太人
and heard a bunch of brothers talking about Jews.
黑人不恨猶太人 黑人恨的是白人!
Black people don't hate Jews. Black people hate white people!
我們沒心思給你們做分類討論
We don't got time to dice white people up into little groups.
"你們白人我誰都恨! 管你是剛來美國還怎麼樣"
"I hate everybody! I don't care if you just got here."
- 你好啊 我是羅馬尼亞來的  - 你個羅馬尼亞逼樣的!
- Hey, I'm Romanian.  - You Romanian cracker!
我們需要一個領袖啊
We need a fucking leader, man.
我們沒領袖的時候 一旦出了什麼事...
When we got no leaders, when something happens...
我們就小題大作
we make the shit bigger than it is.
不是小事 但別放得太大
It's big, but don't make it bigger than it is.
我看新聞 說"Tupac Shakur被謀殺了"
I'm watching the news, and like, "Tupac Shakur was assassinated."
"Biggie Smalls被暗殺了 被殺手擊倒了"
"Biggie Smalls, assassinated. Struck down by assassin's bullets."
我心裏想 "我去你大爺的!"
I'm like, "No, they wasn't!"
馬丁·路德·金是被暗殺的
Martin Luther King was assassinated.
馬爾科姆·艾克斯是被暗殺的
Malcolm X was assassinated.
JF肯尼迪是被暗殺的
John F. Kennedy was assassinated.
這兩個黑鬼就是被做掉了啊
Them two niggers got shot.
艸 我超愛Tupac 超愛Biggie 但他們生日學校不會停課放假
Shit, I love Tupac, I love Biggie, but school will be open on their birthday.
目測你也不會看見他們的照片...
I don't think you'll see their pictures hanging up...
出現在你奶奶家客廳裏
in your grandmamma's living room.
"這是林肯 馬丁和Tupac"
"That's Abraham, Martin, and Pac."
"這裏呢 上帝和Biggie玩蹺蹺板的模型"
"And right here, I got one of Jesus and Biggie on the seesaw."
"上帝在上端喔"
"Jesus always in the air."
我們需要一個領袖 我覺得哪個人最適合呢?
We need a leader. You know who I think the black leader should be?
- 我覺得誰最合適?  - 誰?
- Who I think the black leader should be?  - Who?
Pat Riley嘛 (現邁阿密熱火隊主席)
Pat Riley.
Riley教練 (曾為NBA球員及教練)
Coach Pat Riley.
再也找不出誰 比他帶領過更多黑人...
No man has led more black men to the promised land...
走向幸福彼岸的了
than Coach Pat Riley.
他倒未必把我們帶上了頂峰 但帶上季後賽妥妥的
He may not get us to the mountaintop, but he'll get us to the playoffs.
這樣就夠了
And that's all we want.
今晚在座有很多女士 我喜歡女人
We got a lot of women here tonight. Love the women.
但知道我最喜歡哪種女人嗎? 又壯又肥的黑妞
You know who my favorite women are? Big, fat, black women.
給我來個359磅的黑妹
Give me a sister about 350 pounds.
她們最棒了 知道為啥?
The best people in the whole world. You know why?
現在這個社會 誰都對自己不滿意
'Cause we live in a society where nobody likes who the fuck they are.
誰都心理抑鬱 亞健康
Everybody's on Prozac, or some shit.
誰都去做整容手術
Everybody's getting cosmetic surgery.
除了又壯又肥的黑妞
Nobody likes who the fuck they are except fat, black women.
她們才不管你怎麼想呢
Fat, black women don't give a fuck what you think.
她週五晚該出去嗨就出去嗨
She's going out on Friday night.
衣服一套 居然還合身
She got an outfit on. That shit match.
高跟鞋一穿 腳背上的肥肉都擠出來
She got the pumps on, and the pump fat coming out the pump.
沒錯 這鞋就像在烘麵包一樣
That's right. It looks like they baking bread in her shoe.
"寶貝兒 你這腳烤好沒? 好了我撒點肉桂上去"
"Baby, your foot ready yet? I'll just sprinkle some cinnamon on it."
對的 一雙黑絲 可憐的襪子都快被擠爆了啊
That's right. She got an anklet on, and that anklet's holding on for dear life.
黑妞才不管 "老娘火辣得很"
Black women don't give a fuck. She's like, "I'm sexy."
"老娘就是性感 沒錯!"
"I am sexy, yes, I am!"
"今晚最性感的就是姐!"
"I am the sexiest motherfucker here tonight!"
"是 我是肚子大 但這堆肉下面藏著好東西!"
"Yeah, I got a gut. There's some good pussy under this gut!"
就是這樣 真羨慕這態度 你也能來句 "瘋狂的生活啊!"
That's right. You want some of this so you can "livin' la vida loca!"
喜歡女人啊 女人女人女人
Love the women, man. Women, women.
你們到底想要什麼?
What the fuck do y'all want?
到底想要什麼? 你們知道自己要幹嘛嗎?
Do you know what you want? Do you know where you're going to?
喜歡你們生活中所面對的一切嗎?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
你知道嗎? 女人TM到底想要什麼?
Do you know? What the fuck do women want?
我知道答案的: 一切
I know what you want: everything.
每個女人都是: "一切" 女人什麼都要
That's every woman's answer: "Everything." Women want every fucking thing.
對女人來說 生活就像是大甩賣一樣
Women act like life was just a big sale, or shit.
"關門前 能拿的我都得拿下"
"I want to get the most shit before things close down."
生活對女人來說就是: 得到一切
That's what fucking life is to a woman: everything.
知道男人想要什麼嗎?
You know what men want?
給吃 給睡 耳根清淨 就這樣
Food, sex, silence. That's it.
吃飽 躺倒 安安靜靜
Food, sex, silence.
"給吃 給操 給我閉嘴!"
"Feed me, fuckme, shut the fuck up!"
咱男人的目標很具體 對吧?
Our goals seem very attainable, don't they?
女人啊 太難弄懂她們了
Women, it's hard to figure women out.
做男人苦啊 我們總覺得錢買得到妹子
It's hard being a guy. We always think we can buy sex.
"我要帶她去那裏 就搞定了 我要給她買這個 就搞定了"
"If I take her here, she'll give me some. If I buy her this, she'll give me some."
屁都買不到我告訴你
Nothing get you nothing.
初次見面 5分鐘內鑒定出屌絲還是高富帥
A woman knows if she's gonna fuck you within the first five minutes of meeting you.
她們一眼看穿
Women know right away.
握手的時候 她們就 "這貨我要了"
They're shaking hands like, "I'm gonna fuck him."
"希望他管好自己的嘴"
"I hope he don't say nothing too stupid."
沒錯啊親 千萬管好自己的嘴...
That's right, fellas, don't say nothing too stupid...
因為女人什麼都看心情來
because women are all about the mood.
如果她一心想著把你上了 把嘴閉上好好享受
If she's in the mood to fuck you, shut up and let it happen.
一旦你說錯什麼 那內褲提上來的速度絕對不慢
'Cause if you say the wrong thing, them panties are coming up mighty fast.
"草泥馬你說毛?"
"What'd you say?"
她跟閨蜜打電話 "是啊 本來想好好跟他滾個床單的..."
She be on the phone with a girlfriend, "Yeah, I was gonna give him some..."
"但這逼開始管不住自己嘴了"
"but he just started talking."
"最TM煩逼逼叨叨的男的了"
"I hate a yakking man, child."
沒錯啊 戀愛關係就是搭上容易 維護難
That's right, man. Relationships: easy to get into, hard to maintain.
為什麼關係就那麼難維護呢? 因為紙包不住火啊
Why are they so hard to maintain? Because it's hard to keep up the lie.
沒人會愛真實的你 你得去忽悠
'Cause you can't get nobody being you. You got to lie to get somebody.
就這長相誰也拿不下 你這動作...
You can't get nobody looking like you look, acting like you act...
你這聲音
sounding like you sound.
兩人初次見面 你見到的根本不是他們真身
When you meet somebody for the first time, you're not meeting them.
見的都是他們的代表
You're meeting their representative.
沒錯 誰是大忽悠 男人還是女人?
That's right. Who are the biggest liars, men or women?
- 男人!  - 女人!
- Men!  - Women!
男人忽悠得最頻繁 但女人忽悠得最厲害
Men lie the most, women tell the biggest lies.
各位 我們一天到晚就是忽悠 一句話兩句謊
Men, we lie all the time. We lie so much, it's damn near a language.
逮到一個男人撒謊...
It's like, to call a man out for lying...
就像逮一個打籃球的智障兒兩運 這麼簡單
is like playing basketball with a retarded kid and calling him for double dribble.
有些事睜一隻眼閉一隻眼
You gotta let some shit slide.
男人嘛 我們一直在忽悠
Men, we lie all the time.
男人一般都忽悠些什麼呢? 一般就是 "我在Tony家"
You know what a man's lie is like? A man's lie is like, "I was at Tony's house."
"我在Kenny家" 男人一般就忽悠這些事情
"I'm at Kenny's house." That's a man's lie.
女人忽悠些什麼呢 "這是你孩子"
A women's lie is like, "It's your baby."
這句咱沒少聽
We've all heard that one.
- 他長得都不像我啊  - 他的帽子和你的很像哦
- It don't even look like me.  - He's got your hat.
沒錯啊 誰是大忽悠? 女人是大忽悠
That's right. Who the biggest liars? Women the biggest liars.
看看你 你們都是
Look at you, all of you.
臭不要臉的騙子 你!
You're a fucking liar. You!
你也是!
You're a liar!
你們都是 都是臭不要臉的騙子!
You're all liars. All of you are fucking liars!
謊言大師啊 迷惑大師
Masters of the lie, the visual lie.
看看你 穿了個高跟鞋 你人有這麼高嗎
Look at you. You got on heels, you ain't that tall.
你化了妝 你臉本來長這樣嗎
You got on makeup, your face don't look like that.
你接了頭髮 你頭髮有這麼長嗎
You got a weave, your hair ain't that long.
你這胸墊得 你咪咪有這麼大嗎
You got a Wonderbra on, your titties ain't that big.
你這沒一樣是真的 還指望我給你說句真話?
Everything about you is a lie, and you expect me to tell the truth?
去你大爺的!
Fuck you!
男人撒謊 我們活在謊言裏啊 所以我們才這麼瘋狂
Men lie, we live lies. That's why we so crazy.
每時每刻 我們都發現自己活在謊言裏
Every now and then, we catch ourselves living a lie.
我們創造了一個謊言的世界
We create a whole lie-world around us.
比如 在座的每個男的 家裏都會藏一些A片
For instance, every man in this room is hiding some porno in his house.
在座所有的男人都有一個A片的秘密藏匿點
Every man in here got a pornography stash in the crib.
沒錯
That's right.
沒到違法那麼多 但絕對夠你爽
Not an illegal amount, just enough to get you by.
謝謝
Thank you.
我們藏A片的時候 那使出渾身解數啊
And when we hide porno, we go all out.
沒人藏冰箱後面 藏床底下
It ain't behind the refrigerator or under the bed.
藏這個的時候我們變身蝙蝠俠了哦
No, we become Batman when it's time to hide some porno.
沒錯 你一拍電燈的開關 整個書架往邊上滑開
That's right, you hit the light switch, the whole bookshelf shifts to the side.
你往下走兩截樓梯 來到你的A片地窖
You go down two flights of stairs into your porno cellar.
Janet Jacme啦 Kobe Tai啦 Jenna Jameson啦 沒錯 
Janet Jacme, Kobe Tai, Jenna Jameson, that's right.
(成人界大神們)
但藏的片總是被女人們發現
But women always find the porno.
但從來不是在藏匿點被發現的 喔不
But they don't find it in the porno hiding place. Oh, no.
女人都是在哪裏找到黃碟的? 影碟機裏
Where do women find the porno at? In the VCR.
所有男的心裏都想 "艸 我怎麼這麼傻逼把碟留在碟機裏了?"
And fellas are like, "Damn, how can I be so dumb to leave it in the VCR?"
我告訴你怎麼回事
I'll tell you why.
因為你那一發出來的時候 你腦子肯定藍屏了
'Cause when you're jerking off, you ain't in your right state of mind.
你這腦子裏啊 一片霧濛濛 告訴你這咋整的
Your brain's all cloudy and foggy. I'll tell you exactly what happened.
某天早上 你老婆早早出門上班去了
One day, your woman left early.
整個家裏 就你一人
You had the whole house to yourself.
你說 "嗯 要不上班之前來一發吧"
So you said, "Let me get a little jerk before work."
所以呢 你在家 把碟放起來 裏面的內容還很正
So you in the house, getting your jerk on. Nice good jerk, too.
你懂的 這種"獨霸一屋"擼
You know, that ain't-nobody-in-the-house jerk.
這擼起來沒得說 不像"隔牆有耳"擼
That's a good jerk. It ain't like that somebody-in-the-next-room jerk.
那擼得不爽 總是"誰?"
That's a bad jerk. That's like, "Who's that?"
隔牆有耳不行
I don't like that jerk.
我說的是擼得給力的 獨霸一屋那種
I'm talking about the good jerk, that nobody-ain't-home jerk.
你把凡士林準備好...
So you get the Vaseline ready...
然後你低頭看著你老二說:
and you just look at your dick and go:
"想叫就盡情叫吧 沒人聽得到"
"Scream if you want to. No one's gonna hear."
然後你們的婚姻就要危機了 沒錯
And right then, your relationship's in trouble. That's right.
因為你們喜歡的東西不一樣 就會出問題
'Cause if you can't share what you're like, you'll have problems.
你愛上某個人的時候 你得愛她的全部
When you love somebody, you got to love everything about them.
邊邊角角的地方你都得喜歡
You got to love the crust of a motherfucker.
吃麵包不能只喜歡中間又白又嫩的地方
You can't just love the white part of the bread.
還有邊 麵包屑 麵包機下每一粒小麵包屑都不能漏了
You gotta love the crust, the crumbs, the tiny crumbs at the bottom of the toaster.
真正的愛情是這樣的
That's what the real motherfucker is.
你喜歡啥 你女人也得喜歡啥 反之亦然...
Whatever you into, your woman gotta be into, too, and vice versa...
不然這日子過不下去
or the shit ain't gonna work.
過不下去噠
It ain't gonna work.
沒錯 你要開始信奉上帝了 你女人最好也開始信教
That's right. If you born-again, your woman gotta be born-again, too.
如果你嗑上藥了 那你女人最好也跟著一起嗑...
If you a crackhead, your woman gotta be a crackhead, too...
不然日子沒法過
or the shit won't work.
日子不可能是你說 "我去教堂了 你呢?" "我去抽兩口!"
You can't be like, "I'm going to church, where you going?" "Hit the pipe!"
這種關係沒前途的
That relationship ain't going nowhere.
兩個嗑藥的能頭頂頭嗑一輩子
Two crackheads can stay together forever.
如果那樣 會發生什麼呢? 對的 開始不滾床單了
That's right, what's gonna happen? They're gonna stop fucking, that's right.
會開始沒話說 沒床單滾
They'll stop talking, stop fucking.
有沒有哪次你和妹子在床上翻雲覆雨 你突然一句話把節操全撒了?
You ever been in bed with your woman, both talking dirty, and you go too far?
有沒有說過什麼話 她直接一腳把你蹬下床了?
You ever say some shit that gets you kicked out of bed?
比如那女的叫 "艸我 用力啊! 快艸我 爹地 打我屁股!"
And the woman's like, "Fuck me, harder! Fuck me, Daddy, spank me!"
- 好的 你個雞  - 你管誰叫雞?
- All right, you ho.  - Who you calling a ho?
"你TM說誰是雞啊?"
"Who the fuck are you calling a ho?"
"把老娘鬆開!"
"Untie me!"
我不是專家啥的 但哥們兒 你要跟你女人說髒兮兮的話...
I ain't no expert or no shit, but, fellas, if you're gonna talk dirty to your woman...
說得時候必須有威信
you got to talk with authority.
你叫你女人做多下流的事都可以
You can get a woman to do any nasty little thing you want.
你只要說得爺們兒一點 一個小眼神...
You say that shit like a man, make a little eye contact...
聲音磁性點 她言聽計從
put a little bass in your voice, she will do that shit.
她非常主動 她急不可耐的
She wants to do that shit. She's dying to do that shit.
你女人比你能想像的要下流幾百倍
Your woman is nastier than you ever imagined.
但你說的時候得把嘴捋順咯...
But you gotta come correct...
如果你吱吱唔唔了 你就玩兒蛋去吧
because anything you mumble ain't getting done.
在床上你不能優柔寡斷啊 說什麼 "抱歉..."
You can't be in bed all unsure, like, "Excuse me..."
"抱歉啊 我在想..."
"Excuse me, I was wondering..."
"女士 我有一個請求 請問你能舔下我的蛋嗎?"
"Ma'am, I have a request. Could you lick my balls?"
"舔你大爺舔 要舔自己低頭舔去!"
"I ain't licking nothing. Lick your own balls!"
所以 如果你說好了 你就搞得定
See, if you just said it right, you'd been in there.
現在你的蛋就干在那裏了
Now you got dry balls.
沒錯 有自信的永遠站上風
That's right, confidence always wins.
知不知道 都1999年了 還有女人不接受口活兒?
Do you realize, it is 1999, some women still don't give head?
尼瑪九九年了啊
Ninety-fucking-nine.
每次我碰上不肯吹的女的...
Whenever I meet a girl that doesn't give head...
我看著她們像看著一盤磁帶一樣 "你這型號的還沒停產啊?"
I look at them like a damn Betamax, "They still make you?"
說到口活兒 就能分出三類女人:
And when it comes to head, there's three types of women:
第一種: 不接受口活兒 拜 走了啊 再見
A: Women that don't give head. Bye, leave, see you.
第二種: 給你吹幾下 好讓你把嘴閉上
B: Women that give you just enough head to shut you up.
有碰到過這種女人的嗎? 她們就這樣 "怎麼樣?"
You ever meet them women? They're like, "You okay?"
我最討厭這種女的!
I hate them women!
第三種 鄙人最愛:
And number three, my favorite woman:
這種女的 舔屌就是她們的最愛
the woman that likes nothing better than to suck a dick.
沒錯 上帝保佑你們!
That's right, God bless all of you!
就是這樣 你們讓世界變得更美好了
That's right, you make the world a better place to live in.
我要你吸我的時候 感覺裏面有解藥一樣!
I want you to suck my dick like you think the antidote's in it!
好像裏面吸得出惠菲寧一樣!
Like you trying to get some Robitussin out of that motherfucker!
沒錯 婚姻啊: 搭上容易 維護難
That's right. Relationships: easy to get into, hard to maintain.
為什麼這麼難維繫? 因為突然有一天 你們都不跟對方說話了
Why are they so hard to maintain? 'Cause at some point you just stop talking.
沒錯 過了段時間誰都不說話了
That's right, everybody stops talking after a while.
你懂的啊 你一回家就開始點頭
You know how it is. You come home and you start nodding.
"嗯 挺好挺好"
"Yeah, we cool."
"我弄點吃的啊"
"I'm gonna get a little something to eat."
為什麼不說話了呢?
Why do you stop talking?
因為到了某一天 那個人說的每一句話你都聽過了...
'Cause at some point, you have heard everything this person has to say...
你TM都聽得反胃了
and it makes you sick to your stomach.
他們說出口之前你就知道了...
You know what they're gonna say before it even comes out their mouth...
你TM就想拿支鉛筆往他們脖子上捅啊!
and you just wanna stab them in the neck with a pencil!
你忍無可忍了!
Your can't take the shit no more!
比如他們說
And they're like,
- 還記得那時候嗎?  - 是 我記得!
- Remember that time?  - Yeah, I remember that time!
- 我有沒有跟你說過...  - 是你跟我說過了!
- I ever tell you about...  - Yeah, you told me about that time!
"別尼瑪跟我反反覆覆講一件事了!"
"Stop telling me the same shit over and over again!"
"能不能來點新鮮的 你出門被綁個架什麼的?"
"Why don't you go out and get kidnapped, have some new shit happen to you?"
沒錯各位 你們得不停說話
That's right. Fellas, you gotta talk.
女人最愛逼逼的就是: "你不跟我說話喏"
That's women's biggest complaint: "You don't talk."
"你得和我說說話呀 我們聊聊吧 你不說話喏"
"You need to talk, let's talk. You don't talk."
沒錯 女人就是喜歡說話
That's right. Women love to talk.
要是奧運會比賽說話 男運動員預選賽都進不了
If they had talking in the Olympics, a man wouldn't stand a chance.
女人喜歡說話 但她們不喜歡跟你說
Women love to talk, but they don't wanna talk to you.
她們喜歡跟自己男人說
They wanna talk to their man.
但她們不是要你說說說
But women don't want you to talk-talk.
她們只要你聽聽聽
Women just want you to listen-listen.
對女人 就是問她一個對的問題...
All a woman really wants you to do is ask her the correct questions...
把她嘴巴開動起來!
that will allow her to run her fucking mouth!
你問一句 她給你說個夠
You set her up, she'll knock them down.
各位 想讓你女人開開心心的嗎?
Fellas, you want your woman to be happy?
你要說的就是 "今天怎麼樣?"
All you got to say is, "How was your day?
"親愛的 今天過得怎麼樣?"
"Honey, how was your day?"
為什麼? 因為一句"今天怎麼樣?" 她就能說上45分鐘
Know why? 'Cause "How was your day?" is a 45-minute conversation to a woman.
作為男的呢 你也不用說什麼 你假裝在說就是了
And as a man, you don't really gotta talk. You gotta just act like you're talking.
"嗯哼 我去 接著說! 不會吧"
"Get out of here. Go on! I don't believe it."
"別騙我! 真的假的? 我勒個去!"
"You don't say! Really? Get out of here!"
"接著說 別嚇我 別胡說? 不可能吧"
"Go on. I don't believe it. You don't say? Get out of here."
"跟你說了那女的有病!"
"I told you that bitch crazy!"
最後這句"跟你說了那女的有病"必須得加上 知道為啥?
You gotta throw in, "I told you that bitch crazy." You know why?
因為每個女的 總有一個她看不順眼的女同事
'Cause every woman's got another woman at her job that she can't stand.
女人們 你們最愛小題大作 事比天大:
Women, y'all exaggerate everything. You turn it into some Dynasty shit, like:
"她這是要毀了我啊!"
"She's trying to destroy me!"
你TM說毛啊? 你丫就一在商店做打包的!
What the fuck are you talking about? You wrap up bags at J.C. Penney's!
她能怎麼樣 把你的紙袋撕了?
What's she doing, ripping up your paper?
哥們兒 多說話 女同胞們 恰恰相反
Fellas, you gotta talk. Women, exact opposite.
你們要學的就是把嘴閉上 沒錯
Y'all gotta learn when not to talk. That's right.
你們有沒有想過 為什麼男人不下班直接回家?
You ever notice how no man comes home straight from work?
沒一個男的下班會直接回家的
No man comes home straight from work.
男人下了班 他得先去哪晃悠一下
A man get off work, he got to go somewhere.
得去喝杯酒 得去抽根煙...
He got to drink something, he got to smoke something...
得去看個球 去見見基友...
he got to watch the game, he got to hang with his boys...
得開開車
he got to take a drive.
他得做點事情 讓自己的腦袋準備好...
He got to do something that will mentally prepare him...
回家聽那些嘮嘮叨叨
for all the talking he gonna hear when he get home.
各位女士 不是你們說的太多
Ladies, it ain't that you talk too much.
只是一進家門 你們就開始辟里啪啦說
You just talk too much as soon as we get in the fucking door.
讓你男人調整一下 不要一股腦全倒出來啊
Let a man get situated. We don't need to hear everything right away.
想想你一個腳剛跨進家門 "說了你別不信..."
Soon as you take one step in, "You're not gonna believe this..."
我先把第二隻腳跨進來行不行!
Let me get my other foot in the fucking door!
我先弄點吃的行不行! 我先弄點喝的行不行!
Let me get something to eat! Let me get something to drink!
我先拉個屎行不行!
Let me take a shit!
你丫去廚房 把我的大雞排拿來行不行!
Go in the fucking kitchen and get me my big piece of chicken!
我完事兒了 謝謝紐約的各位!
I'm out of here. Thank you, New York!
