不是 據我記得 82年您至少還是在私下這樣羞辱我的
No. As I recall, in '82 you were

Maybe because
you were still listening.
那是因為您那時 還能聽得進去
If I'm going deaf, it's because I've had
you screaming in my ear for nine years!
如果是我耳朵聾了 那是因為
過去九年來 您一直對我耳朵大聲嚷嚷

Our boy dropped the ball. That goddamn
glass box is empty for one reason:

免得我失去掌控時 劃破地獄
It's cutting the hell out of my hand.

- (Doug) Like rush hour out here.
- (Kate) Spindler and Nyman.
他們會激動吶喊
They cry on command.
Ah. The Weiderman twins. Don't get too
close. You'll go into sugar shock.
魏德門雙胞胎兄妹 不要靠太近 會被甜蜜電到的

喔 凱兒
(Brian) Well, Kate.
令人驚訝啊 令人驚訝 您好 布萊恩
- Surprise, surprise.
- Hello, Brian.
難怪您一直把他 綁在您身邊
No wonder you've been
keeping him to yourself.
怎麼了 沒什麼
- (Kate) What's the matter?
- Nothing.
不要著急 您會習慣的
Don't worry. You'll get used to it.
好吧

回頭見 剛進來嗎
是的 我以為您在睡覺
- (Hale) Yes.
- I thought you were napping.
我睡不著 不累
I couldn't sleep. I wasn't tired.
God! He has the self control
of a rabbit.
天啊 他可真是自律了
凱兒 您在找什麼 
Kate, what are you looking for?
沒什麼 我的耳環
Nothing. My earring.
我花了四年時間重返全國錦標賽
I spend four years working
my way back to Nationals
那又怎樣 我溜冰的配樂是很另類
and what happens?
I'm skating to weird music
搭檔又不能按 最簡單的指示做
with a partner who can't even follow
the simplest of instructions.
Maybe he's got a problem sleeping.
可能他睡眠有問題
他唯一的問題是 拉鏈拉開得太快
The only problem that he has
is finding his zipper fast enough.
我覺得 您們看起來還不錯呀
I thought they looked good together.
You think this is funny?
We have to skate tonight.
您認為這很可笑嗎 我們今晚必須滑了
現在該休息了 就像您現在一樣 對嗎
- Now is the time to rest.
- Like you, huh?
夠了 說夠了
That's it. That is it.
叫櫃台給您開個間房
Call the front desk
and get a room of your own!
我知道這沒用 我甚至不能集中注意力
I knew this wouldn't work out.
I can't even concentrate.
我甚至找不到 我的幸運耳環了
I can't even find my lucky earring!
在這兒
Hello.
這和溜冰本身無關 對嗎 
This hasn't got anything
to do with skating.
- What does that mean?
- You're falling for him.
您什麼意思 您愛上他了
什麼 道格
- What?
- Doug.
- (laughs) Yes.
- You are. You're falling for him.
是唷 您愛上他了
那真可笑 您真的那樣認為嗎
- That's crazy.
- You think so?
您瘋了 是嗎
- You're nuts.
- Am I?
您看我們在一起是怎樣的 是的 我看到了
- You see how we act together.
- Yes, I do.
我們一直合不來 我的意思是 我們總爭吵
We never get along.
I mean, we're always fighting.
那就是打情罵俏前戲
Foreplay.
好了 我們都到了 您不是在等海爾吧
- OK, we're all in.
- You are not waiting for Hale?
他沒來 他得去波士頓 因為生意上的事
He's not coming. He had to go up
to Boston. Business problems.
您還好嗎 
Is OK with you?
如果您非要擔心什麼 還是擔心一下新手吧
If you wanna worry about something,
worry about ramjet the rookie here.
您說誰
Who?
我們走吧
Let's go.
現在為您帶來的是 全國花式溜冰錦標賽
(woman) So here we are at night number

You look really nervous.
您有多緊張 
How nervous are you?
您有多緊張 
(applause)
(retching)
(Doug continues retching)
我好多了
(whispers) I feel better.
您怎麼了 
What is wrong with you?
我每場比賽前都渾身緊張
I always get tight before a game.
這麼說吧
Put it this way. When I played hockey,
I used to have two helmets.
當我打冰上曲棍球時 我通常 我通常帶兩個頭盔
一個是給比賽時用的 另一個是給比賽前 嘔吐用的
One for the game,
and one forjust before.
現在要吐嗎 
- This just coming up now?
- Bad choice of words.
這建議不錯
(applause)
溜的真漂亮 非常漂亮
Beautiful skating. Just beautiful.
真不敢相信
I don't believe this.
我很好 沒問題
I'm fine. No problem.
不要緊張
(Kate) Don't sweat it.
看著我
- Look at me.
- (man) Miss Moseley, Mr. Dorsey,
莫里斯小姐 杜爾西先生 該您們上場了

深呼吸
Breathe!
不要衝著我呼吸 好嗎 
Just don't breathe on me, OK?
看 好多了
Look, it goes away.
最糟的是
The worst it was, I went out and scored
six goals in the first two periods.
我在球賽前兩節 只進了六個球
接下來上場的是
(announcer) Next to skate,
Kate Moseley, Douglas Dorsey.
凱兒莫斯里 道格杜爾西
- (applause)
- (man) Miss Moseley, Mr. Dorsey,
請上場莫斯里小姐 杜爾西先生
- please.
- You're saying once we get out there
您說我們一旦來到這裡
一切都會很順利是嗎 
everything will be fine?
通常我得花 10分鐘來放鬆
It usually only took me
about ten minutes to relax.
我們的表演 只有兩分半
Our program is two and a half minutes.
所以我們滑完8分鐘之後 我就好了
So eight minutes after
we're done, I'll be fine.
(applause)
接下來上場的是 前全國冠軍凱兒莫斯里
(man) So here they are, former
US champion Kate Moseley
和第一次參加 全國錦標賽的
前冰上曲棍球明星 道格杜爾西
and ex-hockey star Doug Dorsey
at their first Nationals.
這是一個多麼好的 展示您完美的 首場比賽的舞台啊
And what a place to make
your competitive debut.
(engine revving)
(? Yello "The Race")
肩並肩的雙人 阿克塞爾兩週單跳 就是這個動作
(woman) Side by side double axels.
Here they come.
他們完成的很穩定
(man) And they nailed them.
They nailed them just beautifully.
他們穩定漂亮地完成了
這對於美國雙人溜冰選手來說 是怎樣的一個夜晚啊
非常精彩
What a night for US pairs skating.
It's extraordinary.
布萊恩尼門和蘿琳佩可樂思莉 現在排在第一位
Brian Neuman and Lorie Pekurovsky
into first place.
強尼魏德門和茱蒂魏德門 排在第二位
Johnny and Jodie Weiderman skate
safely into the number two spot.
不被看好的 凱兒莫斯里和道格杜爾西 排在第三
And out of nowhere, Kate Moseley
and Doug Dorsey grab the number three.
只有兩對選手 可以獲得代表美國
(woman) Two couples
are all the United States
參加冬季奧運的參賽資格
are allowed to send
to the Olympic Games.
明晚的自由式溜冰 一定會激動人心
Tomorrow night's long program
should be very exciting.
Man, this overnight thing is brutal.
Why can't it be a double-header?
今晚比賽真激烈
為什麼不能來兩場比賽呢 
大會公開賽 自由式溜冰 一下子
Short program, long program, same night.
Boom.
我們一晚上搞定 懂我的意思嗎
- We're out of here. Know what I mean?
- I know what you mean.
我懂您的意思
這就像 已經夠了 這就像
It's like, enough already. It's like...
What's the word?
哪個詞 
您知道我在找哪個詞 
- You know what word I'm looking for?
- I don't know. Expectation?
我不知道 期待 
不是 當您 預期
- No, no. When you, uh...
- Anticipation?
興奮 前戲
- Excitement?
- Foreplay.
前戲 對 就像前戲
- Foreplay?
- Yeah, you know. Like foreplay.
是的 我知道您的意思
Yeah, I know what it means.
您想不想瞭解這是什麼感覺 
Well, wouldn't you rather
just get right to it?
什麼 溜冰
- What?
- Skating. Long program.
自由式溜冰
芝加哥 全國錦標賽
Chicago. Nationals.
鮮花 
Flowers?
睡覺
Sleep. I'd rather sleep.
我寧可去睡覺
- (door shuts)
- Sleep?
睡覺
布萊恩尼門和蘿琳佩可樂思莉
(woman) Brian Neuman
and Lorie Pekurovsky.
滑得很漂亮 這可確定他們獲得 冬奧會參賽資格
Beautiful skating. This assures them
a place on the Olympic team.
剩下一個名額
(man) The remaining spot will go to
one of the two teams left to skate:
將在莫里斯杜爾西組合 和魏德門兄妹組合間產生
Moseley-Dorsey or the Weidermans.
凱兒莫斯里和道格杜爾西
(woman) Kate Moseley and Doug Dorsey.
多麼出色的表演 看看這個蹲轉
What a performance.
Look at that sit spin.
觀眾們知道 他們將見證歷史
This crowd knows it's seeing
history in the making.
我們今晚不會失望了
We're in for a major upset tonight.
(applause)
是的 滑得真好
(woman) Oh, yes. That was great skating.
完成得乾淨 有力度 觀眾非常喜歡
(man) Clean, powerful,
and the crowd just loved it.
太出色了 這些是給我的 
- Fantastic.
- Are those for me?
您很棒
Hey. You were great.
5.4 5.4 5.4
- (announcer) 5.4, 5.4, 5.4...
- (man) These are not great marks.
分數不高 我認為應該更高點
- I expected much higher.
- (woman) Evidently, so did the crowd.
很明顯觀眾也這麼認為
- (booing)
- It's hard to explain,
這很難對外行的觀眾解釋
但有時分數反映出來的 不只是冰上的表現
sometimes scores reflect
more than what's on the ice.
裁判有他們自己的 喜好的選手
The judges have their favorites. And
they don't include Moseley and Dorsey.
顯然這其中不包括 凱兒莫斯里和道格杜爾西
看起來魏德門兄妹 將和尼門&佩可樂思莉 一起獲得
The Weidermans will join Neuman
and Pekurovsky on the Olympic team.
奧運會參賽資格了
(announce continues)
這是胡扯
This is horseshit!
他們在做什麼 我們滑得這麼努力
What crap are they trying to pull?
We skated our asses off out there!
您認為這還是體育運動嗎 
You call this a sport? Bullshit.
真是胡說
(cheering)
(polka plays)
(crowd groans)
太糟了 她做聯合旋轉時失誤了
(woman) Just terrible. She stepped
into the spin, then, I'm not sure,
看上去她好像是 被男伴的牛仔褲絆倒了
but it looked like she got caught
in his lederhosen.
您知道這意味著什麼嗎 
(man) You know what this means.
我們獲得參賽資格了
We are in.
是的 是的 我們要去法國了
Yeah! Yeah! We're going to France!
Parlez-vous Olympics?
(? The Dan Reed Network "Baby Now l")
您確定要這麼做嗎 
- Sure you wanna do this?
- Whatever you're having.
您做什麼我都做
好的 來吧
- All right. We're here.
- (Kate laughing)
哦
(Kate) Oh, boy.
- (Kate laughs)
- OK.
好的
Whoo! Whoa. (laughs)
想跳舞嗎 
You wanna dance?
我不想
- No, I don't think so.
- Aw, Doug. (laughs)
道格
道格 您這個蠢貨
Douglas, you silly thing.
請不要想了
Please don't think. (chuckles)
這就是我喜歡的思考方式 即使我試圖去想 我也做不到
That's what I like about the way I feel.
Even if I tried to think, I couldn't.
我想得太多了 我想得太多了 太累了
And I think too much,
and I think so long. And it's so tiring.
真個世界在旋轉 轉啊 轉啊
The world is spinning
and spinning and spinning.
看
(Doug) Look.
您玩過磁鐵嗎 
Did you ever play with magnets?
您要把它們左右擺在一起
You used to have to push them around
and they'd push away
但它們卻排斥推開 要怎麼讓它們粘在一起
and you push them around the table?
All you really had to do
您要做的就是 把它們翻轉一下 然後突然
was just flip them over, and suddenly...
沒看到嗎 這就是為什麼 所有的事情都這麼驚人
Don't you see? That's why
everything's been so awful.
我需要的 是稍微瘋狂一下
All we needed was a little flip.
凱兒 這樣不好 那海爾怎麼辦 
Kate, it's not right. What about Hale?
哦 海爾搜索中
(Kate) Oh, Hale-shmale. (laughs)
我們結束了
We're through.
我們的婚約取消了
Our engagement is off.
放縱一下
Flip. (laughs)
不要這樣 今晚不行
Come on. Not tonight. Not like this.
不是像這樣
不是像哪樣 
Not like what?
不像我這樣 
Not like me? (laughs)
凱兒 您喝醉了 您什麼意思
- Kate, you're bombed.
- What do you mean? (giggles)
就是說 您該上床睡覺了
That means that it's time
for you to go to bed.
天啊 難道我要的
God, just what I need.
Someone else telling me what to do.
是別人告訴我做什麼
以免您錯過了 我要向您投懷送報
In case you've missed it,
I am throwing myself at you.
我就要脫掉衣服
I am tearing off my clothes
您卻告訴我什麼能做 什麼不能
and you are giving me a rundown
on drinking dos and don'ts.
凱兒 為什麼您不冷靜一下
- Hey. Why don't you calm...
- I get enough coaching on the ice.
我在溜冰時得到的指導 已經夠多了 出去
- Get out.
- You've got this all wrong.
您得到的都是錯的嗎 我有嗎
Do I ever.
請原諒我的吃驚 但是確實令人失望
Excuse my surprise, but really,
what a disappointment.
這是什麼意思 好 看看您自己
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Well, look at you.
有這麼好的天賦 卻肆意揮霍
God's gift to reckless abandon
嚴謹西裝下什麼也不是 只是披著狼皮的羊
revealed as nothing but a prude
in wolf's clothing.
您是個糟糕的醉鬼
You're a lousy drunk.
您是個糟糕的約會對像
And you're a lousy date!
本來不該這樣的
It didn't have to be like this.
我說了 滾出去
I said get out.
(door opens, closes)
(? Delbert McClinton
"I've Got Dreams To Remember")
(knocking on door)
嗨
Hi.
我看過您的比賽
I watched your program.
您的蹲轉很不錯
You've got a great sit spin.
我認為也許我們 可以交換一下秘密
I thought maybe we could trade secrets.
(sighs)
現在開始練習還有點早
It's a little early for practice,
isn't it?
I'm sorry. I must have
the wrong room.
對不起 我一定走錯了房間
向她要些毛巾 可以嗎 
(Doug) Ask her for more towels,
will you?
凱兒
Kate.
凱兒
Kate!
凱兒 能等會嗎 凱兒
Kate, will you wait a minute? Kate.
凱兒
Kate. Kate!
凱兒
凱兒 不要 不要試圖解釋
- Kate.
- Don't. Don't even try it.
看看您都會讓我噁心
Looking at you makes me sick.
想想我是來道歉的
To think I was coming to apologize.
Lorie Pekurovsky.
蘿琳佩可樂思莉
到昨晚之前 您是訂婚了 還是沒訂婚 
Were you or were you not engaged
until last night?
問得好 您把我趕出了房間
- Hardly the point.
- You threw me out of your room.
她也許不需要 等那麼長時間
Count your blessings,
she may not have waited.
不是那麼回事 饒了我吧 不必說細節了
- That's not how it happened.
- Spare me the details.
- Where the hell do you get off?
- Me?
您到底怎麼了 我
這難道是我的錯嗎 
This is my fault? From the first day,
you treated me like a hired hand.
從第一天起 您對我就像是 對待一個工人似的
接著有一天晚上您喝醉了 我就應該感謝我運氣好嗎 
Then one night you get drunk,
I'm supposed to thank my lucky stars?
謝謝 我沒法那麼快適應
I'm sorry. I don't downshift that fast.
讓開 沒問題
- Get out of my way.
- No problem.
我已經練習了一年半了
I've been practicing that move
for a year and a half!
(chuckles)
盲目約會
Blind date.
這麼說我們有點問題了 
這麼說 我們之間有點問題了 
So we have little problem, huh?
很好 我們忽略小問題
Good. We skip little problem,
直接解決主要問題
and go straight line to big problem.
主要問題是什麼 教練 
"And what is big problem, coach?"
妮尤卡和布萊區肯
Smilkov and Brushkin.
誰 
"Who?"
妮尤卡和布萊區肯
Smilkov and Brushkin.
昨晚他們贏得了 歐洲錦標賽的冠軍
Last night they win
European Championship.
分數很高
Perfect scores.
每個人都說 比賽已經結束了
Everybody's been blown away.
Contest is over.
妮尤卡和布萊區肯 是無法被擊敗的
Smilkov and Brushkin are unbeatable.
您們好 蘇聯人
So, hello, Soviet surprise package.
再見吧 金牌
Goodbye, gold medal.
當然 也有個辦法
Of course, there is a possible solution.
但可能太危險了
But... it's probably too dangerous.
這些是從哪來的 
Where did these come from?
20年來 我一直在研究這個
For 20 years,
I've been working on this.
但您知道 有選手 有環境 有願望
But you know, to have skaters,
to have situation,
to have desire, is not ready until now.
這還不夠 直到今天
這是什麼 這是反彈旋轉 接著做一個旋躍嗎
What is this?
Is this a bounce spin into a throw?
(Pamchenko) Mm-hm.
您做不到 關鍵的一點是放鬆
- You can't do that.
- The key to this is release.
中間沒有停頓
- There can be no halfway.
- No. No. It's illegal.
不 不 這是違法的
(laughs, speaks Russian)
Is gray area.
是灰色地區
反彈旋轉接一個旋躍 然後我接住她 
Bounce spin to a throw twist.
Then I catch her?
差不多
Well, sort of.
我們做不了
We can't do this.
Why not? We have all the pieces.
為什麼 我們具備一切條件 
我們只剩五個星期時間
We have five weeks.
潘曲特旋躍
The Pamchenko Twist.
絕對不行 您希望我們以您的名字 命名這個動作嗎
- Absolutely not.
- You expect us to name it after you?
不 不是 這是個錯誤
No, no. Is mistake.
時機不到 這是好事 我能做
- Is not right time.
- This is good stuff. I can do this.
您在說什麼 我不能嗎 只要冰鞋合腳就行
- What are you saying? I can't?
- Hey, if the shoe fits.
Hey, listen. I have been
competing for 13 years
聽著 我參加比賽已經13年了
沒人告訴我 什麼能做什麼不能做
and nobody tells me
what I can or cannot do.
別把你原來的工作給辭了唷
Don't quit your day job.
好 再來一次
OK, again.
Again.
再來
再來 再來
Again, again. Again. Again.
再來 再來
凱兒 頭抬高
Katya, head up.
再高點 再高點 她必須得飛起來
Higher. Higher. She has to fly.
他們會理解嗎 最終會的
- Are they gonna get it?
- Eventually.
在他們幹掉對方之前
Before they kill each other?
放鬆 必須完全放鬆
Release. Release must be total.
Is no halfway. Halfway is bullshit.
不能半途而廢 半途而廢就糟了
您要是中間停下來 您就會受傷
You go halfway, you get hurt.
再高點
Higher. Much higher.
多抬高點
我們需要能量爆發
We are needing an explosion.
(Kate) Oh! Oh!
凱兒 
Kate?
我在看媽媽的照片
I was just looking at
the pictures of Mother.
我現在能聽見她講話
(Jack) I can hear her now:
奧運
"The Olympics."
這一直是她夢想的
It's what she always dreamed of.
看看這個
Look at this thing.
Just sitting here empty.
還是空空的
我們馬上就要實現了
We're almost there, honey.
我能感覺到
- I can taste it.
- What if it stays empty?
如果仍然是兩手空空呢 
Mm. Not this time. Go to bed.
You need your rest.
這次不會
睡吧 您需要休息 我不累
I'm not tired.
凱兒 不
- Kate.
- No. What are we doing?
我們在做什麼 
為什麼我要做這個 
Why am I doing this?
這一直是您想要的
It's what you've always wanted.
一直 
Always?
凱兒 我知道
- Kate...
- I know.
我要走了
I'm going. These little pep talks
can be so exhausting.
這些鼓舞士氣的話令人疲憊
(classical music plays on TV)
(music plays backwards)
冬季奧運會 法國
開幕式您們覺得怎麼樣 
(woman) Opening ceremonies,
you enjoyed yourself?
哦 很好 又冷又精彩
- (Brian) It was great.
- Cold and great.
那麼 道格花式溜冰 和打冰上曲棍球 有什麼區別 
So, Doug, what's the difference
between this and hockey?
女人
- The women.
- (laughter)
那是什麼感覺 每個人只為他們自己
What's the feeling?
Everybody out for themselves
還是有一種團隊精神 
or is there a team spirit building?
我們當然是一個團隊 肯定是
- Oh, we're definitely a team.
- Definitely.
確實有一種團結精神
There's a real sense of togetherness.
精神
- Spirit.
- Spirit.
家庭
Family. It's sort of...
差不多 幾乎是
It's almost...
幾乎是 性高潮
- It's almost...
- Orgasmic.
她說什麼 
(woman) What did she say?
俄羅斯人
- The Russians.
- The Russians.
尼古拉 
(man) Nikolai?
尼古拉 可以拍張照嗎
- (man) Nikolai?
- (woman) Can we get a photo?
您們還會在這待一會嗎
You guys gonna be here a while?
(classical music plays)
(applause)
您忘了扣扣子
You forgot a button.
不是 我喜歡敞著
No, I like it open.
看起來不好
Well, it looks terrible.
扣著勒緊了我的脖子
It pulls at my neck.
您應該在芝加哥錦標賽時 學到教訓的
You should've
mentioned that in Chicago.
(speaks Russian) Enough.
夠了
(announcer speaking French)
(speaking French)
扣上
Button it.
我們要上場了
- We're on.
- (speaks Russian) Good luck.
祝您們好運
接下來出場的是美國隊的
(woman) Representing the United States
of America, Moseley and Dorsey.
莫里斯和杜爾西
扣上該死的扣子 不要管它
- Button the goddamn button.
- Get over it.
您真個不成熟的小混蛋
You are an immature asshole
of the lowest order.
(? Yello "The Race")
如果是在華氏40度
If it was 40 below and that button
meant the difference
這顆紐扣意味著 能活下來
between a long satisfying life
and a horrible death from hypothermia,
或悲慘的凍死
我還是不會扣上 讓您滿意的
I still wouldn't give you
the satisfaction.
滑吧
Skate.
技術上無可挑剔的整套表演
(man) A technically superior program,
但您不覺得少了點什麼嗎 
but did you feel there
was something missing?
絕對是的 他們按規定完成了大會要求的 所有規定動作
(woman) Absolutely. They delivered all
the short program required moves,
但看起來缺乏激情
but it seemed very cold.
好像我們看到的是陌生人 而不是相處已久的搭檔
(man) As if we were seeing two
strangers, rather than a fluid pair.
看起來他們在一起 並不覺得有意思
It just didn't look like
they were having fun out there.
嘿 道格
(woman) Hey, Doug.
高海拔是不是 對今晚的發揮有影響 沒有
- Was the altitude a problem tonight?
- No.
一週來都在聽說 在自由式溜冰中
您們要使用 令人震驚的新動作
Long program. We've been hearing all
week about your new surprise move.
那個動作叫什麼 潘曲特旋躍
- What's it called?
- The Pamchenko.
潘曲特旋躍 這是以誰的名字命名的 
我們不做這個動作
- The Pamchenko. Is it named after?
- We're not doing it.
什麼 我們把它從表演項目中去掉了
- What?
- We've taken it out of the program.
還不成熟
- It's not ready.
- Doug?
道格 
一顆鈕扣
(Pamchenko) A button?
您到底在想什麼 我
- What in hell are you thinking of?
- Me?
對 就是您 您腦子裡到底在想什麼 
Yes, you. What the hell
is in your head?
他這樣說好像是因為我的錯
- He's making like this is my fault.
- You didn't deliver.
您沒扣上呀 什麼 您要我表揚您嗎
What, you want a pat on the back?
我什麼時候變得笨蛋了
When did I become
the designated asshole?
發生了什麼 問您的冰上皇后吧
What happened? Ask the ice queen.
好了 當您完成後 傑克
- That'll be enough of that.
- Let me know when you're done, Jack,
您會告訴我為什麼 我們花了5週練一個
她永遠不會去做的動作
you can tell me why I spent five weeks
on a move she was never gonna do.
您太過分了 我需要贏得金牌
- You're out of line.
- I needed the gold medal!
忘了它吧 沒有那個動作也能贏
Forget it!
We can win without the move.
不可能 這期間您在哪
- (Pamchenko) lmpossible.
- Where were you when this was going on?
我在哪 我在照顧孩子
(Pamchenko) Where was I?
I was babysitting!
告訴您們吧 優雅地輸對我毫無意義
Loud and clear, folks:
Losing gracefully does nothing for me!
也許您將來 可以考慮這個
這就是您在卡爾加里 對布萊恩說的那些話嗎
- Think about that in the future!
- That what you told Brian in Calgary?
您對發生的一切 當作兒戲自欺欺人 我看過錄影帶了
You can kid all you want about
what happened. I've seen the tapes.
那溜冰特技 布萊恩做到了
Brian was getting it done.
Ask him. He'll tell you.
問他吧 他會告訴您的
好了 道格 夠了
All right, Douglas, is enough.
今天是關於一顆扣子
Today, it's about a button.
You people are all excuses.
您們總是有借口 您要別人指責您嗎
- You wanna point a finger...
- You goddamn son of a bitch.
狗娘養的 去找那個真有實力的人啊
Gotta find that go-to guy.
那您們一開始也得有個 真有實力的女選手啊
You should've started
with a go-to girl, Jack.
不要說了 他是對的
- That cuts it!
- He's right.
什麼 
What?
他是對的 他是對的
He's right. He is.
全部
All of it.
我們兩年來努力訓練 但現在我卻放棄了
We worked so hard for two years.
And I just went and threw it all away.
為什麼和我在一起 凱兒 不要
- Why did you stay with me?
- Kate, don't.
不要什麼 
Don't what? Tell the truth?
說出真相 
對今天的表現 我們沒法挽回 
We can't buy back what happened today.
我們不能重新開始 
(Kate) We can't start over.
您認為我看到自己 已經成了什麼
Do you think I look at myself,
at what I've become,
還有我對什麼感到自豪 
and do you think I'm proud?
您想要什麼 
- What do you want?
- I don't know.
我不知道
我想回到開始的時候 聽您對我說
I guess I would like
to go back to the beginning
and have you say, win or lose,
I could just be your daughter.
無論輸贏 我都是您女兒
您每天都來溜冰
You came every day, and you skated.
這件事對您來說 一定是場噩夢
This must've been
like a nightmare for you.
我不知道 會以這種方式結束
I didn't know it was
gonna end up like this.
對不起
I'm sorry.
對所有的一切 我很抱歉
I'm so sorry. For everything.
請原諒
Please excuse me.
我要出去走走
I'm going for a walk.
(maid speaks French)
您這是幹什麼 
Kate. What's this?
我要和我爸爸一起離開 安東有車
I'm going over with my father.
Anton has the other car.
您要走的時候 他會來接您
He'll take you when you're ready to go.
不 我是說行李 我要趕晚上六點半的班機回國
- No, I'm talking about the bags.
- I was gonna catch the 6:30 flight.
今晚 我們比賽結束後 
Tonight? After we skate?
這房子付了兩週房租
The house is paid up for two weeks, so
feel free to stay as long as you like.
您想待多久就待多久 凱兒 等等 您說什麼

If this is about yesterday...
如果這是因為昨天 我要退休了
I'm retiring.
什麼
What?
This afternoon is my final skate.
今天下午的比賽 是我最後一場比賽
凱兒 不要這樣 您會沒事的
- Kate, come on...
- You'll be fine.
您可以很容易再找一個搭檔
You won't have any trouble
finding another partner.
當然 她們也不會像我 耳光打得那麼好
Of course, they won't have
my wonderful slap shot. (laughs)
我要去準備了
I gotta go get ready.

您知道我在想 怎樣才是一件美妙的事 
Do you know what I think
would be wonderful?
如果您們今天 在這些人面前
If you would go out there today
and skate for these people...
滑得像我看到的 您們在訓練中完成的一樣好
...the way I have seen you skate.
感受對方 取悅對方
Enjoy each other.
(speaking Russian)
(applause)

怎麼了 
(Kate) What's the matter?
沒什麼

- Are you all right?
您還好嗎 很好

- (music ends)
- (applause, cheering)
凱兒 我很抱歉
Kate, I'm sorry. My timing,
I know it stinks, but...
我知道這很糟 但是
我一直在想我們的事
I just keep thinking this thing
with us... it's gonna go away.
會過去的
I keep thinking if I can just
keep moving and checking,
我一直在想如果我能 僅僅是做動作並且
我會擺脫這種感覺的 但是
I'll get clear, but...
您明白我對您說什麼嗎 
Do you understand what I'm telling you?
我不想再爭吵了 不 我是說 我不想吵了
- I don't wanna fight anymore.
- No. I mean, yeah, I don't wanna fight.
看 該我們滑了 不能再等了
- Look, we have to skate.
- This won't wait.
凱兒 也許我還沒準備好 也許
Kate, maybe I wasn't ready. Maybe...
也許您沒有給我太多機會 也許
Maybe you didn't give me much
of a chance. Maybe...
我不知道 我就是 就是
I don't know. I just... I just...
(announcer) Nine-six. Nine-three.
(woman speaking French)
凱兒 在這整個過程中的某個時刻 我愛上了您
Kate, somewhere in the middle
of all this, I fell in love with you.
- (woman speaking French)
- You may take the ice.
您們可以上場了
我是說 我愛您 我明確說出了
I'm saying I love you.
I'm saying it out loud.
(announcer speaking French)
(woman speaking French)
不要說我們不合適
Don't say we're not right for each
other. We may not be right for anybody.
因為我們對其他任何人 全都不合適
您們得上場了 您能閉一會嘴嗎 
- (woman) You have to go on.
- Will you shut up a minute!
沒有什麼比在一起要難的了 這可比分開要難
It can't be any harder to stay together
than it was to stay apart.
還剩30秒 能等一分鐘嗎 
- (woman) Thirty seconds.
- (Doug) Will you wait a minute?!
凱兒
Kate... I need you.
我需要您
我需要您
I need you.
我們做潘曲特吧
We're doing the Pamchenko.
- What?
- Oh, you heard me.
什麼 哦 您聽到了
難道妳認為我說愛妳 只是為了表演比賽嗎 
Think I'm doing this
to get a program out of you?
您想贏 不是嗎 
You wanna win, don't you?
不 這不好 凱兒 這太危險了
No. It's no good, Kate.
It's too dangerous.
那我們達成一致了 在表演中加入這個動作

不行 行

不行 行
- Out.

- What difference does it make?
- The difference is...
我現在就想挀作起來
...l'm in the mood
to kick a little ass.
(anthemic instrumental music plays)
(cheering)
(cheering, applause)
您不必這麼做 不 我必須這麼做
- You didn't have to.
- Yes, I did.
