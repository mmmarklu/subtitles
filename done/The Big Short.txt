嗨 弗蘭克 你妻兒最近怎樣啊
Hiya, Frank. How are the wife and kids?
考慮到你的情況 我覺得國庫債券
You know, for you, I'm considering treasury bonds
還有公共事業型股票比較好 抽煙嗎
and utility stocks. Smoke?
在上世紀七十年代末期 銀行業不是那種
In the late '70s, banking wasn't a job
能賺大筆錢的行業
you went into to make large sums of money.
就是特麼每天混日子
It was a fucking snooze.
大都會的比賽打得怎麼樣
How about those Mets?
裏面全是窮鬼 就像保險推銷員或者
Filled with losers. Like selling insurance or
會計員一樣
accounting.
如果銀行業已經夠無聊
And if banking was boring,
那麼銀行的債券部門就完全是讓人昏昏欲睡的存在
then the bond department at the bank was straight-up comatose.
我們都瞭解債券
We all know about bonds.
你把那玩意兒給你十五歲還在流鼻涕的孩子
You give them to your snot-nosed kid when he turns 15.
也許等他到了三十歲 就能賺上一百美元
Maybe when he's 30 he makes a hundred bucks.
無聊透頂
Boring.
這一切當劉易斯·芮乃瑞來到所羅門兄弟公司時
That is, until Lewis Ranieri came on the scene
發生了改變
at Salomon Brothers.
你也許不知道他是誰 但他對你生活造成的影響
You might not know who he is, but he changed your life
比邁克爾·喬丹 iPod以及YouTube加起來還要多
more than Michael Jordan, the iPod and YouTube put together.
好了 先生們 讓我們來賺點錢吧
All right, gentlemen! Let's get some money in here!
我們來賺點錢 怎麼樣
Let's make some money! What do you say?
劉易斯自己當時還不知道
You see, Lewis didn't know it yet,
但他早已用一個簡單的想法
but he had already changed banking forever
永遠地改變了銀行業
with one simple idea.
抵押貸款證券 或者說是私人的抵押貸款證券
The mortgage-backed security. Or private-label MBS.
你有每個人的財產抵押貸款
You've got your average person's mortgage.
固定利率 三十年
Fixed rate, 3O years.
無趣 安全 小額回報 對吧 但是
Boring, safe, small payoff, right? But,
當你把成千上萬的抵押貸款都打包在一起時
when you have thousands of them all bundled together,
馬上利潤就上升了但風險還是很小 因為
suddenly the yield goes up but the risk is still small because,
這些都是抵押貸款啊
well, they're mortgages!
誰不會償還他們的財產抵押貸款呢
And who the hell doesn't pay their mortgage?
這個債券的準確信用等級是多少
What exactly is the credit rating on this bond?
這個債券 先生們 是3A級別的
This bond, gentlemen, is AAA-rated.
這就是密歇根州養老基金
This is exactly what the
一直在尋找的東西
Michigan state pension fund has been looking for.
我要買兩千萬美元的量
I'll buy $20 million.
噢 得了吧 膽子放大一點
Oh, come on, live a little.
那就兩千五百萬
$25 million.
錢財如雨傾注
The money came raining down,
而銀行家們終於第一次
and for the first time,
從鄉村俱樂部轉移到了脫衣舞俱樂部
the banker went from the country club to the strip club.
很快 股票和儲蓄都幾乎變得不值一提
Pretty soon, stocks and savings were almost inconsequential.
-他們一年在財產抵押貸款和十幾種其他類型 -哇哦
- They were doing $50, $100, $200 billion - Whoo!
的債券上斥資五百 一千 甚至兩千億美元
In mortgage bonds and dozens of other securities a year.
美國人們幾乎都沒注意到 他們產值第一的工業
And America barely noticed as its number one industry
變成了無聊老套的銀行業
became boring old banking.
然後三十年後的某一天 2008年
And then one day, almost 30 years later, in 2008,
這一切都崩潰了
it all came crashing down.
三月 貝爾斯登公司瀕臨破產邊緣
March. Bear Stearns was in a death spiral
美聯儲展開援手
and the Fed brokered its sale.
這是
It's been
現代歷史上最嚴重的金融危機
called the worst financial crisis in modern times.
這絕對是這個國家
Certainly the largest
近幾十年來最大的金融災難
financial disaster in decades in this country,
並有可能是美國商業一個時代的終結
and perhaps the end of an era in American business.
最終 劉易斯·芮乃瑞的貸款抵押債券
In the end, Lewis Ranierfs mortgage-backed security
異變成一個畸形的怪物
mutated into a monstrosity that
摧毀了整個世界的經濟
collapsed the whole world economy.
沒有一個專家 領導者或是掌握話語權的人
And none of the experts or leaders or talking heads
意識到了這場災難
had a clue it was coming.
我猜你們大部分人還是不太明白發生了什麼
I'm guessing most of you still don't really know what happened.
是啊 你看到了一小段評述
Yeah, you got a soundbite you
再對別人這麼講 這樣自己就不會聽起來太蠢 但是得了吧
repeat so you don't sound dumb, but come on.
我們的金融機構是非常強悍的
Our financial institutions are strong.
但有些人意識到了即將到來的危機
But there were some who saw it coming.
當整個世界都在享受銀行業帶來的虛假狂歡時
While the whole world was having a big old party,
一小部分局外人和怪人看到了其他人沒能看到的東西
a few outsiders and weirdos saw what no one else could.
這些人裏不包括我 我可不是個怪人 我可酷了
Not me. I'm not a weirdo. I'm pretty fucking cool.
過會兒我們會再見面的
But we'll meet again later.
這些局外人看到了經濟核心裏那個巨大的謊言
These outsiders saw the giant lie at the heart of the economy.
之所以會看到是因為他們做了
And they saw it by doing something
其他蠢蛋們永遠不會去做的事情
the rest of the suckers never thought to do.
他們冷靜旁觀
They looked.
在上世紀三十年代
During the 1930s,
全國的住房市場崩潰了
the housing market collapsed nationwide
差不多百分之八十
by roughly 80%.
我的意思是 有半數的房貸沒辦法償還
I mean, half of all mortgage debt was in default.
而且這些都
And, I mean, there were very
有跡可循 這些跡象都很容易識別
specific identifiers, extremely recognizable.
舉個例子
I mean, for instance,
狂熱現象的一個顯著特徵
one of the hallmarks of mania
就是突然增高的
is the rapid rise
複雜性以及詐騙利率
in complexity and the rates of fraud.
你知道嗎 這些數據居然在上升
And did you know that they're going up?
哇哦
Whoo!
我總是
I've always been
習慣一個人獨處
more comfortable alone.
可能是我玻璃眼的緣故
I believe maybe it's because of my glass eye.
我小時候失去了一隻眼睛
I lost the eye in a childhood illness.
所以我變得不再合群
It separates me from people.
你知道這些數據竟然在
And did you know that they are going
上升嗎
up?
自上世紀三十年代以來最高的詐騙率
The highest fraud rates since the 1930s.
嘿 沒事的 沒事的
Hey, hey, it's okay. It's okay.
不 我不知道
No, I didn't know that.
1933年 經濟大蕭條的第四年
In 1933, the fourth year of the Great Depression.
我們把它洗乾淨然後再裝回去
Let's wash it off and put it back in.
你打得非常好 兒子
You were playing so great, son.
我甚至聽到教練也這麼說
I even heard the coach say it.
我們能趕緊回家嗎
Can we just go home?
大多數社交活動都會讓我和對方感到尷尬
Most social interactions are awkward for me and for the person.
即使是我想恭維對方的時候
Even when I try to compliment someone,
結果也不甚理想
it comes out wrong.
你髮型真好看 是你自己剪的嗎
You have a very nice haircut. Did you do it yourself?
什麼
What?
不 不 我
No. No, I...
很抱歉 我只是
I'm sorry. I'm just...
我總是自己在不停地講啊講
I'm going on and on.
我妻子說我需要更多地去分享
My wife told me I need to share more.
嗯
Mmm.
-這樣感覺更好 -是啊
- That seems healthy. -Yeah.
嗯
Mmm-hmm.
呃
Uh...
所以我能得到這份工作嗎
So do I get the job?
我真的認為我可以幫助你集資
I really think I could help your fund.
好
Yeah.
好 沒問題 繼續
Yeah, sure. Go on.
-你是 -大衛 很好
- You're. .. -David. Great.
我得去給自己找張辦公桌了
I guess I'll go find a desk.
你有什麼需要我現在就為你做的嗎
Is there anything you want me to work on for start...
呃
Uh...
有
Yeah.
你可以過會再告訴我 等會兒我再來
You could let me know later. I could come back.
你不覺得很奇怪嗎
Did you think it was strange when, um,
2001年互聯網泡沫破裂
the tech bubble burst in 2001
但聖何塞 世界科技中心的房產市場
and the housing market in San Jose,
卻在往上升方向發展
the tech capital of the world,
不奇怪嗎
went up?
這不是很奇怪嗎
Wasn't that strange?
不
No.
不 這可是房產 房產總是穩定的
No, it's housing. Housing is always stable.
低風險 很堅固
Low risk. It's solid.
就是這個 對
That's the idea, yeah.
我想要你給我整理
I want you to get me
銷售額排行前二十的房貸證券
the top 20 selling mortgage bonds.
所以你想知道銷售額前二十的房貸證券有哪些嗎
So you want to know what the top 20 selling mortgage bonds are?
不 不 我想要知道每一種證券裏有哪些房貸
No, no, no, I want to know what mortgages are in each one.
好吧 這些房貸不是由
Okay, aren't those mortgages made up of...
等等 這些債券不是由
Wait, aren't those bonds made up
成千上萬的房貸組成的嗎
of thousands and thousands of mortgages'?
是啊
Yeah.
馬上就去辦 巴裏博士
Right away, Dr. Burry.
我一直是個好相處的人
I am a nice guy all daylong.
隨便問誰 和我一起工作都很愉快
Ask anyone, I'm a pleasure to work with.
但只要我兒子搞砸了 我就
But the second my son screws up, I am...
充著他吼 就像我父親對待我那樣
...yelling at him just like my dad did to me.
我聽到那些話語衝出我的嘴巴 而且
I hear the words that are coming out of my mouth and...
抱歉我來晚了 沒出租車了
Sorry I'm late! No cabs.
噢
Oh...
聽我說
So, get this.
我昨天和一個搞零售的銀行家見了面
I met with this retail banker yesterday.
我本應該遊說他來投資一項基金
I'm supposed to be getting him to invest in a fund,
但結果
but instead
我卻開始給他講透支的處罰
I start grilling him about overdraft penalties
他的銀行簽下了十幾張支票
and how his bank will let a customer write 10-12 checks
卻不告訴顧客已經透支了
before they tell them they're overdrawn.
這個混蛋通過這樣
And this creep is making
欺騙玩弄客戶賺了幾十億
billions off screwing over people this way.
然後我越來越生氣
And I'm getting madder and madder.
我問他 我直視著他說
And I ask him, I look him in the face and I say,
你這樣卑鄙地欺詐勞動階級
"How can you sleep at night
晚上是怎麼睡得著覺的
"Knowing that you are ripping off working people?"
你知道他是怎麼回應的嗎 他直接走了
And you know what he did? He left.
他就直接走出了餐廳 什麼話也沒說
He just walks out of the lunch, doesn't say a word.
這他媽是什麼意思
What the fuck is that?
這種情形下算誰搞砸了 是我嗎
Who's fucked up in that scenario? Am I?
還是這個把我晾在一邊的蠢貨
Or is this douchebag, who leaves me hanging?
他是那個搞砸了的人嗎
Is he the fucked up one?
我們已經說過無數次了
We have talked about this numerous times.
你不能遲到之後直接搶別人的話
You can't come in late and hijack the entire session.
你是什麼意思 我沒有搶話啊
What do you mean? I didn't hijack the meeting.
我搶話了嗎
Did I hijack the session?
是的
Yeah.
你是幹什麼的
What do you do?
我在商品行業工作
I'm in commodities.
祝你好運
Good luck with that.
馬克 我知道你剛失去了親人
Mark, I know you suffered a terrible loss.
也許你想要談談這個
Maybe you want to talk about that.
我不想談論那個
I don't talk about that.
等會
Hold on.
等會
Hold on...
該死 我必須接這個電話 抱歉 抱歉
Shit, I have to take this. Sorry. Sorry.
不 我不在乎 波特
No... I don't care, Porter.
這個人的事業都是建立在欺詐人們的基礎之上
This guy's whole business is built on ripping people off.
像他這樣能持續多久呢
How long can that last?
再見 大家
Bye, everybody!
95...
逾期三十天 逾期六十天
That's 30 days late... Sixty days late...
他們及時償還了
They pay on time...
這些FICO評分
These FICO scores...
逾期 及時補上了償還金額
Late. And they caught up on their payments...
又逾期三十天
Another 30 days late...
貸款價值比 95 90 他們及時還清了
LTV, 95... LTV, 90... They caught up on their payments...
逾期六十天 天吶
Sixty days late? Jesus!
貸款價值比 110 我還從沒聽說過
LTV, 110? I've never heard of that!
逾期三十天 比率調整
Thirty days late, rate adjusts...
2007年 比率調整
In '07 rate adjusts...
06年 比率調整
In '06 rate adjusts...
95 90 老天
95... 90... Jesus!
他一整天都沒動過
He hasn't moved all day.
他每隔幾天就會這樣
He does this every few days.
自從他雇了我之後 就沒跟我說過話
He hasn't spoken to me since he hired me.
也許貸款價值比正處在高風險中
Maybe the LTV's at... High-risk,
只有利率 從來沒聽說過這種房貸歷史
interest-only... T never heard of that mortgage history,
我從沒聽說過 怎麼會
I never heard of that... How?
邁克爾 你最近還好嗎 夥計
Michael, how are you, guy?
勞倫斯 我發現了一些非常有趣的東西
Lawrence, I found something really interesting.
太好了 邁克爾 每次你找到有趣的東西
Great, Michael. Whenever you find something interesting,
我們就能賺錢了
we all tend to make money.
你估價了哪支股票
What stock are you valuing?
不 不 不 不是股票
No, no, no, no. No stocks.
我想要做空房產市場
I want to short the housing market.
是嗎 但是房產市場非常堅固
Really? But the housing market is rock solid.
格林斯潘之前剛講過
Greenspan just said
泡沫是區域性的 難以償還貸款的現象很少
bubbles are regional, defaults are rare.
告訴他們 我馬上就到
Tell them I'll be there in a minute.
-再說一遍 -聽著
- Say again? - Look, look...
格林斯潘錯了
Greenspan's wrong.
我知道你不是故意的 但有時你說話聽起來真的
I don't think you mean to do this, but sometimes you sound very
輕蔑又傲慢
dismissive and superior.
這是事實啊 格林斯潘錯了
It's a fact. Greenspan's wrong.
我不知道你還要我說什麼
I don't know how else you want me to say...
聽著 邁克爾
Look, Michael.
四年前 當你還是個只有不起眼的
Metro Capital backed you four years ago
小網站和一些繼承來的錢財的
when you were a doctor with a
博士生的時候 美高給了你支持
dinky webpage and some inheritance money.
我們合作得非常愉快
We've all done very well.
為什麼你不專注於股票呢
Why don't you just stick with stocks?
聽著 你知道的 我 我
Look. You know me. I, I, I...
我尋找一切價值可能存在的地方
I look for value wherever it can be found.
而事實是
And the fact is
這些以房貸為基礎的債券裏全都是些
that these mortgage-backed securities are filled
極其高風險的次級浮動利率貸款
with extremely risky subprime adjustable-rate loans.
等07年時大部分浮動利率
And when the majority of the adjustable rates
開始生效
kick in, in '07,
市場就會衰退
they will begin to fail.
而如果百分之十五的貸款失效 整個債券都將變得毫無價值
And if they fail above 15%, the whole bond is worthless.
邁克爾 你先休息一下
Michael, just take a beat.
我們過會再來談 好嗎
We'll talk about this later, okay?
勞倫斯 拜託 不要對我擺出一副恩人的樣子 聽我說
Lawrence, please, don't patronize me. Listen...
房貸證券
Mortgage-backed securities.
這是
It, it, it...
-次級貸款 -份額
- Subprime loans- Trenches.
讓人搞不懂 對吧
It's pretty confusing, right?
是不是讓你感到無聊 覺得自己就是個傻瓜呢
Does it make you feel bored? Or stupid?
這就是他們的目的
Well, it's supposed to.
華爾街熱衷於使用令人疑惑的詞彙
Wall Street loves to use confusing terms
讓大家覺得有些事只有他們能做
to make you think only they can do what they do.
或者 更好的是
Or, even better,
讓你直接把所有事都交給他們
for you to just leave them the fuck alone.
現在有請泡泡浴裏的瑪格·羅比來解釋一下
So here's Margot Robbie in a bubble bath to explain.
基本上 劉易斯·芮乃瑞的房貸證券
Basically, Lewis Ranieri's mortgage bonds
能給大銀行帶來令人驚奇的利潤
were amazingly profitable for the big banks.
他們通過銷售這些債券時百分之二的
They made billions and billions on their 2% fee
附加費用賺取了成百上千億資金
they got for selling each of these bonds.
但接著他們開始發現沒有足夠的房貸
But then they started running out of mortgages
來組成這些債券
to put in them.
畢竟房屋的數量有限
After all, there are only so many homes
而能夠買得起房子的人也有限 對吧
and so many people with good enough jobs to buy them, right?
所以銀行就開始用風險更大的
So the banks started filling these bonds
房貸來填充這些債券
with riskier and riskier mortgages.
謝謝你 班特
Thank you' Banter.
這樣他們才能不斷得獲取利潤 對吧
That way they can keep that profit machine churning, right?
順便提一句 這些高風險的房貸被稱作次貸
By the way, these risky mortgages are called subprime.
所以不論你什麼時候聽到次貸 把它當作
So whenever you hear "Subprime", think
狗屎就對了
"Shit".
我們的朋友邁克爾·巴裏發現 本應該有百分之六十五的房貸
Our friend Michael Burry found out that these mortgage bonds
都屬於3A信用等級
that were supposedly 65% AAA
實際上大部分都是狗屎
were actually just mostly full of shit.
所以現在他就要做空這些債券
So now he's going to "Short" The bonds.
意思是賭房產市場下跌
Which means to "Bet against".
明白了嗎
Got it?
很好
Good.
現在滾蛋
Now fuck off.
很快就會有其他人發現這個
It's only a matter of time
投資機遇 這只是個時間問題
before someone else sees this investment.
我們必須現在就行動
We have to act now!
你怎麼知道這些債券沒有價值
How do you know the bonds are worthless?
他們不是由成千上萬頁的房貸
Aren't they filled with fucking thousands
組成的嗎
of pages of mortgages?
我看過那些了
I read them.
-你看過那些了 -我看過 是的
- You read them? - I read... Yes.
沒有人會看那些東西
No one reads them. Only
只有把那些玩意兒組合在一起的律師才會去看
the lawyers who put them together read them.
聽著 我不覺得他們真的明白自己做出來的東西
Look, I don't think that they even know what they've made.
這些不良貸款撐起了整個
The housing market is propped up on these
房產市場 所以我
bad loans, and I'm...
這是個定時炸彈 而我要來做空它
It's a time bomb, and I want to short it.
通過什麼途徑呢 邁克爾
Through what instrument, Michael?
做房貸證券沒有任何保險合同和期權
There are no insurance contracts or options for mortgage bonds.
這些債券實在太穩固了
The bonds are too stable.
勞倫斯
Lawrence...
這是我接下來要做的 我要去找一家銀行
This is what I'm gonna do. I am gonna get a bank
讓他們給我做一個
to make me one.
然後
And then
我要把它買下來
I'm gonna buy it.
我不想要做那種類型的生意
I don't want that kind of business.
那種錢不是錢 那是不義之財
Money is not money. That's bad money.
嘿 看著點好嗎
Hey! Excuse me!
我來問問你 有哪家公司會這樣對待自己的客戶
Let me ask you this. What company treats its customers
然後還賺大錢
that shittily and succeeds?
好吧 對 高盛銀行 你說得對
Fine. Okay, Goldman. You're right.
馬克·鮑姆將自己的事業建立在
Mark Baum had built his career
未證實的情況下 絕不假設
on never assuming anyone or any company
任何人或任何公司是合法的
was legit without proving it.
他小時候在猶太學校
When he was a kid he excelled at studying
學習法典學得非常好
the Talmud in Yeshiva. Whatever.
但是某一天他的老師告訴他母親
But one day his rabbi told his mom why.
保羅是個好男孩 馬克把舊約和聖法經傳
Paul is a fine boy, and Mark is an excellent student
也學得非常好
of the Torah and the Talmud.
那麼有什麼問題呢 老師
Then what's the problem, rabbi?
問題出在馬克學習這麼刻苦的原因
It's the reason Mark is studying so hard.
他想在上帝福音中找到矛盾之處
He's looking for inconsistencies in the word of God!
那他找到了嗎
So has he found any?
之後 鮑姆在華爾街籌辦了他自己的基金會
Later, Baum started his own fund on Wall Street.
他對於屁話有驚人的嗅覺
He had an amazing nose for bullshit.
而且他從不懼怕讓大家知道
And he wasn't afraid to let anyone know when and where
何時何地 哪個蠢蛋在說胡話
the bull had gone number two.
但是後來一場悲劇降臨在馬克身上
But then a tragedy happened to Mark,
使他的世界觀轉變成黑暗
and it turned his world view dark
並且讓他相信整個金融系統都只是個謊言
and ready to believe the whole system was a lie.
稍等
Hold on.
辛西婭打電話過來了 我二十分鐘後到辦公室
It's Cynthia. I'll be in the office in 20 minutes.
嗨 親愛的
Hi, honey.
治療師給我打了電話 你又遲到了
The therapist called. You did it again.
沒出租車啊 我又能怎麼辦呢
There were no cabs. What was I supposed to do?
我很擔心你 馬克
I worry about you, Mark.
至少我去了
At least I went.
你四處奔波好像你必須糾正這個世界
You're running around like you have to right
-所有錯誤似的 -好吧
-every wrong in the world. -Okay.
你總是那麼憤怒
You're so angry.
好吧 我就是這樣
Fine. You know what?
我是個刻薄的傢伙 而且我被惹怒了
I'm a mean guy and I'm pissed off.
但是這世界就是個爛攤子 親愛的
But it is a shit storm out here, sweetie.
你根本就不知道人們都是在幹些什麼屁事
You have no idea the kind of crap people are pulling.
每個人走來走去
And everyone's walking
好像覺得自己在完成光榮使命一樣
around like they're in a goddamn Enya video.
他們全都被耍了 你知道嗎
They're all getting screwed, you know.
你知道他們在乎什麼嗎 他們在乎球賽
You know what they care about? They care about the ballgame.
或者他們在乎哪個女演員剛剛進戒毒所了
Or they care about what actress just went into rehab.
我覺得你應該試一下藥物治療
I think you should try medication.
不 不 我們說好了的 藥物會干擾到我的工作
No, no. We agreed. If it interfered with work.
既然你討厭華爾街 也許是時候離開了
You hate Wall Street. Maybe it's time to quit.
-我愛我的工作 -你討厭你的工作
- I love my job. -You hate your job.
我愛我的工作
I love my job.
你太可悲了
You're miserable.
我愛我的工作 我愛我的工作 親愛的
I love my job. I love my job, honey.
馬克
Mark...
對於那天發生的事情 我每天都感到悲傷
I am sad every day about what happened.
我知道你也是一樣的感受 但你從來不表現出來
I know you must feel the same, but you never show it.
我知道你和你的兄弟有多親近
I know how close you were to your brother.
保羅
Paul.
你去哪兒了 保羅
Where'd you go, Paul?
保羅
Paul!
每天我都以為你會和我談談 但你從沒這麼做
Every day I think you're gonna talk about it, but you never do.
你能至少稍微想想做出改變嗎
Will you at least think about the idea of making a change?
好的 親愛的 我會考慮一下的
Fine. Fine. Honey, you know what? I will consider it.
但是 老實講 辛西婭 我很好 真的
But, honestly, Cynthia. I'm okay. I really am.
嘿 嘿 不
Hey, hey, hey! No, no.
我的的士 這是我的的士 這是我的的士
My cab. That's my cab. That's my cab. That is my cab.
蠢貨 去你的 操
Schmuck. Fuck you.  Fuck you.
滾犢子 操
Fuck you. Fuck you.
我過會再給你打電話
I'll call you later.
我想購買房貸證券的掉期交易
I want to buy swaps on mortgage bonds.
一份能夠在底線債券失效時償清
A credit default swap that will pay off
債務的信貸違約掉期
if the underlying bond fails.
你想要賭房產市場下跌
You want to bet against the housing market?
-是的 -為什麼
- Yes. -Why?
這些債券只會在
Those bonds only fail
上百萬美國人不償還房貸時失效
if millions of Americans don't pay their mortgages.
這種事情歷史上從未發生過
That's never happened in history.
請原諒我這樣說 但巴裏博士
If you'll excuse me, Dr.
這似乎是個愚蠢的投資
Burry, it seems like a foolish investment.
基於流行文化中對
Well, based on prevailing sentiment
市場和銀行的主流看法
of the market and banks in popular culture,
是的 這是個愚蠢的投資
yes, it's a foolish investment.
但是 所有人都錯了
But, uh... Everyone's wrong.
這笑話說得好
That's a good one.
這裏是華爾街 巴裏博士
This is Wall Street, Dr. Burry.
如果你給我們免費提供金錢 我們當然會收下
If you offer us free money, we are going to take it.
我唯一的顧慮是債券什麼時候會失效
My one concern is that when the bonds fail,
我想要確認償還金額
uh, I want to be certain, um, of payment
以防你的銀行償付能力出現問題
um, in case of solvency issues with your bank.
不好意思 你是認真的嗎
I'm sorry, are you for real?
你想要反賭整個房產市場
You wanna bet against the housing market
而且你還擔心我們償付不了
and you're worried we won't pay you?
是的 就是這麼回事
Yes, that's correct.
除非市場崩潰
...unless the market crashes.
房產市場永遠不會崩潰
The market on housing's never gonna crash
因為它現在這麼牢固
because it's so solid right now.
我的意思是 誰不會償還他們的房貸呢
I mean, who doesn't pay their mortgages?
恩
Mmm-hmm.
巴裏博士
Dr. Burry,
我們能制定一個現收現付的賠付方案
we could work out a pay-as-we-go structure
在債券失效的時候償付
that would pay out if the bonds fail.
但如果房貸債券的價值上升
But it would also apply to your payments
你就要付錢了
if the value of the mortgage bond goes up.
你每月都必須付給我們附加費用
You'd have to pay us monthly premiums.
這樣你接受嗎 巴裏博士
Is that acceptable, Dr. Burry?
好的
Yes. Yes.
我整理了我想要做空的
Um, I have prospectuses on six
六項房貸債券的資料
mortgage-backed securities I want to short.
這裏大部分房貸
Majority of the mortgages...
我們不會在這個上面損失利益的
I don't see us losing any money on these at all.
巴裏博士 這樣就可以了
Dr. Burry, these should be fine.
是的 我們準備賣給你五百萬
Yeah. We're prepared to sell you $5 million
這些房貸證券的信貸違約掉期
in credit default swaps on these mortgage bonds.
可以賣我一億美元的嗎
Can we make it $100 million?
沒問題 我們可以賣給你一億美元的
Uh, absolutely, we can make it $100 million.
我們會聯繫你 給你寄一些文書之類的
We'll be in touch, send some paperwork over.
嗯
Um...
我喜歡這些杯子
I like these cups.
可以帶一個給我兒子嗎
Can I take one for my son?
好的 好的
Have... Yes. Yes.
謝謝
Thank you.
拿兩個也行
Have two.
可以賣我兩億的嗎
ls there any way to do $200 million?
可以 但是你確定嗎
I mean, we can. But are you sure?
沒問題 我們可以做到
Absolutely. Absolutely, we can do that.
我們有各種服務 我們從事園藝工作
We do different projects. We do gardening.
這些是我想要做空的債券
The bonds I'd like to bet against.
嘗試一下大銀幕的感覺也不壞
It's not bad seeing yourself on the big screen.
這也很酷
It's very cool.
就像我點了份二十四盎司的T骨牛排
I ordered the 24-ounce T-bone, which was choice.
-我要這麼多的 -對
- I went for volume... - Yeah.
而不是頂級的
...rather than prime.
我買了次級 重點是
I went for subprime, and the gist was...
我要生菜 番茄 不要洋蔥
Can I have like, lettuce, tomato, no onions'?
所以 不要洋蔥 要生菜番茄做沙拉 對吧
So, no onions. Lettuce, tomato, Thousand Island okay?
是
Yeah.
嘿 蘭道爾 閣下這是怎麼啦
Hey, Randall! What's with the Dom?
獎金可不夠這樣花三個月哦
Bonuses aren't for three months.
我們剛剛賣了兩億美元的房貸證券違約掉期
We just sold $200 million in credit swaps for mortgage bonds.
給某個加利福利亞的基金經理
Some fund manager from California.
太他媽瘋狂了 對吧
It's fucking crazy, right?
全新的賺錢方式 道格
A whole new way to make money, Doug.
等等 等等 我不知道還有房貸掉期
Wait, wait. I didn't know there were swaps on mortgages.
現在有啦 我們為他專門做了這種掉期
There are now. We made it for him.
他肯定忘了吃藥還是別的怎樣
He must have gone off his Zoloft or something.
我不知道
I don't know.
-想不想加入 不要嗎 -稍等
- Want to join? No? -Just a second.
噢
Oh...
嘿 傑瑞德
Hey, Jared.
你知道蘭道爾剛和某個基金經理
Did you hear about the deal that Randall just did
做的交易嗎
with some fund manager?
蘭道爾 胡扯
Randall? Bullshit.
他就是個蠢貨 肯定是個糟透的交易
He's a foot soldier. I'm sure it's a shit deal.
不 這是真的
No, it's for real.
我說過我們會再見面的
I told you we'd meet later.
沒想到會是在這種我一般不來的地方
Unfortunately, it's in a place like this which I would never be.
下班後我從不跟這些笨蛋出來玩 從不
I never hung out with these idiots after work, ever.
我的朋友都很潮
I had fashion friends.
顯而易見 有人想買2億美元的信用違約掉期
Apparently, this guy wanted $200 million credit default swaps.
蘭德爾做成了這筆買賣 你敢信嗎
Randall made the sale. Can you believe it?
有人敢做空2億美元的房貸債券
Somebody shorted $200 million mortgage bonds?
這還只是在德意志銀行 傳言說他做空了半個城市
That was just with Deutsche. Word is he hit half the town.
總共多少錢
How much in total?
13億美元
$1.3 billion.
什麼 塞恩全部的流動資金也才這個數啊
What? That's pretty much ail of Scion's liquidity.
邁克爾 這真是太瘋狂了
Michael, this is highly distressing.
勞倫斯 這可不是我們
Lawrence, that is not
所有的流動資金
all of our liquidity.
我覺得
And I'm not certain
你並沒真的弄明白這種交易
that you really understand this trade.
這是必賺的錢
This is a certainty.
邁克 我自認為可以算是你的導師
Mike, I consider myself a mentor to you.
但是我們的公司
But our company is not
對投資並不在行 聽懂我的話了嗎
comfortable with this investment. Am I being clear?
勞倫斯 談到投資策略
Lawrence, I have full autonomy
我有充分的自主權
when it comes to investment strategy.
你可以看看我們的協議
You can read our agreement.
別拿成立協議來說事 邁克爾
Do not throw our inception agreement in my face, Michael.
我們達成過共識
We had an underlying understanding
你不能做出過激的舉動
you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man.
這並不瘋狂
This is not crazy.
我帶著腦子思考
It's all very logical.
那麼 現在我們就每月付錢
So, now we pay up premiums on these swaps
就等著房地產市場崩潰嗎
against the housing market until the mortgages fail?
換句話說 放著數百萬不賺
In other words, we lose millions
就為了等一個前所未有的情況出現嗎
until something that's never happened before happens?
沒錯
That's correct.
你好 馬克·鮑姆
Hello, Mark Baum.
嘿 凱西 別怪我
Oh, hey, Kathy, you busted me.
下午我有點私事
I had a personal thing this afternoon.
我可不是你的保姆
I'm not your babysitter.
如果你為摩根士坦利公司賺到了錢 那我就高興
If FrontPoint makes money for Morgan Stanley, I'm happy.
嘿 聽說你懷孕了
Okay. Hey, did I hear you're expecting?
我們只是打算要個小孩
We're expecting to be expecting.
左心室資料有顯示 但我們還是很期待
LVF's are cleaning us out but we're staying positive...
真令人激動
That's exciting!
蛋蛋那裏有個腫塊 我去檢查過
...lump on my ball. And I go in for a scan.
嗯嗯
Mmm-hmm.
結果查出附睪腫了
Turns out that I have a very large thing called an epididymis.
它圍繞著蛋蛋
Which is a thing that goes around the ball
下面就像個口袋
and is like a sac underneath.
我的附睪很明顯
I have an extremely
我知道了
I'm riveted...
我有靈感了 還有更多的描述嗎
I'm riveted by this. Do you have any pictures?
腫的跟睪丸差不多大小
It's almost as large as another testicle unto itself.
看看這個 辛西婭
So get this. Cynthia...
夥計們 辛西婭想要我辭職 在佛蒙特州開家過夜旅館
Guys. Cynthia wants me to quit and open a B&B in Vermont.
這主意不錯
That sounds great. I'd
我很期待你的早餐服務
love to see Mark Baum run a bed and breakfast.
比如 這是您的燕麥粥 混蛋
Like, "Here's your steel-cut oatmeal, asshole."
馬克不樂意去討好
JARED". Mark refused to kiss
那些開支票的客戶
the ring of the people with the checkbooks,
所以他才在摩根士坦利公司的羽翼下創建基金會
so he had to set up his fund under Morgan Stanley's umbrella.
他的小團隊也映射出他對金融系統的質疑態度
His small team reflected his distrust of the system.
你們太壞了 你太壞了
You guys are sick. You're sick.
她說這份工作讓我不開心
She says this job is making me unhappy.
但你不開心的時候 其實很開心
But you're happy when you're unhappy.
我不開心的時候是挺開心的
I am happy when I'm unhappy.
文尼·丹尼爾
Vinnie Daniel.
你知道怎麼做鬆餅嗎
You know how to make a muffin?
-馬克的頭號粉絲 -你知道怎麼洗衣服嗎
- Mark's numbers guy. -Do you even know how
疊被子 鋪床呢 -好吧
-to do laundry? Make a bed? - Okay...
文尼小的時候 在一場惡性犯罪失去了父親
Vinnie lost his father to a violent crime when he was young.
就像馬克一樣 他沒說而已
Just like Mark, he didn't talk about it.
我不想談論此事
I don't talk about that.
辛西婭沒開玩笑 她真的可以讓他去佛蒙特州
Cynthia's no joke. She could actually make him move to Vermont.
她讓我學會了系安全帶
I mean, she made me start wearing a seatbelt.
-嘿 你想讓我 -波特·柯林斯
- Hey, you want me to... - Porter Collins.
布朗大學的前奧林匹克划船手
Former Olympic rower who went to Brown.
在之前一家公司也跟鮑姆一起工作
He worked with Baum at a previous firm
他不懂為什麼沒人肯聽鮑姆的話
and couldn't figure out why no one listened to Baum.
他認為他的想法都很好
The guy with all the good ideas.
抱歉 你打錯了電話
Sorry. I think you have the wrong FrontPoint.
因為同一棟樓裏
'Cause there is another
還有一家對沖基金
FrontPoint in this same building that is bonds.
丹尼·摩西 這群人中的樂天派
And Danny Moses. The optimist of the bunch.
也是交易高手
And a hell of a trader.
這也是大家容忍他嘻哈樂天派的原因
Which is the only reason they put up with his bullshit optimism.
這個電話很奇怪
That was a weird call.
打錯了電話你還聊了這麼長時間
You take longer with a wrong number than anybody else.
打電話的人是德意志銀行的
It was this guy from Deutsche
說什麼做空房貸債券
who was talking about shorting housing bonds.
聊到一半的時候
And then in the middle of the call
我才發覺他找錯了人
I realized he had the wrong FrontPoint.
因為他本來要打給8樓的公司
And then... 'Cause he wanted the one on the 8th floor.
他想做空房貸債券
He wanted to short housing bonds?
是啊 這種幾率就像
Uh-huh. That happens like five times a day
一天接到五次打錯了的電話
that somebody gets the wrong FrontPoint.
-我們該改名了 -等等 等等
- We should change our name. -Wait. Wait.
他想做空住房債券
He wanted to short housing bonds?
打賭房價大跌嗎
Who bets against housing?
資產擔保證券指數多少了
What's the ABX at?
資產擔保證券指數是什麼
What's ABX?
用來追蹤次貸債券價值 快去睡覺吧
It tracks subprime mortgage bond value. Go back to sleep.
資產擔保證券指數在
The ABX is at, uh...
哇 它下降了 從去年起下降了三個點
Wow, it's down! It's down three points since last year.
真奇怪 之前沒聽到一點兒風聲
That's weird. I haven't heard a peep about that.
打電話的人叫什麼
What was this guy's name?
傑瑞德·威內德
Jared Vennett. Vennett.
這就對了 這群幸運的混蛋
That's right. These lucky sons of bitches
從一個打錯了的電話中
caught wind of one of the best trades in Wall Street history
嗅到了華爾街歷史上最好的風聲
from a wrong number.
他們應該給我撥錯的電話抽取10%的提成
They should have paid 10% to my fuckstick assistant.
他叫傑瑞德·威內德 威內德
His name was Jared Vennett. Vennett.
來自德意志交易所的傑瑞德·威內德 聽著就不靠譜
Jared Vennett from Deutsche. Sounded very sketchy.
聽起來像個惡棍
Sounds like a douchebag.
你聞到了嗎
Do you smell that?
你聞到了風中的味道了嗎
Do you smell that?
錢的味道
I smell money.
這是你基本的房貸
This is your basic mortgage...
嗨 你好嗎
Okay, hi. How are you?
請坐
Have a seat.
好了 來自德意志交易所的威內德先生 請指教
Okay, Mr. Vennett from Deutsche Bank. What do we have?
請看資料
There you go.
關於這次分析 你已經告知了多少人
So, how many people have you talked to about this trade?
有一些 肯定有人感興趣
A few. There's definitely some interest.
-不 -我的老闆會揍我的
- No! -My boss would have my ass...
-不 -你瘋了嗎 傑瑞德
- N.O.! -You crazy, Jared?
-滾蛋 -該死
- Get lost. -Fuck you.
這就是你此刻談話的目的 一通打錯了的電話
Which is why you're here talking to us, a wrong number.
聽起來引起了我的注意
Sounds like there's a lot of interest.
是啊 有些人邀請我們加入
All right. A few people have invited us in
為了在這筆交易中嘲笑我 你也打算這樣做嗎
just to laugh at me on this deal. Is that you?
是這樣嗎
Is that what this is?
我們不是這種人
That's not what this is.
只有馬克愛這樣
That's just how Mark is.
-說說你知道了什麼 -我很抱歉
- Let's see what you got. -I'm sorry.
你聞到了嗎 什麼
You smell that? What is that?
什麼 -這兒有什麼味道
What? -What's that smell?
古龍水
Your cologne?
不
No.
機會
Opportunity.
不 錢的味道
No. Money.
-噢 -好吧
- Oh... - Okay.
-我聞到了錢的味道 -好
- I smell money. -Okay.
-克裏斯 請打開 -抱歉
- Chris, God damn it. -Sorry.
這是最基本的房貸證券模型
This is your basic mortgage bond.
對嗎 開始很簡單
All right? The originals were simple.
將成千上萬個3A房貸組合在一起
They were just thousands of AAA mortgages bundled together,
由美國政府擔保
guaranteed by the U.S. Government.
而現代的債券形式完全不同
The modern ones are different.
私有化 而且由分層份額組成
They're private. And they're made up of layers of tranches.
最高層 3A 首先進行償還
The highest level, AAA, is getting paid first.
最底層B最後償還
The lowest rated, B, is getting paid last,
首先斷供
taking on defaults first.
顯而易見 如果你買B 你能賺到更多的錢
Now, obviously, if you're buying B's, you could make more money.
但是有一點風險
But they're a little risky.
有時候也可能償還不了
Sometimes they fail.
克裏斯
Chris?
某處開始 這些B級和2B級
Somewhere along the line, these B's and BB's
從有一點風險到變為狗屎
went from a little risky
垃圾桶在哪
to dog shit. Where's the trash?
在你身後
It's right behind you.
這就是最低信用評分的原理
I'm talking rock-bottom FICO scores.
無收入證實
No income verification.
可調利率貸款 狗屎
Adjustable rates. Dog shit!
違約率已經從1%漲到了4% 夥計們
The default rates are already up from 1% to 4%, fellas.
如果漲到了8% 遲早的事
And if they rise to 8%, and they will,
那麼這些3B公司的房貸也將化為烏有
a lot of these BBB's are going to zero, too.
因此 你離我太近了
And that... You're too close.
這就是機會
...is an opportunity.
行了
Okay.
你覺得達到8%時 這些債券會下跌 而目前我們已經達到4%了嗎
You're saying that at 8% the bonds fail and we are already at 4%?
正是此意
That's right.
如果漲到8% 就世界末日了
If they go to 8%, it's Armageddon?
是的 沒錯
Yeah. That's right.
為何沒人談到這事
How come nobody's talking about this?
你對數據真的確定嗎
You're completely sure of the math?
看看他 他是我的同事
Look at him. That's my quant.
你的什麼
Your what?
我的定量研究員
My quantitative!
我的數學專家 瞧瞧他
My math specialist. Look at him.
你注意到他的不同之處嗎 看看他的臉
You notice anything different about him? Look at his face.
這也太種族歧視了
That's pretty racist.
看看他的眼睛 給你們一個提示
Look at his eyes! I'll give you a hint.
他叫楊
His name's Yang!
他在中國獲得了全國數學競賽
He won a national math competition in China!
他甚至都不會說英語
He doesn't even speak English!
我對數據很肯定
Yeah, I'm sure of the math.
實際上 我叫姜 而且我會說英語
Actually, my name's Jiang and I do speak English.
傑瑞德這麼說是因為
Jared likes to say I don't because he thinks
他認為這會使我看起來更叼一些
it makes me seem more authentic.
我在全國數學競賽中獲得的第二名
And I got second in that national math competition.
所以 你叫我們做空這堆積木嗎 怎麼做空
So you're offering us a chance to short this pile of blocks? How?
通過信用違約掉期
With something called a credit default swap.
就像給債券上保險 如果破產了
It's like insurance on the bond, and if it goes bust
就能拿到10倍的賠償 甚至能拿到20倍的賠償
you can make 10-to-1, even 20-to-1 return.
已經有要破產的勢頭了
And it's already slowly going bust!
10倍 20倍 不可能
10-to-1? 20-to-1? No way.
沒有人注意到了這點
And no one's paying attention.
沒有人注意到了這點
No one is paying attention!
因為銀行在忙著賣債券
Because the banks are too busy getting paid obscene fees
拿提成
to sell these bonds.
等等 你就是銀行家 你為銀行工作
But wait. You are the bank. You work for the bank.
我敢打賭 你的利息一定豐厚
I bet your margins are pretty nice and fat.
不要談我的利息好嗎
Let's not talk about my margins, by the way.
看起來得體 襯衫不錯 有這種男襯衫賣嗎
Being nice and fat, that's a nice shirt. Do they make it for men?
你不是銀行家嗎
Aren't you the bank?
我在銀行工作 但我並不賣身給銀行
I work for the bank. I don't think like a bank.
大銀行 小銀行 我想賺錢 好嗎
Big bank, small bank, I like to make money. All right?
我把話說明白點
Let me put it this way.
好比現在我正站在一座失火大樓前
I'm standing in front of a burning house...
讓你們來買火災保險
And I'm offering you fire insurance on it.
這些債券會如你所說的那麼糟嗎
How can these underlying bonds be as bad as you say?
這並不合法
It wouldn't be legal.
沒有人深究它們中間有什麼
Nobody knows what's in them.
沒有人知道債券中有什麼鬼
Nobody knows what's in the bonds.
我見過65%達到3A級別的
I've seen some that are 65% AAA-rated
事實上95%都是次級狗屎
that I know for a fact are filled with 95%
信用評分低於550
subprime shit with FICOs below 550!
我才不信呢
Get the fuck out of here.
還不夠吃驚嗎
You want me to really blow your mind?
當市場中一個債券風險太高
When the market deems a bond too risky to buy,
你覺得該怎麼做
what do you think we do with it?
想想看
Take a guess.
我不知道 你來說吧
I don't know. You tell me.
好啊 你們覺得就像書上寫的用倉單存貨抵押嗎
All right. You think we just warehouse it on the books? No.
我們會重新打包 跟其他賣不出去的東西
We just repackage it with a bunch of other shit
混在一起組成CDO
that didn't sell and put it into a CDO.
對 這個叫CDO
Yes. A CDO.
-這是什麼 -把一些沒售出去的
- What is that? -This is where we take a bunch of B's,
B、2B、3B級
BB's and BBB's that haven't sold,
我們將它們聚集起來
and we put them in a pile.
當聚集過多時
And when the pile gets large enough,
整體就成了分散化投資了
the whole thing is suddenly considered diversified
評級機構將其評為92%到93%的3A級別
and the whores at the rating agency give it a 92%-93% AAA rating,
然後置之不理
no questions asked.
什麼 再說一遍
Hold it. What? Say that again.
擔保債務憑證
A collateralized debt obligation.
理解CDO非常重要
It's important to understand because it's what allowed
因為它才是讓房地產危機蔓延全國的因素
a housing crisis to become a nationwide economic disaster.
讓我們的世界頂級廚師安東尼·布爾丹來解釋下吧
Here's world-famous chef Anthony Bourdain to explain.
好 比如在一個週末的下午
Okay, I'm a chef on a Sunday afternoon
我在大飯店準備菜單
setting the menu at a big restaurant.
週五我訂了魚
I ordered my fish on Friday,
就如麥克做空的房貸債券
which is the mortgage bond that Michael Burry shorted.
但是有些新鮮的魚並沒賣出
But some of the fresh fish doesn't sell.
我也不知道原因 也許這群比目魚
I don't know why. Maybe it just came out
突然擁有了海豚一樣的智商
halibut has the intelligence of a dolphin.
那麼 接下來我該怎麼做
So, what am I going to do?
把沒賣出去的魚扔掉 就像債券市場的3B評級一樣
Throw all this unsold fish, which is the BBB level of the bond,
自己承擔損失嗎
in the garbage and take the loss?
沒門
No way.
像我這種心靈手巧的主廚
Being the crafty and morally onerous chef that I am,
把賣不出去的債券
whatever crappy levels of the bond I don't sell,
扔進海鮮湯裏去
I throw into a seafood stew.
看 這就不是爛魚 這可是新菜
See, it's not old fish. It's a whole new thing!
最讚的部分莫過於顧客吃著放了三天的比目魚
And the best part is they're eating 3-day-old halibut.
這就是CDO
That is a CDO.
我想知道 這些是如何聚集在一起的呢
I just need to know, how could these possibly be collated?
有時你就像《愛探險的朵拉》
Somehow you're like Dora the Explorer
是你第一個發現
and you're the first person
整件事情 -等等 等等
-who found this thing. -Hold on. Hold on.
那麼房貸債券是狗屎
So mortgage bonds are dog shit,
CDO就是裹在貓屎裏的狗屎
CDOs are dog shit wrapped in cat shit.
對 沒錯
Yeah, that's right.
機構把這些CDO當成
Institutions treat these
像國債一樣的寶貝
CDOs like they're as solid as treasury bonds,
而它們將要一文不值
and they're going to zero.
不 這不可能 去年就售出了5000億美元
No. That can't be right. There were $500 billion
的住房債券
in housing bonds sold last year alone.
信用評級機構 銀行 政府
The rating agencies, the banks, the fucking government,
你的意思是他們在閉著眼睛開車
you're saying they're all asleep at the wheel?
對 我的整個部門都對這種狗屎在流口水
Yeah. My whole department's long on this stuff.
他們還叫我膽小鬼 叫我泡沫男孩
They call me Chicken Little. They call me Bubble Boy.
A級沒了 B級沒了
A's, zero. B's, zero.
2B級沒了 3B級沒了
BB's, zero. BBB's, zero.
接下來它就是崩潰
And then that happens.
它是指什麼
What is that?
就是美國的房產市場
That's America's housing market.
謝謝
Thank you.
說得真特麼好 傑瑞德
Fuckin' A, Jared.
閉上你的嘴
Shut your fucking mouth.
-跟你一起逛逛 -好的
-...hang out with you. - Good. Okay.
賺錢要緊 接下這筆單 我們做朋友吧
Sack up, do the deal. Let's be friends.
我們拭目以待 謝謝
We will see. Thank you.
別想糊弄我 那當然
Don't bullshit me. All right.
你是打算拒絕 對嗎
You're gonna say no, aren't you?
不不 我只是在評估
No. No, I'm just evaluating right now.
謝謝 多謝你的到來
Thank you. Thank you for coming in.
拜 傑瑞德
Bye, Jared.
這不對勁
I don't like it.
他在耍我們
He's playing us.
他在耍我們 他在這場遊戲里陷得太深了
He's playing us. He's got too much skin in the game
他在找人墊背
and he's dumping his position.
如果他說的是對的呢
What if he's right?
你覺得他說得對
You want him to be right.
是啊 沒錯
Yes, I do.
銀行給我們25%的信用卡利息
The banks have given us 25% interest rates on credit cards.
他們在助學貸款上騙了我們
They have screwed us on student loans
我們再也沒辦法脫身了
that we can never get out from under.
然後這傢伙走進我的辦公室
Then this guy walks into my office and says
聲稱這些銀行很貪婪 已經蒙蔽了市場的真相
those same banks got greedy, they lost track of the market,
而我能從他們的愚蠢中賺取利潤
and I can profit off of their stupidity?
操 我希望他說的是對的
Fuck, yeah, I want him to be right!
你為什麼不討厭這傢伙呢
How come you don't hate this guy?
你教導我們不要相信的特徵 他身上到處都能體現
He's everything you taught us not to trust.
我不討厭他 他把自身利益擺到桌面上來
I can't hate him. He is so transparent
我恰恰很尊重他
in his self-interest that I kind of respect him.
我會從他手中買輛車嗎 不會
Would I buy a car from him? No.
關於房貸市場的看法 他說的對嗎
Is he right about the mortgage market?
-不 -快去調查 快去調查
- No. -Let's find out. Let's find out
瞧 只是兩個簡單的問題
Look. It's two very simple questions.
房地產泡沫存在嗎
Is there a housing bubble?
如果存在 銀行瞭解多少
And if there is, how exposed are the banks?
是 好的
Yeah. Okay.
咱們快點行動起來
Let's get on this quickly too.
如果他說的對
Because if he's right,
那麼手頭有個幾百萬的破產者
every loser with a couple million
就會來找我們的麻煩
bucks and a fund is gonna be jumping on this.
走吧
Let's go.
就在那個早上
Just that morning...
摩根大通 摩根大通
JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase.
好了 別再說"摩根大通"了
Okay. Stop saying "JPMorgan Chase".
我這次感覺不錯
I got a good feeling about this.
這只是個會面而已
It's just a meeting though, you know?
只是個會面 就像
It's just a meeting. It's something like...
人們時時刻刻都有會面
People have meetings all the time. You know?
喝咖啡時 人們會碰面
People drink their coffee, they have a meeting.
棕地基金 我們在這
Brownfield Fund?  Yes!
-嘿 你好 -泰德
- Hey. Hello. - Ted.
克裏斯 我是泰德的前台
Chris. I'm on Ted's desk.
克裏斯
Chris. Okay.
-我叫查理 查理·蓋勒 -查理
- I'm Charlie, Charlie Geller. -Charlie.
-傑米·西普裏 你好 -傑米
- Jamie Shipley. Hi. -Jamie.
我們非常想跟你們的交易平台合作
We're so excited to get set up on your trading platform.
酷
Cool.
請坐吧
Here, have a seat a second.
好的
All right.
泰德讓我為會面做了一些準備
So, I... Ted had asked me to do some meeting prep.
但我沒找到關於你們的市場材料
But I couldn't find any marketing material on you guys.
我們剛從博爾德搬來
We just moved here from Boulder.
-好的 -沒錯
- Yeah. -Got it.
能看看你們的招募書嗎
Could we see some of your offering documents?
棕地基金是用我們的錢經營的
Well, Brownfield is its own money.
-我們自己的錢 -好的
-It's our money. -Yeah.
能說說你們的資金規模嗎
Can you tell us how much you manage?
當然 我們現在做到三千萬美金了
Of course. We're doing $30 million right now.
但在四年前
Um, but we started
我們起始資金僅僅十一萬 -哇
-four years ago with $110,000. - Wow.
如你所見 我們的投資回報相當可觀
So, as you can see, that's pretty phenomenal returns.
我們想跟摩根簽訂ISDA協議
We want to get an ISDA agreement with JPMorgan so we can
這樣我們可以進行長期期權合作了
deal in long-term options.
-確實很棒 -是啊
- That's really cool. -Yeah.
這點子真酷
That is so cool.
謝謝
Thank you.
但是你們沒有達到ISDA的資本金投入額
But you guys are under the capital requirements for an ISDA.
差多少
By how much?
大概
Uh...
差了十四億七千萬
One billion four hundred seventy million, so...
差了不少
...A lot.
真令人尷尬 對吧
This makes us look bad, doesn't it,
我們連資本金投入額都不清楚
that we didn't know what the capital requirements were?
呃
Uh...
是有點不太好
It's not great.
但是
But, uh.
保持這樣的利潤率
Keep up those returns and give us a call
以後會有機會給我們打電話的
way down the line. You know.
好嗎
Okay?
-好的 謝謝你 克裏斯
- Okay. -Thanks, Chris.
祝你們好運
Have a good one, guys.
謝謝你 克裏斯
Thank you, Chris.
該死
Shit!
誰會在下午四點五十
Who the fuck schedules a meeting
安排會議 -我的天
at 4:50 in the afternoon? -Oh, my, God.
真悲哀
That was so painful.
夥計 美國銀行和貝爾斯登沒回我們的電話
Dude, B of A and Bear didn't even return our calls.
就連該死的美聯銀行
And even fucking Wachovia
也不正眼瞧我們 -我知道
-blew us off, man! -I know.
這些是其他一樣沒通過的人
Here's the prospectuses of all the other losers
留在大堂的招股書
who didn't make it past the lobby.
我真不太想搞這個了
I don't think I can do this anymore. You know.
我還年輕 還能幹一番大事
I'm young, yet. I can still do something with my life.
我很想念科羅拉多州 連煙草味都更香
I miss Colorado anyway. The weed's better.
先生們 請離開大廳
Gentlemen, I need you to leave.
好 我們馬上走 走吧
Yep, yep, we're going. Let's go,
看看這個 看看這個
Look at this. Look at this.
這傢伙
This QUY
說房地產市場就是一個巨大的泡沫
says that the housing market's a giant bubble.
這部分情節並非十分精確
Okay, so this part isn't totally accurate, you know.
我們不是在被拒的大廳裏
We didn't find Jared Vennett's housing bubble pitch
發現了傑瑞德的房地產泡沫文章
in the lobby of a bank that rejected us.
事實是
The truth is, um,
一個朋友告訴了查理這件事 然後我
a friend had told Charlie about it, and I read about it
在格朗特的利率觀察者中讀到的
in Grant's Interest Rate Observer.
這太瘋狂了
This is crazy.
這事太瘋狂了
This is crazy stuff.
該死 這裏寫著
Shit, he's saying that there's 10-to-1 returns
房貸證券的信用違約掉期是10倍的收益
on credit default swaps for mortgage-backed securities?
整個房地產市場即將崩潰
And the whole housing market is about to collapse?
對傑米和查理來說 房地產市場的末日預言
For Jamie and Charlie, the housing market
對他們來說正是契機
doomsday prediction was music to their ears.
他們在傑米家的車庫創業起家
They had started working out of Jamie's garage
傑米在東海岸做帆船生意
with $110,000 Jamie had saved
存了十一萬美元
taking sailboats up and down the East Coast.
我們的投資策略很簡單
Our investment strategy was simple.
人們不願意設想不好的事情
People hate to think about bad things happening,
所以人們常常低估風險率
so they always underestimate their likelihood.
他們的策略很簡單 很聰明
Their strategy was simple and brilliant.
他說的對
What he said.
傑米和查理發現市場上對於人們覺得永遠不會發生的事情
Jamie and Charlie found markets will sell options very cheaply
常常傾向於低價售賣期權
on things they think will never happen.
這樣一來 就算犯了錯誤 損失也不大
So when they were wrong, they were wrong small,
但是假如他們投對了 那就能大賺一筆
but when they were right, they were right big.
幾年內他們就用十一萬美元賺了三千萬
Within a few years they had turned $110,000 into $30 million.
但是接下來他們要去紐約了
But then it was time to go to New York City.
到目前為止 情況不是很樂觀
And so far, it wasn't going very well.
這得要它看上去有前景 否則的話
So what if it does seem interesting. No...
沒有銀行願意給我們ISDA協議的 我們真是一籌莫展
No bank will give us our ISDA. We're dead in the water.
這種交易簡直是天方夜譚
These kind of trades are totally out of the question.
我們得給本打電話
We got to call Ben.
我們給本打電話吧
Let's call Ben!
本·裏克特以前在新加坡做交易員
Ben Rickert was a former trader in Singapore
後來因為厭倦了這個行業而退出
for Chase who quit the whole game in disgust.
在科羅拉多的時候他剛好是傑米的鄰居
He happened to be Jamie's neighbor when they were in Colorado
他們是遛狗的時候認識的
and they met walking dogs.
但是本是個很消極的人
But Ben was dark.
他不光覺得金融系統會崩潰
He didn't just think the whole system would fail.
他甚至覺得整個世界都會逐漸崩潰
He thought the whole world was going down.
這些蔬菜都是我從花園裏新摘的
Every one of these vegetables is fresh from my garden.
你們也應該弄一個花園
You guys should start your own garden.
你們需要弄一些沒有農藥化肥的天然土壤
What you got to do is get your soil off the petrochemicals.
恩
Hmm.
我用草木灰和尿給土施肥
I used wood ash and urine to help restore the soil.
它們反應會生成大量的硝酸銨
It creates ammonium nitrate.
種子將會成為新一代貨幣
Seeds are gonna be the new currency.
不是孟山都公司搞出來的那些轉基因種子
And not those Franken-seeds from Monsanto.
我說的是真正的綠色無污染有機種子
I'm talking about good, healthy, organic seeds.
說真的 弄個花園吧
Make yourself a garden.
-靠山吃山 靠水吃水 -你真是瘋了
- Learn to live off the land. -You're a fucking lunatic.
本有在大銀行工作的經驗
Ben had real experience in a big bank.
傑米和查理
Jamie and Charlie had
可連曼哈頓大銀行的廁所都沒進去過
never even been in a Manhattan bank bathroom.
但是本已經告別銀行業了
But Ben was done with the banking world.
他很肯定
He was very clear.
好吧 我們先合計合計
All right, let's crunch some numbers
之後再談給本打電話的事情
and then maybe we'll talk about calling Ben.
我們總是在合計來合計去
We're always crunching numbers.
為什麼從來都沒得到什麼結果呢
When haven't we crunched the numbers?
那我們就再多合計一點
We're gonna crunch the numbers like harder...
你們得趕緊走人
I need you out of here.
好的 稍等
Of course. One second.
好的女士 馬上
Yes, ma'am. We're going.
天哪 我真是煩死了 這簡直就是浪費時間
Oh, God. I hate this. This is a total waste of time.
別這樣 放鬆一下難道不好嗎
Oh, come on. Would you relax?
鎮外四十五分鐘車程的地方有一處房地產開發
There's a housing development 45 minutes outside town.
馬克想讓我們先去那裏看看
Mark wants us to check that out first.
好吧 希望路上能經過古巴餐廳
Well, I hope there are some Cuban restaurants on the way there.
我聽說邁阿密的古巴餐廳好吃極了
Because I heard the Cuban food is amazing in Miami.
看在我這麼痛苦的份上 別在我面前嬉皮笑臉的成嗎
Please don't be chipper in the face of me being miserable.
我看著都煩
It really makes me hate you.
我只是想吃東西而已 哪有嬉皮笑臉
How is wanting to eat good food being chipper?
喂
Hello?
喂
Hello?
這是要賣給誰啊
What do these go for?
一棟房子竟然42.5萬美元
$425,000 each?
什麼事啊 夥計
What's up, man? What do you want?
你好 我在走訪
Hello. I'm surveying
拖欠房貸90天以上的客戶
mortgage owners who are over 90 days delinquent.
我在找一個叫哈維·哈普瑟的人
I'm looking for a Harvey Humpsey.
你在找我房東的狗嗎
You want my landlord's dog?
你房東填貸款單的時候
Your landlord filled out his mortgage application
用的是他狗的名字嗎
using his dog's name?
我猜是這樣
I guess so.
等會 那個混蛋從來沒有還過房貸嗎
Wait, has that asshole not been paying his mortgage?
我可是一直在交房租啊
'Cause I've been paying my rent.
好吧 他已經拖欠房貸九十天以上了
Well, yeah, he is over 90 days delinquent.
說真的
Seriously, man.
我會被趕出去嗎
Am I gonna have to leave?
我的小孩剛剛融入新學校啊夥計
'Cause my kid just got settled in school, man.
嗨 你好呀
Hey. How are ya?
我的名字叫肯
My name's Ken.
嗨 肯
You're Ken?
呃 這種事你應該跟你的房東談
Um, you should talk to your landlord about that.
很抱歉 其他的我都無可奉告
I'm sorry, I don't have any more information.
但是你 唉
But you, um...
祝你好運 回見 肯
You have a great day. See ya, Ken.
在哪兒都能上學的
There's books everywhere!
哪兒都有學校
Books everywhere?
說真的 不會出事吧
Seriously, man, is everything gonna be okay?
你應該 你應該給他打電話
You should... You should call him.
你真的應該給他打個電話
You should give him a call.
真的不怪我啊 哥們 我一直都有付房租
It's not my fault, dude. I've been paying...
有人嗎
Hello!
看上去像幽靈船一樣
Looks like the Mary Celeste.
你看 他們只帶走了電視
Look. All they took was the TV.
真奇怪
It's weird.
他們甚至連貓砂都沒有清
They didn't even clean out the cat litter.
哦天哪
Oh, GOG.
簡直像切爾諾貝利一樣
It's like Chernobyl.
這裏大概有一百棟房子
There's like a hundred houses.
但是住在這裏的不超過四個
There can't be four people living here.
-哎呀我操 -媽的
- Oh, fuck that! - Shit!
他在裏面已經七個小時了
He's been in there for seven hours.
要上廁所怎麼辦
Where does he go to the bathroom?
我聽說他已經破罐破摔了
I heard he had a breakdown.
他正在轉讓基金
He's letting the fund tank.
我曼哈頓的一個哥們說
My buddy in Manhattan said...
這裏是巴裏先生辦公室
Dr. Burry's office.
不 你給他發郵件會更好
No, he actually prefers that you email him.
不好意思
Excuse me.
菲爾茲先生
Mr. Fields, Mr...
-嗨 勞倫斯 -媽個雞
- Hi, Lawrence. - Holy shit!
對於你所謂分析宏觀經濟波動的能力
We have no confidence in your ability to identify
我們深表懷疑
macroeconomic trends.
你飛這麼大老遠來就是為了告訴我這個嗎
You flew here to tell me that? Why?
是個人都能看出房地產行業有泡沫
Anyone can see that there is a real estate bubble.
事實上我們都沒看出來
Actually, no one can see a bubble.
所以這才叫泡沫 因為根本就是虛幻的
That's what makes it a bubble.
你這話蠢透了 勞倫斯
That's dumb, Lawrence.
一切都有特徵
There's always markers.
自從2000年以來
Mortgage fraud has
貸款欺詐已經翻了五倍
quintupled since 2000
實際上實得工資並沒有上漲多少
and the average take-home pay is flat,
但房價卻一直在飆升
but home prices are soaring.
這就意味著 房屋已經變成了債務而非財產
That means the homes are debt, not assets.
所以聖何塞的邁克爾·巴裏
So Mike Burry of San Jose, a guy who
一個在沙宣剪頭髮 鞋都不穿的男人
gets his hair cut at Supercuts and doesn't wear shoes,
比艾倫·格林斯潘和漢克·保爾森更有資格發言 是嗎
knows more than Alan Greenspan and Hank Paulson.
事實上
Well...
我是邁克爾·巴裏博士 而且我說的是對的
Dr. Mike Burry, yes, he does.
你真可愛
That's cute. That's cute.
你這是在諷刺我們嗎 邁克爾
Are you being sarcastic with us, Mike?
勞倫斯
Lawrence,
我不知道怎樣諷刺別人
I don't know how to be sarcastic.
我也不知道怎樣搞笑
I don't know how to be funny. I don't know how to
也不知道怎麼領導別人
work people.
我只是對數字很敏感而已
I just know how to read numbers.
你現在的空頭頭寸有多大了
How big is your short position right now?
呃
Urn...
十三億美金而已
Just $1.3 billion.
那額外費用呢
And the premiums?
我們大約
Well, we pay. Uh.
每年付八千到九千萬
Roughly $80 to 90 million
這價格挺高的
each year, which is high,
但是我是這項貿易的第一人
but I was the first to do this trade.
看好了 早晚會收到回報的 可能現在言之過早 但我說的一定沒錯
Watch. It will pay. I may have been early, but I'm not wrong.
言之過早和大錯特錯根本就沒有多大差別 邁克爾
It's the same thing. It's the same thing, Mike!
你手裏的基金有多少 5.55億嗎
You're managing a fund of, what, $555 million?
六年內 你就會血本無歸
In six years, it'll all be gone.
敢打賭嗎
On one bet.
你錯了
No, the second quarter
2007年第二季度 可調利率抵押貸款會發揮作用
of '07 is when the adjustable rates kick in.
貸款違約率將會暴漲
The defaults will skyrocket.
只有你這麼說
Yeah. Says you.
在違約之前有多大一部分能夠合法收回呢
How much is eligible for withdrawal before they do?
比如說 在接下去的兩個季度內
Say, in the next two quarters.
如果你的投資人覺得風險太大的話
If your investors panic.
3.02個億嗎
$302 million?
天啊 麥克
My God, Mike.
沒有人會退出的 那簡直就是自殺
No one will pull out. That would be suicide.
我是說 我一年內虧了十七個百分點
I mean, I'm down 17% for the year.
但是假如他們相信我的話 而且他們一定會相信我的 因為
But if they trust me, and they trust me, because...
沒有人會相信你 別做夢了
No one trusts you! No one!
我給投資人發了好幾封郵件
I sent several emails to my investors
告知他們
letting them know that the...
2007年的第二季度
...the second quarter of '07 is when our
我們的房地產業務將會迎來回報
housing positions show returns and...
我在裏面說的很清楚了
I've been very clear.
人們會把錢取出來的
People will withdraw their money.
勞倫斯 那樣就太蠢了 我的意思是
Lawrence, that would be so stupid. I mean, the...
如果基金的資本貶值太厲害的話
if the fund's capitals drop too much,
掉期合約就無效了
then the swaps contracts are voided.
然後銀行必須要留存所有的擔保物
And then the banks get to keep all of the collateral.
-你等會 -全部留存
- Wait a minute. Wait. - All of it.
掉期合約無效
The contracts are voided?
掉期合約會無效
The contracts are voided?
我操
Holy shit!
我了個大槽
Oh, motherfucker!
邁克爾
Michael?
我要收回投資
Give me my money back.
邁克爾 你聽見我說話了嗎 把錢還給我
Michael, do you hear me? I want my money back.
你他媽的把錢還給我
Give me my fucking money back...
媽的智障
...you motherfucker.
如今的市場只是有一點極小的波動
The market's in an itsy-bitsy little gully right now.
就像大家說的 是有點瘋狂
It's like everybody said, "Okay, that was crazy.
但是我們可以鎮靜一點
"Let's just all calm down."
在房子建成的那一年 我賣了35萬美元
I sold that house for $350,000 the year it was built.
兩年後 成交價是48萬
Two years later, $480,000.
大概一年半以前 漲到了58.5萬
Then $585,000 maybe 18 months ago.
去年這對夫妻買進花了65萬
This couple bought it for $650,000 last year.
他現在願意原價賣出
He'd let it go for that.
嗨 約翰
Hi, John.
不不不
No, no, no.
雖然很難過 但他還是會賣的
It will break his heart, but he'll let it go.
他為什麼要賣
Why is he selling?
因為他們夫妻倆現在失業了
Neither one's working right now.
瑪琳 他們都很積極 對吧
Marlene, you'd say they're motivated, right?
這裏每個人都有差不多這麼積極
As motivated as one can be in this neighborhood.
左手邊這套房子 他們很積極要出售
This house on the left, I would say they're probably motivated.
哇 積極的人還真不少
Wow, a lot of people seem very motivated.
經濟波動而已
Oh, it's just the gully.
沒別的原因
That's all. Just...
有些人過於緊張了
Just nerves.
所以我們看哪一家
So where do we stand?
我得先跟我妻子談談
I need to talk to my wife. Um...
市場不會一直這樣下去的
This market won't last.
事實上 我想跟房貸經紀人談談
Actually, could I talk to a mortgage broker?
你有推薦的人選嗎 隨便誰都可以
Anybody you recommend? Anybody you like.
有的 當然可以
Yes, yes, I have someone. Absolutely.
哈哈 那個臭娘們
Yeah, bitch better like me.
騷的一比
Sent her ass to Cabo.
所以摩根斯坦利是要聘用我們嗎
So is Morgan Stanley recruiting us? Is that it?
哦不是的 我們的對沖基金在那家銀行
Oh, no. No. The bank owns our hedge fund,
但是我們實際上不是銀行的人
but we're not really part of it.
我們投資一些財務公司
We invest in financial service companies
我們在研究房屋貸款行業
and we're trying to understand the residential mortgage business.
你們每個月發放多少筆貸款啊
How many loans do you write each month?
-大概六十筆吧 -沒錯
- About 60. -Yeah.
四年前呢
What was it four years ago?
十筆
Ten.
或者十五
Maybe 15.
那時候我還是個酒吧招待 現在我已經有私人遊艇了
Yeah, I was a bartender. Now I own a boat.
你有私人遊艇
You own a...
所以有多大一部分是可調利率房貸
So how many of these are adjustable-rate mortgages?
-呃 大部分都是 -沒錯
- Well, most. - Oh, yeah.
我估計有百分之九十吧
Yeah, I'd say about 90%.
這部分業務的紅利幾年前簡直是飆升
The bonuses on those skyrocketed a few years ago.
可調利率房貸簡直是我們的命根子
Adjustable's our bread and honey.
所以申請人會被拒絕嗎
So do applicants ever get rejected?
你在搞笑嗎
Seriously?
如果拒絕的話 我還干個毛啊
Look, if they get rejected, I suck at my job.
就算他們沒錢還貸款也不拒絕嗎
Even if they have no money?
我們公司可以放忍者貸款喔
Well, my firm offers NINJA loans.
-是嗎 -給那些沒有工作和收入的人
- Okay. - "No Income, No Job."
所以如果沒收入 我就空掉那一欄好了
I just leave the income section blank if I want.
公司才不在乎呢
Corporate doesn't care.
那些人只是想買個房而已 大家不都這樣嗎
These people just want homes. And they go with the flow.
你真善良
Good for you.
你的公司不篩選的嗎
Your companies don't verify?
如果我禮拜五下午發放一筆貸款
If I write a loan on Friday afternoon,
那麼禮拜一中午之前就會有大銀行收購
a big bank will buy it by Monday lunch.
我們這裏也是一樣
Yeah. Same here.
你能稍等一會嗎
Could you hold on a second?
好啊
Yeah.
我不明白 他們怎麼毫不避諱就說出來了
I don't get it. Why are they confessing?
他們根本就不想避諱
They're not confessing.
反而是在炫耀
They're bragging.
貸款的人真的知道自己在買什麼嗎
Do people have any idea what they are buying?
我的業務重點是移民 你知道的
I focus on the immigrants, you know.
只要告訴他們 能買到房子
Once they find out they're getting a home,
你讓他們在哪簽字 他們都二話不說就簽
they sign where you tell them to sign.
不需要問清楚細節 也不需要弄明白利率
Don't ask questions. Don't understand the rates.
-媽的智障 -沒錯
- Fucking idiots. -Yeah.
你的工作重點也在移民嗎
And you target immigrants, too?
他關注的人比那些人信用差多了
Well, their credit actually isn't bad enough for him.
我是個向錢看的人
Look, I'm a yield guy.
好吧
Okay...
每一筆固定利率貸款 我都賺兩千塊
I make $2,000 on a fixed-rate prime loan, right?
但是可變利率房貸呢 我每筆賺一萬
But I can make $10,000 on a subprime adjustable.
沒有那些脫衣舞女 我可開不上開寶馬七系
Trust me, I'm not driving a 7 Series without strippers.
她們都沒有什麼信用 但是都很有錢
No one on the pole has good credit and they're all cash rich.
我記得沃倫·巴菲特說過同樣的話
I think I read Warren Buffett say something like that.
什麼 沃倫·巴菲特是誰
What? Who's Warren Buffett?
脫衣舞女是什麼 那種外國舞孃嗎
Okay, so strippers. Like exotic dancers?
是啊
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
裸體的喔 沒穿內衣那種
Nude, you know, topless.
-脫衣舞女 -是啊
- Strippers. -Yeah.
你能介紹給我們嗎
Can you introduce us?
好啊
Yes! Yes.
我總是申請可調利率房貸 我是自由職業者
I always get option-pay adjustables. I'm a private contractor.
什麼 不好意思 我聽不清
What? I can't hear you. I'm sorry.
我總是申請可調利率房貸
I always get option-pay adjustables.
我是個自由職業者 我需要靈活度
I'm a private contractor. I need flexibility.
你會告訴貸款公司你的職業嗎
And you tell the mortgage company what you do?
我寫的是治療師
I write "Therapist".
-你可以摸我 -一直嗎
- You can touch me. -Always?
在貴賓室才可以
Only in V.I.P.
不不不 我的意思是 你說你一直申請可調利率房貸
No, no, no, you say you always do adjustables.
對於一處房產你會申請好幾個貸款嗎
And you have more than one loan on a property?
大家都這樣 至少我們是這樣
Everybody does. At least down here.
不好意思 你說什麼
I'm sorry, what?
我說至少在我們這 大家都是這樣的
Everybody does. At least down here.
這樣的話你只需要付大概百分之五
That way you only put down, like, 5%.
房價趨於平緩了 是吧
Prices have leveled off, though, right?
是啊 現在經濟波動
Yeah. There's a gully.
你可以別晃悠了嗎 價錢我會照付
Would you mind not moving anymore? I'll still pay you.
不好意思 老闆在看著
Sorry. We're not alone.
好吧 如果房價不再升高的話
Okay, look. If home prices don't go up,
你就沒辦法轉重新貸款了
you are not going to be able to refinance.
那你就必須要付清月供
And you'll be stuck paying whatever your monthly payment is
一旦你的抵押貸款到期的話 月供會飆升
once it jumps up after your teaser rate expires.
可能會翻兩三倍
Your monthlies could go up 200%-300%.
詹姆斯說我肯定可以重新貸款的
James says I can always refinance.
那他騙你了
Well, he's a liar.
事實上 在這個案例上 詹姆斯很可能是錯的
Actually, in this particular case, James probably is wrong.
翻兩倍 我所有那些貸款都翻兩倍嗎
200 percent? On all my loans?
什麼叫你所有那些貸款
What do you mean "All" Your loans?
你不是有一套房子申請了兩個貸款嗎
We're talking about two loans on one house, right?
我有五套房
I have five houses.
還有一個公寓
And a condo.
房產泡沫是真的
Hey, there's a bubble.
你怎麼知道
How do you know?
相信我 打電話給維內特 買進五千萬的房產抵押掉期
Trust me. Call Vennett, buy $50 million in swaps on the MBS.
買哪個 加裏波第四期 3B評級
What do we got? Garibaldi IV, BBB.
馬克 你確定嗎
Mark, are you sure?
我確定 徹底沒救了
Yeah. Yeah, it's time to call bullshit.
-什麼沒救了 -什麼都沒救了
- Bullshit on what? -Every fucking thing.
對沖基金打來的
FrontPoint! FrontPoint!
是全美火氣最大的對沖基金嗎
Is this America's angriest hedge fund?
聽好了 我問你最後一個問題
All right, listen. I got one last question for you.
你想怎麼糟蹋我們
How are you fucking us?
說話別這麼沖嘛 維尼
There's a nicer way to say that, Vinnie.
我是認真的
I'm serious.
我們會買你的掉期交易 前提是你要告訴我 你想怎麼糟蹋我們
We'll buy your swaps, but only if you say how you're fucking us.
我才沒有糟蹋 我是在親吻你們
I'm not fucking you, Vinnie. I'm kissing you.
我是在看著你的眼睛 讓你爽翻天 維尼
I'm looking deep into your eyes as I make love to you, Vinnie.
我提供的可是這個世紀以來最棒的交易
I'm handing you the deal of the century on a fucking platter.
我能得到什麼好處 很簡單
What do I get out of it? Easy.
我每個月有兩千萬負盈利
I got a $20-million-a-month negative carry.
老闆們試圖中斷我的項目
I got bosses trying to pull the plug
因為他們覺得我他媽瘋了
because they think I'm out of my fucking mind.
好嗎
All right?
我們達成這個交易
We make this trade,
那麼這些都不是事了
those problems aren't so big anymore.
沒錯 掉期交易是個水很深的市場 所以我來定價
And sure, swaps are a dark market, so I set the price.
我想定多少就定多少
Whatever price I want.
而到了付錢那天
And when you come for the payday,
我能把你底褲都拿走 那時候我就發財了
I'm gonna rip your eyes out, I'm gonna make a fortune.
但是好消息是 維尼 你不會介意這個的
But the good news is, Vinnie, you're not gonna care
因為你可以狠賺一筆
because you're gonna make so much fucking money.
這就是我的好處
That's what I get out of it.
想知道你能得到什麼好處嗎
Want to know what you get out of it?
你能拿到冰淇淋 熱奶油 香蕉 榛仁
You get the ice cream, the hot fudge, the banana, and the nuts.
我現在得到的只有彩砂糖
Right now, I get the sprinkles, and, yeah,
而如果這項交易成功的話 我還能得到櫻桃
if this goes through, I get the cherry.
但是維尼 你得到的是整個冰淇淋的其他部分
But you get the sundae, Vinnie.
整個喔
You get the sundae.
好吧 我買了 謝謝
All right, I buy that. Thank you.
所以你怎麼想
So what do you say?
-要我幫你打開市場嗎 -是的
- You want me to make you a market? -Yeah.
我們買五千萬的加裏波第四期 3B評級
We'll take $50 million, Garibaldi IV, BBB.
準備好簽字吧 我這就準備文件
Sharpen your pencils. I'll get the paperwork ready.
操你媽
Fuck you, too.
耶
Yes!
好極了
That's right.
天啊
Oh, man.
他電話號碼太多了 我總是忘記打哪一個
He has so many numbers, and I always forget
他有說過應該打哪一個
which one he prefers, because he's very specific.
從第一個開始吧
Start with the first one.
我不知道這是不是第一個
I don't know if it's the first one.
試試看好了
Just try it.
好吧
Okay. I... Okay.
-我是本·裏克特 -嗨本 我是傑米
- Ben Rickert. - Hey, Ben. It's Jamie.
傑米 你不應該打這個號碼的
Jamie, you know you're not supposed to use this line.
就說吧
Told you.
好吧 那我們再試試第二個 總共十四個
Okay, let's try number two out of 14.
我是本·裏克特
Ben Rickert.
本 幹嘛掛我電話
Ben, why do you do that, man? I mean...
你都已經退休了 好嗎 沒人監聽你電話了
You're a retired trader, okay? No one is listening to your calls.
美國國家安全局在這方面投了520億的預算
The NSA has a $52 billion budget and the ability
他們完全有能力同時監聽幾億個電話
to monitor tens of millions of calls a second.
你覺得他們這個系統是擺設嗎
You think they're not using it?
我保證不會在一個句子裏同時出現
Hey, I promise I will refrain from saying
本·裏克特和髒彈這兩個詞的好嗎
"Ben Rickert" And "Dirty bomb" In the same sent...
-媽的智障 -真抱歉
- Jesus fucking Christ. -I'm sorry, dude.
我是本·裏克特
Ben Rickert.
本 你能不能抽空看一下我們發的東西
Did you get a chance to look at what we sent you, Ben?
我是查理 我跟傑米在一起
It's Charlie. I'm here, too.
嗨查理 我看了 你等一下
Hi, Charlie. Yeah, I did. Hold on.
本 你還在嗎
Ben, you still there?
在
Yeah.
我說實話 兩位
I'll be honest, gentlemen.
我真的受到了驚嚇
It scared the shit out of me.
但這是一件好事 不是嗎
But that's a good thing, right?
這意味著維內特這傢伙沒有說錯
That means this Vennett guy's not wrong.
確實沒有
No, he's not.
好極了
Cool.
關於這些擔保債務憑證 還有什麼信息嗎
Tell me more about these CDOs.
有的 你知道維內特提到了擔保債務憑證
Yeah, yeah. Okay, so, you know, Vennett mentions the CDOs,
但是實際上 我們看過
but actually, we took a look
情況比他預想的還要糟糕
and they're way worse than even he realizes.
這些東西簡直就是瘋了
These things don't make any sense!
我們甚至都沒法建模
We can't even model them.
這些比房貸證券規模還要大一百倍
These are 100 times bigger than the MBS.
而且百分之九十是3A評級的
And 90% AAA-rated.
-是的沒錯 -超過百分之九十
- Yes! Exactly! -Over 90%.
真是難以置信
It's incredible.
我看了你們想做空的那些擔保債務憑證
I took a good hard look at the CDOs you want to short.
棒極了 簡直是一堆垃圾
They're brilliant. Worthless. Total crap.
傑米 棒極了
Jamie. Very good.
我該說什麼呢 我對於找茬還是很在行的
What can I say? I'm good at finding shit.
所以 本 我們空頭了那些2B和3B評級的
So, Ben, we shorted the BB's and the BBB 's,
相比較而言風險較小
and the risk is relatively low.
-回報率大概是25倍 -是的
- Payoff is, like, 25-to-1. -Yeah.
好啊 那麼你們為什麼打電話給我 我已經不幹這一行了
Okay, so, why are you calling me? I don't do this anymore.
嘿 本
Look, Ben?
我們需要你幫我們弄到ISDA協議
We need you to help us get the ISDA.
如果有持槍證的話 我們能省不少事
If we get a hunting license, we can short this crap.
我們知道你討厭華爾街那一套
And we know you hate Wall Street.
我們不是要你去做這單買賣
We're not asking you to do the trading.
我們只是想請你幫我們
We're simply asking you to help us get a seat
拿到資格
at the fucking table.
這可不是什麼好差事 夥計們
It's a pretty ugly table, guys.
聽著 本 整個金融系統岌岌可危了懂嗎
Look, Ben, the system fucked up in a big, big way here, okay?
而好巧不巧的
And somehow, uh,
我們率先得知這一點
we know before anyone else.
懂嗎 這可是樁千載難逢的買賣
You know? This is a once-in-a-lifetime deal.
讓我考慮考慮
I'm thinking.
好吧 我會打給德意志銀行
Okay. I'll call Deutsche Bank.
謝謝你 本 謝謝
Thank you, Ben. Thank you.
對了 還有貝爾斯登公司 他們有一堆想甩掉的垃圾產品
And Bear. What about Bear? They have some reprehensible product.
可以 只要有人買他們就肯賣
Okay. Bear will trade with anybody.
好吧 我來試試看能不能成
All right. I'll see if I can push it through.
謝謝 諾阿 也替我們謝謝傑瑞德
Thank you, Noah. And thank Jared for us.
我們進去唄
Couldn't we go inside?
嗯 走吧
Yeah, me, too.
嗨 我是馬克 快讓維尼接電話
Hi. It's Mark. I need to talk to Vinnie right now.
我們需要你們解釋
We're just asking you to explain to us
你們對我們的所作所為
just how it is that you are fucking us,
因為我們發現
because what we are seeing...
摩根士丹利大廈 快點
Morgan Stanley building, fast.
大家都在糾結同樣的事嗎
Are we hooked up to the same computer screen?
這沒有任何意義
It doesn't make any sense.
維尼 是你嗎
Vinnie, you there?
馬克 是你呀
Mark, you there?
是啊 聽說了嗎
Yeah, did you hear?
房貸違約都多到突破天際了
Mortgage defaults have gone through the roof.
有人跳樓了沒
Is anybody jumping off of buildings yet?
幹嘛要跳 次貸債券價格可漲起來了
Why would they? Subprime mortgage bond prices are up.
什麼
What?
維內特想要在收盤前再增加一千九百萬擔保
Vennett wants $1.9 million more in collateral by close.
維內特讓我們再加擔保
Vennett's asking us to post collateral.
到底怎麼回事
What the hell is going on?
不知道 但是德意志銀行正打電話來要我們付錢
We don't know, but Deutsche's on the phone demanding payment.
打電話給維內特 趕快給這混蛋打電話
Call Vennett. Call That little shit.
打給維內特 讓他馬上過來
Call Vennett. Tell him to get his ass down here.
所以次級貸款崩盤了
So subprime loans go bad,
但是次貸債券 也就是
but subprime bonds, which are
次級貸款變出來的東西反而漲價了是吧
made up of subprime loans, are more valuable?
我知道 但他們在收盤前還要一千九百萬
I know. They want another $1.9 million by market close.
那那些信用評級機構呢 穆迪呢 標普呢
What about the ratings agencies? Moody's, S&P...
他們有降低擔保債務憑證和抵押債權的評級嗎
Are they downgrading the CDOs and mortgage bonds?
評級機構有什麼動向嗎
Where are the ratings agencies at?
完全沒變
They're the fucking same.
沒變 評級還是三個A
No, they're all still AAA.
什麼鬼 你他媽在逗我
What the hell? Are you fucking kidding me?
這群小婊砸 賤人們
Those fuckers! Those motherfuckers!
他們上了市之後完全就
They go public, and all they
只關心利潤和自己那些破事
care about is their bottom line and their shit.
喂 馬克 還沒完呢
Hey, Mark, that's not all.
摩根史坦利那些風險評估員在這呢
The Morgan Stanley risk guys are here.
他們把凱西·陶叫來了
They called in Kathy Tao.
他們想說服她賣掉我們的掉期交易產品
They're trying to convince her to make us sell our swaps.
很顯然 在可能出現房地產大崩盤的情況下
Apparently, tying up six years of insurance payments
綁定為期六年的保險費用
in hopes of a housing Armageddon
不是明智的投資
is not prudent investing.
凱西怎麼說
What did Kathy say?
她還沒表態 她一直在問這是不是你的一項改革措施
Nothing yet. She keeps asking if this is one of your crusades.
好 那你就進去吧
Okay, I want you to walk back in there
要保持冷靜 注意禮貌
and very calmly, very politely,
讓那些風險評估員滾蛋
tell the risk assessors to fuck off.
然後來標準普爾公司見我
And then meet me over at Standard & Poors.
我們跟喬治亞談談
We're gonna talk to Georgia.
收到 好
All right. Okay.
讓混蛋傑瑞德·維內特滾過來
Get that fuck Jared Vennett in this office.
我要打爆他的腦袋
I'm gonna bash his fucking head in.
呃 先生們
Uh, gentlemen?
我跟馬克·巴姆談過了 他讓你們滾蛋
I spoke with Mark Baum. He says to fuck off.
我什麼都看不見啊
I can't see a damn thing.
我的眼科醫生總是沒空
My eye doctor's always busy.
最後我完全服從他們的安排
I end up taking any appointment they'll give me,
然後整個上午都打水漂咯
and then the whole morning gets shot to hell!
那麼
So...
好吧
All righiy.
對沖基金的夥伴們
FrontPoint Partners,
標準普爾能為您做些什麼呢
how can Standard & Poor's help you?
嗯 我們不明白為什麼
Well, we don't understand why
評級公司還沒有下調次貸債券的等級
the ratings agencies haven't downgraded subprime bonds
明明基礎貸款都在不斷惡化了
since the underlying loans are clearly deteriorating.
嗯 不當評級確實讓人們憂慮
Well, the delinquency rates do have people worried,
但是這種情況都在我們的模型中
but they're actually within our models.
-所以 -請講
- So... - Says you.
你們相信目前債券所代表的
...you're convinced the underlying mortgages
基礎房貸都很穩固可靠
in these bonds are solid loans.
正是如此 是的
That is our opinion, yes.
你們看過貸款率的數據沒有
Have you looked at the loan-level data?
我的意思是 他們只看信用評級
I mean, they're giving these loans
就可以盲目地把錢貸給任何人
to anybody with a credit score and a pulse.
不好意思 先生 您以為我們每天都在這做什麼
Excuse me, sir. What do you think we do here all day?
我們不清楚 所以才來這
We're not sure. That's why we're here.
關於這一點我不是很懂
Here's what I don't understand...
我們一遍又一遍地檢查
We check, recheck, recheck again.
如果這些房貸債券這麼穩固的話
If these mortgage bonds are so stable...
或許您應該查查您的夥伴
Perhaps you could check your friend.
你有沒有拒絕過
...have you ever refused to rate...
女士 那不可能的
Ma'am, that's delusional.
我們隱居幕後
We stand behind them.
喬治亞 你有沒有拒絕過
Georgia, have you ever refused to rate
給這些債券評三個A
any of these bonds upper tranches AAA?
我們可以看看這些評級的書面記錄嗎
Can we see the paperwork on those deals?
我沒有義務出示這些信息給你們
I am under no obligation to share that information
不論你們是誰
with you, whoever you might be.
回答我的問題 喬治亞
Just answer the question, Georgia.
在這一年裏你有沒有過 哪怕一次
Can you name one time in the past year
在你檢查過材料以後
where you checked the tape
沒有按銀行的意思給他們三A等級的
and you didn't give the banks the AAA percentage they wanted?
如果我們不給他們想要的評級
If we don't give them the ratings,
他們就會去找穆迪公司 就在樓下
they'll go to Moody's, right down the block.
我們要是不按他們的意思來 他們就會去找我們的對手
If we don't work with them, they will go to our competitors.
不能怪我們 世道就這樣
Not our fault. Simply the way the world works.
-媽的 -好了 這下你們明白了
Holy shit. -Yes, now you see.
當我什麼都沒說
And I never said that.
他們把評級當成賣錢的工具
They're selling ratings for fees.
簡直就是評級專賣店
A ratings shop.
你們完全可以少掙點的 也能運營啊
You can afford to make less. Make less.
可沒人這麼說
Nobody said that.
這不關我的事 是領導決定的
And it is not my decision. I have a boss.
你逗我呢吧
Are you kidding me?
不 我才沒「逗你」
No, I am not "Kidding you".
你領導在上市的時候是怎麼做的
How'd your boss do on the IPO?
你心裏就是這麼想的嗎
Is that the angle you're taking?
這下好了 凡是上頭有領導的人都用不著
So, now, anyone who has a boss can't be held responsible
為違法亂紀的事擔責任了
for doing shitty and illegal things.
你是什麼 四歲小孩嗎
What are you, four?
不 我不是四歲小孩 巴姆先生 我不是
No, I am not four, Mr. Baum. I am not, no.
而且我很好奇你們的動機是什麼
And I wonder what your incentives might be.
對你們來說調整評級
Is it maybe in your best interest
有什麼好處嗎 有好處吧 是不是
to have the ratings change? Is it, perhaps?
你們買了多少信用違約掉期
How many credit default swaps do you own'? Hmm?
可我並沒有做錯什麼
It doesn't make me wrong.
不
No.
只是讓你變成偽君子
It just makes you a hypocrite.
操
Fuck!
房貸違約增加了
BEN". Mortgage delinquencies went up
而房貸債券反而漲起來了 難以置信
and the CDOs got more valuable Unbelievable.
-難以置信 -我們知道 完全反了啊
- Unbelievable. - We know. It's completely backwards.
我剛剛打給了貝爾斯登的朋友
I just called an old friend at Bear.
他甚至都不知道擔保債務憑證是什麼
He didn't even know what a CDO is.
是啊 我剛給貝爾斯登和德意志銀行匯去七萬塊
Yeah, I just had to wire Bear and Deutsche $70,000.
簡直就是二加二等於
It's like two plus two equals
無啊
fish.
黑幕 我們陷入了一場陰謀
It's rigged. We bought into a rigged game.
我們會失去一切的
We're gonna lose everything.
我就快要搬回去跟老媽一起住了
I'm gonna have to move back in with my mom.
做不到啊
Can't do that.
好吧 嗯 我還要去看看腸胃
All right. Well, I got a colonic appointment.
等一下 等等 本
Wait a minute. Hold on, Ben.
本 聽著
Ben, look.
要麼是銀行笨到
Either the banks are clueless
不知道怎麼評估擔保債務憑證
and they don't know how to value these CDOs,
要麼就是他們是大騙子 明知道擔保債務憑證就是一堆垃圾
or they're such crooks that the CDOs are worth shit
還隱瞞不說
and they're hiding it.
我覺得我們應該再多買點掉期
I think we should buy more swaps.
你說啥
What?
閉嘴付錢 夥計們 說好了的
Suck it up and pay up, fellas. We made a deal.
門都沒有 不要
No way! No!
你他媽逗我呢
Are you fucking kidding me?
你說真的嗎 你以為這是過家家嗎
Are you serious? You think this is a game?
不行 不行 不行
No. No. No. No. No.
是的 是的
Yeah. Yeah.
不行 不行
No! No! No!
不行 說真的 不然你每年檢查結腸一次
No, seriously, a colonic once a year.
混蛋
Ass!
還有個小男寵呢吧 你個混蛋
And you got a matching little butler boy, you buttfuck!
-罵完了沒 -完了 嗯
- Are you done? - I think so, yeah.
天吶 我都吼得後背拉傷了
God! I pulled a muscle in my back from yelling.
噢
Ow!
房貸違約一直在攀升
Mortgage defaults have done nothing but go up.
然而你給我們的債券報價也越來越高了
Yet you quote us a higher price on the bonds.
請你解釋一下 根本沒道理這麼做的
Please explain that to me. There's no way that makes sense.
你不可能準確恰當地評估這些掉期的
There's no way you're marking these swaps appropriately.
我們為什麼不現在就退出呢
Why shouldn't we back out of this trade right now?
我不是說過嗎 在我們做這樁買賣的時候
Didn't I say when we made this deal
無論評級公司 證監會
that the ratings agencies, the SEC
還是大銀行都傻傻搞不清狀況 我說沒說過
and the big banks were clueless? Didn't I say that?
-說了 -我說過沒有
Yes. -Didn't I say it?
是 你說了 說了
Yes, you did. You did.
閉嘴吧
Shut up.
現在他們吃到苦頭了 他們覺得
Now their foot's on fire, they think
好處也撈得差不多了 你們驚訝個什麼勁呢
their steak is done, and you're surprised?
那不是傻 是欺詐
That's not stupidity. That's fraud.
給我區分一下愚蠢和犯罪唄
Tell me the difference between stupid and illegal,
然後就可以讓我的小舅子被捕了
and I'll have my wife's brother arrested.
挺有趣的
That was funny.
我覺得你們只是沒意識到整個系統有多無能
I guess you just don't realize how clueless the system really is.
的確 是有某種黑幕即將落下
Yes, there's some shady shit going down,
但是相信我 造成這一切的是愚昧
but trust me, it's fueled by stupidity!
看看你們自己吧
Look at yourselves.
看看你們 你們自詡憤世嫉俗
You know, you pass yourself off as cynical people
但你們仍舊對這個系統還抱有某種信念 是不是
but you still have some faith in the system, don't you?
並沒有
I don't.
好 除了維尼 但是有誰在乎呢
Well, except for Vinnie. And who gives a shit?
-不行 -聽著
No way! -Look...
無論我們對還是錯 這都是一場豪賭
Either we're right or we're wrong in a giant, giant way.
一旦我們賭錯了 我們就必須找人
And if we're wrong, then we got to find someone
幫我們脫離苦海
to help us get out of this trade.
我一點也不覺得我們是對的
I'm not feeling remotely confident that we're right.
一旦我們是錯的 有誰能告訴我們怎麼辦嗎
And if we're wrong, who's gonna tell us?
誰能懂啊 胡說八道
Who understands this stuff? It makes no sense!
我們應該去一趟拉斯維加斯
BEN". I think we need to go to Vegas.
-拉斯維加斯有什麼 -拉斯維加斯
- What's in Vegas? -Vegas?
拉斯維加斯到底有什麼
What the hell's in Las Vegas?
下周要在那舉辦美國證券論壇
The American Securitization Forum is there next week.
所有證券和擔保債務憑證銷售人員 次貸債權人
Every bond and CDO salesman, subprime lender
還有掉期交易員都會去
and swap trader is gonna be there.
我跟你們講 你們的對手是一堆傻蛋
I'm telling you, your bet is against dumb money.
是時候讓你們看看傻蛋的錢多好掙了
It's about time you find out just how dumb that money really is.
老天 我恨死拉斯維加斯了
God, I hate Vegas.
我聽說拉斯維加斯有好吃的
I hear the food has gotten really good in Vegas.
連日料店都有哦
They have a Nobu now.
你他媽閉嘴行不行
Would you fucking stop it?
有什麼想法
Any sense?
如果說一支債券很「貴重」那就是說它
And if a bond is "Rich" It is...
不知道 資產充足嗎
I don't know, loaded with assets?
「貴重」只說明它的估價偏高
"Rich" Just means overpriced.
我在飛機上睡不著 所以做了點功課
I can't sleep on planes, so I did my homework.
好了 回到正題 我們的目標是
Okay, let's focus. What's our goal?
搞明白這到底是個千載難逢的好機會
To figure out if this is a deal of a lifetime
還是所有人都知道一些我們不知道的內幕
or if everyone here knows something we don't
要是這樣的話我們就死定了
and we're gonna get royally screwed.
沒錯 記住當你們見到貝爾斯登的那些人時
Right. Remember that when you meet with the guys from Bear.
我會替你們弄到面談的機會
I set you up with a face-to-face.
-贊 -在哪啊
- Awesome. -Where is that?
簡直想不到 五年前的證券論壇還是個失敗者集會
Holy shit. Five years ago, Securitization was a loser convention.
只有一兩百人會參加
100, maybe 200 people would show.
一年五千億之後就變得這麼盛大了
$500 billion a year later, you get this.
這裏不少人都挺趾高氣揚的 是吧
There's a lot of smug-looking people in here, huh?
就像是有人聚集了
It's like someone hit a pifiata
一大堆不會打高爾夫的暴發戶白人
filled with white people who suck at golf.
我想說 這些人是來搞笑的嗎
I mean, who are all these clowns?
哦 得了 多好玩啊
Oh, come on. I think it looks fun.
當然了 維內特說
Certainly. Vennett says
我們的對手就是這些人
these are the people we're betting against.
-好了 行動 行動起來 -他在那
- Yeah, here we go. Here we go. - There he is.
克裏斯 站我左邊 克裏斯 到我左邊來
Chris, on my left. Chris, on my left.
先生們
Gentlemen.
我們什麼時候能有機會
When do we get a chance
跟你們這些可愛的人來次面談呢
to face time with some of these lovely folks?
克裏斯 把秘鑰卡給他
Chris, give him the keycards.
你知不知道你在發的是什麼秘鑰卡啊
Do you even know which keycards you're giving out?
-你就這麼隨便發出去啦 -謝謝
- You're just giving them out? -Thank you.
首先呢 你們旅途還順利吧 怎麼樣 平安無事吧
First of all, how was your travel? How are you? Uneventful?
-挺順利 -好
- Uneventful. -Okay.
我已經到了六個小時了 我去健身來著
I've been here for six hours. I've already been to the gym,
還吃了倆荷包蛋
I had two poached eggs
還跟哈利·迪安·斯坦頓打了二十一點
and I played blackjack with Harry Dean Stanton.
謝謝您的流水賬匯報
Thank you for your diary.
面談吧 我想跟你們談談
Face time. I'd like some face time.
記住 我們是來收集情報的
Just remember. We're here to gather information.
我們是來收集情報的
We're gathering information, okay?
我們不是來招短工的 明白嗎
We're not advertising our short position. All right?
我們不想驚動所有人 能做到嗎
We don't want to spook everybody. Can you do that'?
我知道你嘴上沒個把門的 總說個沒完
I know you got a big mouth, you like to run it.
能不能消停老實幾天
Can you just keep it shut for a few days?
好好好
Okay. Okay.
沒事 放心吧 我們肯定圓滿完成任務
Yeah, don't worry. We'll play nice.
女士們先生們
Ladies and gentlemen.
行情很不錯
Business is good.
利潤十分可觀
Profits are strong
而房貸依然是整個經濟
and the mortgage continues to be the bedrock
得以發展的基石
on which this economy is built.
雖然 的確 我們去年被迫
And, yes, we had to take some losses
在次貸領域承受一些損失 但是這些損失
in our subprime department last year, but those losses
會被控制在百分之五以下
will be contained at only 5%.
如今 我們的住房住宅業務
Now, in our residential sector...
馬克 這不是問答環節
Mark, it's not a Q and A.
我們推出的可變利率組合產品
...our rollout of those variable rate packages
被搶購一空
were gobbled up by the consumers!
不好意思我有個疑問
I have a question, please.
呃
Uh...
先生 我的演講之後才是問答環節
Sir, the Q and A is after my statements.
但是 你看起來挺焦慮的 我能為你做些什麼嗎
But you know what? You seem anxious. How can I help you?
-謝謝 你好嗎 -挺好 謝謝
- Thank you. How are you? -Fine, thank you.
你覺得次貸帶來的損失很有可能
Would you say that it is a possibility
會止步於百分之五嗎 還是說不一定
or a probability that subprime losses stop at 5%?
謝謝
Thank you.
我認為這十分有可能 沒錯
I would say it is a very strong probability, indeed.
那麼回到住房業務上來
So back to the residential sector.
當我們推出全新的可變利率組合產品時
When we rolled out the new variable rates package...
-不好意思 -呃
Excuse me. -Um...
請吧 先生
Yes, sir.
零蛋 零蛋
Zero! Zero!
你們的次貸損失會停留在百分之五以內的
There is a 0% chance
概率完全是零蛋
that your subprime losses will stop at 5%.
零蛋
Zero.
不好意思
Excuse me.
我接個電話
I have to take this.
他肯定是美國銀行派來的
He must be from Bank of America.
我們的次貸部門狀況良好
Our subprime department is fine.
沒 我現在沒什麼事情
No, I'm not doing anything right now.
正如我所說 住房領域
As I was saying, our residential department...
孩子們怎麼樣
How are the kids?
消費者對我們的組合產品反應良好
...consumers reacted to our packages...
馬克·巴姆真的這麼做了
Mark Baum really did that.
我們在拉斯維加斯的時候他真的這麼做了
When we were in Vegas, he did that.
他說完了就接電話去了
He said that, he took the call.
現在你明白我的處境了吧
Now you see what I had to deal with?
對 貝雷塔槍是遜了點
Yeah, the Beretta... Meh.
但是這把烏茲衝鋒鎗簡直帥爆了
But this Uzi is fucking awesome!
只要CDO再撐兩年
I need this CDO machine to run for another two years.
我就能狠狠撈一筆再在阿斯彭買個房子
And then I'm rich as fuck and I got my house in Aspen.
但是你就一點不擔心
But do you have any concerns about the performance
現在的證券走勢嗎
of the underlying securitizations?
很明顯違約率
It's easy to see that delinquencies
和失信率都在上升啊
and default rates are on the rise right now.
你們能不能別再潑冷水了 哥們
Could you please stop being such a buzzkill, dude?
我們帶你們來這可不是為了談工作啊 夥計
We didn't bring you out here to talk about work, bro.
那你們帶我們來是為了什麼
Why did you bring us out here?
因為我們得找客戶報銷打槍的錢
Because we need to be able to expense the ammo to a client.
我要去打恐怖分子啦 好好看著點 年輕人
I'm gonna go shoot some terrorists. Watch how it's done, boys!
這些人是蠢蛋嗎
These guys are morons.
-好槍法 -喔
- Fucking tool. -Whoo!
這些人是蠢蛋
These guys are morons.
好樣的 哇卡卡
Fuck, yes! Boom!
好樣的 夥計
Yeah, man!
我們得在這裏盡一切可能多買掉期
We need to be buying up every swap we can get our hands on here.
別急啊 好嗎 別急
Just hold on, okay? Hold on.
我弟弟的前女友在證監會工作
My brother's ex-girlfriend works for the SEC.
她剛告訴我她就在附近
She just told me she's in town, okay?
所以 如果我們有什麼不知道的 沒準她能告訴我們
So, if we're missing something, maybe she can tell me.
你懂的 她能告訴我們一些情報
You know, give me some insight.
與此同時呢 你去一樓
In the meantime, you go to the main floor
問問掉期的價格
and price some swaps.
嗯 事實上 我們準備
Well, actually, we're
投資一些住房債券 但是
about to invest in housing bonds, and...
我很好奇證監會對這些債券有沒有什麼擔憂
I was wondering if the SEC is worried about them at all.
我知道你不能
I know you're not allowed
說得很具體 但是大概說說就行
to tell me specifics, but just generally.
哦 我們從不調查房貸債券
Oh, we don't investigate mortgage bonds.
其實呢 因為資金有限 所以我們調查的不是很多
Truth is, since we got our budget cut, we don't investigate much.
-那你來這幹嘛 我以為 -我不是出來公幹的
- Then why are you here? I thought... -I'm not here for the SEC.
我自費來的
I'm here on my own dime.
我準備跳槽去大銀行
I'm floating my resume to some big banks.
對了 你弟弟怎麼樣了
How's your brother, by the way?
你怎麼可能跳槽去大銀行呢
How are you floating your resume to big banks?
我是說 你的工作應該是
I mean, you're supposed to be the ones,
你懂的 監管那些大銀行啊
you know, policing the big banks.
成熟點吧 傑米
Grow up, Jamie.
肯定有法律禁止
There must be some kind of
做完監管工作之後
law against working for a financial institution
去被監管公司上班吧 對吧
right after you've been working in financial regulation, right?
不啊 沒有
No. No.
嘿 道奇
Hey! Dougie!
嘿 快過來 你在這幹嘛呢
Hey! Come over here. What are you doing at Caesars?
他在高盛工作
He's at Goldman.
再見啦
See you.
我們大概能做能百分之五的3B級別掉期交易
We can do BBB-level swaps at 500 basis points. Maybe.
你們給掉期標價標得好像債券要崩盤了一樣
You're pricing the swaps like the bond is gonna collapse
即使債券會升值是嗎 你說真的嗎
even though the bond value's going up? Really?
大勢如此罷了
Sign of the times.
到底怎麼回事
What the hell is going on'?
路易斯 你明天早點來 行嗎
Lewis, can you come in early tomorrow, please?
我要拋掉美國國際集團和全美金融公司
I need to unload the AIG and Countrywide
以及房地美的頭寸
and Freddie Mac positions
這樣我們才能負擔得起核心房貸
so that we can afford the premiums on the...
做空所需要的費用
...core mortgage shorts on the swaps.
沒問題 巴裏博士
No problem, Dr. Burry.
巴裏博士 嗯
"Dr. Burry? 'Hmm?
如果投資者們撤資的話
if the investors withdraw,
這裏會變成什麼樣 我們是不是就完蛋了
what's going to happen here? Are we done?
說實話 我不知道
Honestly, I don't know.
債券一直不下降
The bonds aren't going down.
價格也沒變 可能我們
They won't move. It's possible
陷進了一場大欺詐裏
that we are in a completely fraudulent system.
也可能是 你錯了
Or... You're wrong.
當然
Sure.
有可能是我錯了 只是不知道為什麼會錯
It's possible I'm wrong. I just don't know how.
我想犯錯的人 永遠
I guess when someone's wrong, they never...
不知道自己為什麼會錯
They never know how.
明早見
See you in the morning.
好
Yeah.
連貝爾斯登都上調價格了
Even Bear upped their prices.
他們還叫我們垃圾基金
And they keep calling us Brownhole.
你們只是沒錢沒地位罷了
You just don't have the money or the reputation.
別往心裏去
Don't take it personally.
今晚我沒有脫衣舞廳可去
I don't think I have the strip club in me tonight.
我就弄點薑汁啤酒看點付費節目算了
I'm just gonna get some ginger ale and watch some pay-per-view.
我會給咱們訂到明天早上的機票
I'll book us some flights out for the morning.
交易 我們需要做場交易 一單買賣
A deal. We need a deal, right? A deal.
我們需要成交一筆買得起的交易
We need a deal we can afford.
我們需要一筆不被拒絕的交易
We need a deal that they're not gonna refuse.
那麼 我們能做點什麼呢 我們可以
So... What can we do? We can...
2A級別的債券 我們賭在2A債券上怎麼樣
The AA tranches. What if we bet against the AA tranches?
有誰會拒絕呢
Who's not gonna take that bet?
我們知道他們說這些債券百分之九十五都是三A級
We know they say they're 95% AAA-rated,
但事實上可能只有百分之二十五是這樣
but in reality they're more like 25%.
有的根本就是百分之零
Some of them are 0%!
我們還知道要是超過百分之八的基礎債券崩了的話
We also know that if the bottom tranches fail at over 8%,
上層債券也會受影響
the upper tranches are affected.
它們會跌破谷底
They go to zero.
我敢打賭那些2A債券其實根本就是B級的
I'll bet you right now that those AA's are actually like B's.
雖然我很少這麼說 但是我覺得查理說的有道理
I rarely ever say these words, but I think Charlie's right.
看 本
Look, Ben.
回報率
The payoff
是二百倍
is 200 to 1.
但他們都在按面值估價
But they're all taking the ratings at face value.
所以賭2A債券會跌是小本大利的買賣
So they're charging pennies on the dollar a bet against the AA's.
我本來還覺得你們就是來搞笑的
Just when I start thinking you guys are clowns...
絕對沒人賭2A會跌
No one on the planet's betting against AA's.
銀行會覺得我們不是吃錯藥了就是有毛病
The banks will think we're either high or having a stroke.
我們想買多少他們都會照單全收的
They'll take every dime we have to offer.
有點厲害嘛
Kinda brilliant.
這點子沒人想到 只有但我們想到了
This is what we did that no one else thought of.
想到要做空2A債券
thought to short the AA's.
但我們想到了
But we did.
我們這個垃圾基金
Little Brown hole Capital.
我們想要做空一些2A級CDO
We're interested in shorting some of the AA tranche of CDOs.
別鬧 夥計們 你們想啥呢
Come on, guys, what's the angle?
哦 啥也沒想 我們對行情不太熟 就是玩玩
Oh, got no angle. We're new to this. We're just excited.
我們想在2A債券投一千五百萬的掉期
We want to do $15 million in swaps on the AA tranche.
我不明白
I don't understand.
你們想賣多少2A掉期都行
You can buy as much AA tranche as you want.
四千萬做空2A
$40 million against the AA.
老兄 你們想要多少都有
Brother, I will sell you as much as you want.
你理解得很透徹 鮑勃 成交嗎
You understand perfectly, Bob. You want the deal?
行啊 我沒問題
That's cool. That's all right with me.
我很榮幸
Pleasure.
成了
On!
別這樣 停停停
Don't do that. Stop. Stop.
-快停下 -查理
- Stop that. -Charlie.
給我停下 停
Stop it! Stop.
怎麼
What?
你們知道自己剛剛在幹嘛嗎
Do you have any idea what you just did?
拜託 我們剛剛完成了千載難逢的大買賣
Come on. We just made the deal of our lifetimes!
就慶祝一下嘛
We should celebrate.
你們剛剛跟整個美國經濟對著賭了
You just bet against the American economy.
哇哈哈 是啊是啊
Fuck, yeah, we did!
-哇哈哈 -也就是說
- Fuck, yeah! -Which means...
也就是說如果我們賭對了
Which means if we're right...
如果我們賭對了的話 人們就沒有房子住了 也沒有工作做了
if we're right, people lose homes. People lose jobs.
沒有退休基金了 也沒有養老金了
People lose retirement savings. People lose pensions.
你們知道我最恨銀行業什麼嗎
You know what I hate about fucking banking?
它把人當成數字看待 告訴你們一個數字
It reduces people to numbers. Here's a number.
失業率每上升百分之一
Every 1% unemployment goes up,
就會有四萬人死亡 你們知不知道
40,000 people die. Did you know that?
-不知道 -你們知不知道
- No. -Did you know that?
不 我不知道
No, I didn't know that.
我們剛才只是有點興奮
We were just excited.
別再跳舞了
Just don't fucking dance.
-好吧 -你要去哪
All right. Where are you going?
我心裏有點發毛了
Whoa, I just got really scared.
首先 今天表現不錯
First of all, great show today.
-你們表現很好 -謝謝您
- You were terrific. -Thank you.
你的大嘴巴簡直有如神助
Your big mouth was a revelation.
感激不盡
I appreciate that.
你們不是擔心有黑幕嗎
You worried you and your swaps are getting played?
這是個好機會
Well, this is an opportunity
你們可以見見自己賭博的對家
for you to meet who you're betting against.
盡量別太正義感爆棚 好好聽人家說話
Try not to get too righteous and listen a little.
好 好的 這人是誰
Okay, fine. Who is this guy?
一個大寫的混蛋
A real solid-gold asshole.
我是CDO經理
I'm a CDO manager.
還有這個職位
A "CDO manager"?
對 就職於哈丁顧問公司
Yeah, at Harding Advisors.
我都不知道CDO還需要管理
I didn't realize that there was anything to manage with CDOs.
不奇怪
Oh.
我們挑選可以進入CDO投資組合的證券
We select the securities that go into the CDO portfolio
並監控這些資產
and monitor the assets.
我負責美林的CDO業務
I do most of Merrill Lynch's CDOs.
你是給投資人代理還是給美林代理
Do you represent the investors or Merrill Lynch?
投資人
The investors.
這樣
You do.
-對 -但是
- Yeah. -But...
美林才不會給你介紹客戶
Merrill Lynch isn't gonna send you any customers
除非你把美林的債券放進投資組合裏
unless you put Merrill Lynch's bonds in your CDO.
好問題 這麼說吧 我和美林 嗯
Good question. Let's just say Merrill and I have, um...
我們關係很好
We have a good relationship.
你跟美林關繫好
You have a good relationship with Merrill Lynch.
我們合作很久了
We've been doing business together for a long time.
那你們創造的CDO
And so the CDOs that you create
是質量最好 價值最高的
are of the highest quality and the highest value.
-十分正確 嗯 -十分正確
- Absolutely. Yep. -Absolutely.
你們難道不擔心現在違約率上升這件事嗎
Are you at all concerned about the rising default rates?
我個人不覺得這些產品有什麼風險 馬克
I assume no risk for these products myself, Mark.
好吧
Okay.
那我來捋一捋 銀行打給你
So let me get this straight. The bank calls you up.
他們給你他們想賣的債券
They give you the bonds they want to sell.
他們給你客戶
They give you clients,
他們給你做買賣的錢
they give you money to run your business.
還為此付給你高額報酬
Give you fat fees for doing so.
但你說你是給投資人做代理的
But you represent the investors?
對不對
Is that right?
對
Yeah.
但是我們不在美林大廈裏辦公
But we're not in the Merrill Lynch building.
-好吧 你們在哪 -我們在新澤西
- Okay. Where are you? -We're in New Jersey.
你們離得有二十分鐘路程遠
You're 20 minutes away.
呵呵 要是坐直升飛機只需五分鐘哦
Well, five if you use a helicopter.
有意思吧 嗯
That's funny, huh?
真是太有趣了
That's hilarious.
哦 夥計
Oh, boy.
你上司要氣炸了
Your boss is about to explode.
才不會 看他興致勃勃的哪會炸
No, he's too curious to explode.
等等 再說一遍
Hold on. Say that again.
兩種CDO A包含B的一部分
CDO "A" Has parts of CDO"B"
同時B也包含A的一部分
And CDO "B" Has parts of CDO"A"
然後AB都被放到C裏面
But then they both get put inside CDO"C"
對 最後這個叫CDO的平方
Yeah, that one's called CDO squared.
也CDO的CDO
A CDO of a CDO.
懂了沒
All right?
還有的CDO是你掉期
And then there's CDOs made up of the opposite side
押注的對家組成的
of the bet you made with your swaps.
我們叫這種為合成CDO
We call them synthetic CDOs.
你說什麼 合成CDO
What did you say? Synthetic CDOs.
這特麼的太瘋了
That is fucking crazy.
才不瘋 這超賺錢
It's not. It's awesome.
他的臉都要氣熟了
His face is starting to boil.
他看上去就像電影《沙丘》裏面的壞蛋
He looks like the bad guy from Dune.
好吧 假如說
All right, let's say
你有五千萬美元的次級貸資金
you have a pool of $50 million in subprime loans.
那賭在這份資金上的錢有多少
How much money could be out there betting on it,
在你的合成CDO和掉期的
in your synthetic CDOs and swaps
就現在 按今晚的行情
right now, tonight?
我看看 五十萬美元
Let's see, $50 million... Hmm...
十億美元
A billion dollars.
什麼
What?
如果邁克爾·貝利發現的房貸證券
If the mortgage bonds that Michael Burry discovered
是火柴的話
were the match...
房貸市場衍生出的證券規模比真實的房貸市場
How much bigger is the market for insuring mortgage bonds
大多少
than actual mortgages?
二十倍吧
About 20 times.
如果房貸證券是火柴
If the mortgage bonds were the match
那麼CDO就是被煤油浸透的抹布
and the CDOs were the kerosene-soaked rags,
合成CDO就是原子彈
then the synthetic CDO was the atomic bomb
而原子彈的引爆按鈕正在醉酒總統的指頭底下
with the drunk President holding his finger over the button.
正是那一刻 在那蠢透的餐廳
It was at that moment in that dumb restaurant
一臉懵逼的馬克·包穆意識到
with that stupid look on his face that Mark Baum realized
全球經濟正面臨著崩潰的危險
that the whole world economy might collapse.
我知道你在想什麼
And I know what you're thinking.
合成CDO又是個什麼鬼
"What the fuck is a synthetic CDO?"
好吧 就讓理查德·薩勒 行為經濟學之父
Well, here's Dr. Richard Thaler, father of behavioral economics
和薩琳娜·戈麥斯來解釋一下
and Selena Gomez to explain.
好的 合成CDO是這樣運作的
Okay. So here's how a synthetic CDO works.
假如我現在在二十一點牌中 賭一千萬在這手牌上
Let's say I bet $10 million on a blackjack hand.
之所以說一千萬美元一手牌是因為一千萬美元代表著
$10 million because this hand is meant to represent
一個房貸證券的規模
a single mortgage bond.
好的 賽琳娜這牌面不錯 兩張明牌十八點
Okay, Selena has a pretty good hand here, showing 18.
莊家一張七點
Dealer showing seven.
賽琳娜的運氣是真的好
That's a really good hand for Selena.
贏面很大 事實上 她這手牌贏的概率
Good odds. In fact, her chances of winning
概率有百分之八十七
this hand are 87%.
好的 我的贏面不錯 而且我已經在連贏了
So, my odds are good. I'm on a winning streak.
在場的所有人都蠢蠢欲動想跟賭
Everybody in this place wants to get in on the action.
我怎麼可能會輸呢 不是麼
How could I lose, right?
其實這是一個很常見的錯誤
Now, this is a classic error.
用籃球術語的話這叫熱手謬誤
In basketball it's called the Hot Hand Fallacy.
當選手連續投中多球之後
A player makes a bunch of shots in a row.
人們會肯定下一個他們還能投中
People are sure they're gonna make the next one.
人們認為現在在發生的任何事
People think that whatevefs happening now
都會持續到將來
is gonna continue to happen into the future.
在房產大熱期 房價不停地漲
During the real estate boom, markets were going up and up
人們覺得房價永遠不會跌下來
and people thought they would never go down.
所以那些覺得我不會輸的圍觀群眾
So people who are watching and think that I won't lose
就會下個賭注
will make a side bet.
現在 這是第一個合成CDO
Now, this is the first synthetic CDO.
我愛塞麗娜·戈麥斯
I love Selena Gomez.
我跟你賭五千萬美元她贏
I bet you $50 million she wins.
我給你三比一的賠率
And I'll give you 3-to-1 odds.
三比一的賠率 好 我賭
3-to-1 odds? Okay, I'll take that bet.
現在 還有別人想跟賭
Now, somebody else is gonna want to make a bet
賭剛剛他們賭注的結果
on the outcome of their bet.
我跟你賭五千萬她贏
Bet you 50 million she wins.
這就是合成CDO二號
That will lead to synthetic CDO number two.
嘿 我跟你賭兩億美元那個戴眼鏡的女士
Hey, I bet you $200 million that lady in the glasses
會賭贏
wins that bet.
她很可能會贏 所以我要高賠率
She probably will win. So I want a great payoff.
二十比一如何
How about 20-to-1?
成交
Deal.
這會一直持續下去並產生更多的合成CDO
And this will go on and on with more and more synthetic CDOs.
我們就能把開始的一百萬美元的投資
And we can transform an original $10 million investment
變成數十億的賭注
into billions of dollars.
你還好嗎
You Okay?
不好
No.
實際上我覺得很噁心
I actually feel pretty sick.
我要走了
So I'm going to leave.
你覺得我是寄生蟲 是嗎 包穆先生
You think I'm a parasite, don't you, Mr. Baum?
但是 很顯然 這個社會很待見我這樣的人
But, apparently, society values me very much.
要不這麼辦吧
In fact, let's do this.
我告訴你我身價多少
I'll tell you how much I'm worth.
你再告訴我你身價多少
You tell me how much you're worth.
天啊 你簡直是一坨臭到不可思議的大熱翔
God, you are an incredibly big piece of shit.
賣空那傢伙做過的任何債券
Short everything that guy has touched.
再多投五億到掉期上
I want half a billion more in swaps.
你確定嗎 那麼多擔保催繳可能會讓你破產的
You sure about that? The collateral calls could bankrupt you.
確定確定
Yeah. Yeah.
你要去哪兒
Where are you going?
我要去輪盤賭桌那兒
I am going to try to find moral redemption
挽救一下三觀
at the roulette table.
嘿嘿嘿
Hey, hey, hey!
事情比我想的更糟
Things are worse than I thought.
我真的覺得這回經濟可能要崩潰了
I honestly think the economy might collapse.
但是你說這個金融系統崩壞
But you've been saying
已經說了很多年了 馬克 所以
that the system's broken for years, Mark. So...
為什麼現在你這麼震驚
Why are you so shocked?
這比我想像的扭曲多了
It's more twisted than I could have imagined.
你愛做那個道德高尚的人
You love to be the virtuous one.
我是個銀行家 我也是這其中的一員
I'm a banker. I'm a part of it.
你總是這樣 馬克 好像你不想被染髒一樣
You always have, Mark. Like you're untainted.
這行改變了我 它讓我變成了一個
It changed me. It changed me into a person
無法和別人交心的人
who is not able to reach out to someone...
他很痛苦 我兄弟當時真的很痛苦
He was in pain. My brother was in real pain.
並沒有一個完美的方法去幫助他
There's no perfect way to help.
這很悲傷 很恐怖
It's sad. It's scary.
所以別總在試著拯救世界了
So stop trying to fix the world.
他告訴我
He told me...
你不是聖人
You're not a saint.
聖人不會住在派克大街上
Saints don't live on Park Avenue.
他有一些不好的想法
...that he was having bad thoughts.
你得接受這些感覺 就像我們這樣
Just feel the feelings like the rest of us.
我的第一個反應是給他錢
My first response was to offer him some money.
我特麼的只會給他錢
I offered him fucking money!
他的臉摔得稀爛
His face was so smashed.
好的
That's right.
邁克爾
Michael?
-邁克爾 -我在 我在
- Michael? -Yes. Yes.
-一切還好嗎 -還好寶貝兒
- Is everything okay? -Yes, honey.
-你確定 -我確定
- You sure? -Yeah, baby.
我還好
I'm fine.
致所有的投資者們
To all investors.
你們應該知道
As you may know,
我們的協議允許我在市場運行不正常的時候
our agreement allows me to take extraordinary measures
採取極端手段
when markets aren't functioning properly.
現在我有理由相信房貸證券市場
I currently have reason to believe the mortgage bond market
是場騙局
is fraudulent.
所以 為了保護投資者不受欺詐市場的損害
So, in order to protect investors from this fraudulent market,
我決定直到我後續通知為止
I've decided to restrict investors' withdrawals
任何投資者不得撤資
until further notice.

我根本不可能猜到
I never would have guessed my life
搬到洛杉磯後我的生活會發生這麼大的變化
could change as much as it has since I moved to L.A.
不見你並不是
It's not just,
並不是什麼很簡單的事

Will you please stop changing the channels?

大銀行不可能那麼蠢
that the big banks are that stupid.
再見 凱西
Bye. Kathy!
怎麼樣
Well?
凱西覺得賣掉我們做空的掉期
Kathy thinks that it would be a good idea
會是個不錯的注意
if we sold our shorts.
還有呢
What else is new?
她還說摩根士丹利會買下它們
And she said that Morgan Stanley will buy them.
誒媽呀
Holy shit!
你怎麼說
What did you say?
我說我們屁都不會賣
I told her we're not selling shit.
額 如果你需要2005年的文件的話
Uh, if you need the files for 2005...
菲爾德先生的訴訟只要求去年到現在的資料
Mr. Fields' suit is very specific to files from the past year.
好 那出去吧 幫我給勞倫斯打聲招呼
Good. Then get out. Say hi to Lawrence for me.
我會的
Will do.
你一周都不能給我回電話
You can't call me back for a week?
我很抱歉 麥克
I am so sorry, Mike.
高盛的系統崩了 我丟失了很多信息
Goldman had a systems failure. I lost a ton of messages.
對 美國銀行說它們停電了
Yeah, B of A said they had a power outage,
摩根士丹利說他們服務器崩潰了
and Morgan Stanley said their server crashed.
這麼湊巧
Huh. That's weird.
呵 我覺得這不可能
Well, I would call it improbable.
所以我們現在頭寸的估價多少
So where do you have our position marked?
還是沒變 麥克
I think it's the same, Mike.
什麼 你能不能解釋一下給我聽
What? Can you explain that to me, please,
如果被保的東西都毀了 保險合同還不能起效
because how can the value of an insurance contract
那還要保險何用
not be affected by the demise of the very thing it insures?
它們是各自獨立的市場 並沒有總是互相關聯
They're independent markets. They're not always correlated.
我知道這聽起來很奇怪
I know it sounds odd,
但它們是非常複雜的金融產品
but these are very complicated products.
它們是相關聯的
They are correlated.
人們會失去房子 失去工作
They're gonna lose their houses, they're gonna lose theirjobs,
他們會失去
they're gonna lose their...
你在聽我說嗎
Will you listen to me?
這就像是資本主義的終結一樣
This is like the end of capitalism.
就像是黑暗時代再次降臨
This is like the Dark Ages all over again.
我不想和我爸說
I don't want to talk to Dad.
好的 我也愛你 存好你的錢
Okay, I love you, too. Save your money.
她說我得去開抗焦慮的藥 治抑鬱藥劑量得加倍
She says I need to be on Xanax and double my dose of Zoloft.
我叫貝爾斯登估下我們做空掉期的價格
I asked Bear Stearns to price our shorts.
他們告訴我CDO的價格還是沒變
They tell me the CDOs still haven't moved.
這群人簡直喪心病狂
This is fucking insane!
你懂嗎 這些人都是騙子
You realize that? These people are crooks
他們應該去坐牢
and they should be in prison.
你看看次貸衍生債券綜合指數
Look at the ABX.
CDO已經一文不值了啊
You can see that the CDOs are worth zero!
你知道他們在幹什麼吧
So you know what they're doing, huh?
你知道他們在幹什麼對吧
You know what they're doing, right?
嗯 他們在拋售債券
Yeah. They're unloading them.
他們在拋售自己的狗屎CDO 然後他們去別的銀行
They're selling their dog shit CDOs, then they go to another bank
做空那些他們剛賣出的狗屎債券
and short the shit they just fucking sold!
哥們 咱們得去找媒體
Let's go to the press, man!
這可是重大爆料 誰不會登啊
This is a massive story. Who wouldn't publish it?
像羅伯特·雷德佛特那樣
Robert Redford!
不 你不懂
No, you don't understand!
我懂 夥計們 我懂
I got it, guys. I got it.
但我該做什麼呢
What am I supposed to do?
你們想讓我寫一篇題為「我們都玩完了」的稿子嗎
Do you want me to write a piece called "We're All Fucked"?
行啊 這是個完美的標題
Yes! That's a perfect title!
凱西 現在城內所有的銀行都在向不知情的客戶
Casey, right now every bank in town is unloading these shit bonds
拋售這些狗屎證券
onto unsuspecting customers.
而且銀行在賣掉它們之前是不會降價的
And they won't devalue them until they get them off their books.
這種程度的犯罪行為哪怕在見鬼的華爾街
This level of criminality is unprecedented,
都是史無前例的啊
even on fucking Wall Street.
傑米 我老實跟你說
Jamie... And this is me being honest here, okay?
我花了很多年才建立起在華爾街的人際網
It took me years to build my relationships on Wall Street.
沒有銀行或者評級機構會承認這樣的事情
No bank or ratings agency is going to confirm a story like this
更何況說這話的是兩個在
just because it comes from two guys in a...
抱歉 在車庫裏搞對沖基金的傢伙覺得世界末日要來了
Sorry, garage band hedge fund that thinks it's the apocalypse.
哇哦
Wow.
凱西 我以前覺得你是個良心記者
I thought you were for real, Casey.
我必須得承認我以前真這麼覺得
You know, I'll have to say I really did.
真的嗎
Really?
傑米 你試試看 在有個三歲孩子
Yeah, Jamie, you try being for real with a three-year-old
和讀碩士的老婆的情況下 做個良心記者
and a wife getting her master's degree.
我不會為了你們的瞎想就去毀掉我的名聲
I'm not gonna burn my reputation on your wild hunch.
哇哦
Wow.
哇哦
Wow.
夥計們 感謝來訪
Thanks for coming, guys.
見到你們真的很開心
Totally fucking awesome to see you.
是啊 凱西 我一直都討厭你
Yeah, Casey. I've always hated you,
因為你大學的時候就是個混蛋
because you were a prick in college
結果你今天還是個混蛋
and you are a prick today!
多謝 查理 還和你媽住一起呢
Thanks, Charlie. Still living with your mom?
查理 走了
Charlie, come on!
這裏還是馬克·包穆 回電話
Mark Baum again. Call me.
次貸證券跌入谷底
Subprime bonds fell off a cliff.
傳言說倒債數額巨大
Rumor has it the default numbers are huge.
誰先拿到了匯款數據 我賭是高盛
Who got the remittance data early? I bet it's Goldman.
還真多謝你的幫忙
Yeah, fuck you very much.
傑瑞德 我這兒簡直一團糟 我們怎麼樣
Jared, it's chaos down here. Where are we?
「凱撒哭了 因世上再沒有讓他征服之處」
"And Caesar wept, for there were no more worlds to conquer."
夏恩
Shane?
夏恩
Shane?
好了 沒有人買CDO或者房貸證券了
Well, nobody's buying CDO or mortgage bonds anymore
所有人都想要買掉期
and everybody wants swaps.
掉期現在是整條華爾街上最受歡迎的產品
Swaps are now the most popular product on the street.
-這對我們來說是好消息吧 -是又不是
- That's good for us. -Yes and no.
我聽人從別人那裏聽說
I heard from somebody who heard from somebody...
不行 阿歷克斯 不行 抱歉
No, Alex, no. Sorry.
摩根證券部的本尼·克裏格爾
Bennie Cleager over at Morgan is taking on
損失相當慘重
some heavy losses in the bond department.
你的船可能在漏水
Your ship might be taking on water.
大家都等著穿我們的救生衣跑路呢
It might be time to get our lifejacket and get out.
我真是硬
I'm jacked.
全身都硬 硬到乳頭了
I'm jacked! I'm jacked to the tits!
你真棒
Good.
-你感覺到了嗎 -沒
- Do you feel it? - No.
你聽到什麼了 湯米
What'd you hear, Tommy?
開始了
It's happening
所有人都想要我們的掉期
Everybody wants our swaps.
凱西在找你
Kathy's office is looking for you.
現在他們又對我們唱好調了不是麼
They're singing a different tune now, aren't they?
情況不妙啊
That's not good.
以後再說 現在不行
Maybe later. Not now.
你在說笑吧
This is a joke.
喂
Listening.
-貝利博士 -是我
Dr. Burry? - Yeah.
我是迪波·溫斯頓 高盛的
Deeb Winston, Goldman Sachs.
我重看了下你的價位
Listen, I've been reviewing your position.
我想和你聊聊估價 來確保它們是公平的
I wanted to discuss your marks and make sure they're fair.
我想你的意思是
Yeah, I think you mean that you've
你已經做空了自己的倉位
secured a net short position yourselves.
所以你現在終於可以認真評估我掉期的價值了
So you're free to mark my swaps accurately for once
因為現在這麼做對你們也有好處
because it's now in your interest to do so.
我不知道你想要我說什麼
I'm not sure what you want me to say.
我想
I think that...
我想你已經說過了
I think that you've already said it.
你告訴高盛的傑夫我不會轉移基金的
You tell Jeff at Goldman that I'm not transferring funds.
這太扯淡了
This is bullshit!
好的 我們一會兒談
Okay, we'll talk later.
謝謝你
Thank you.
馬克 多謝你這麼快就來
Thanks for coming so quickly, Mark.
-是啊 -額
- Yeah. -Um...
我知道你聽說了
I know you've been hearing rumblings
有關摩根正在遭受損失的流言
about some losses Morgan has suffered.
-恭喜 -恭喜什麼
- Congratulations. -On what?
哦
Oh.
多謝 額
Thanks. Urn...
感覺好嗎
Having fun?
好
Yes.
非常好 額
Tons. Urn...
我只是想讓你知道 額
I just wanted you to know that, um...
沒錯 摩根是遭受了一些損失
That, yes, Morgan has suffered some losses,
但我們的流動資金很充足所以我們沒有理由去擔心
but our liquidity is strong and there's no cause for concern.
那需要擔心本尼·克裏格爾嗎
Would Bennie Cleager be concerned?
因為傳言說
Because word on the street
他損失很慘重
is that he took some pretty heavy losses.
凱茜 拜託 我們認識都多少年了
Kathy, come on. We know each other.
到底怎麼了
What's going on?
情況有多慘
How bad is this?
好吧
Okay.
兩年前 證券部的本尼·克裏格爾
Two years ago, Bennie Cleager in Morgan's bond department
也開始做空次級房貸 二十億做空三B級
also started shorting subprime housing, $2 billion in BBBs.
本尼比我想像的要聰明啊
Bennie is smarter than I thought.
不 他一點也不聰明
No, he's not smart at all.
掉期的保費吃空了他的利潤
The premiums on the swap ate into his desk's profit.
為了掩蓋他三B級的做空
To cover his BBB shorts,
他賣了很多A級和AA級的掉期作為保護
he sold a lot of A and AA swaps as protection.
很多
A lot.
他堅信A級和2A級不可能出事
He believed that there was no way that they could be affected.
別告訴我賣給我們這些掉期的正是摩根士丹利
Tell me Morgan Stanley doesn't hold the contracts on these swaps.
見鬼了
Holy shit.
這麼長時間以來
All this time I've been
我一直在試著弄明白我在跟誰賭
trying to figure out who I'm betting against,
結果是摩根士丹利
and it's Morgan Stanley.
就是我自己的公司
Which is me.
你風險敞口是多少 三十億
What's your exposure? $3 billion?
拜託 別告訴我超過四十億
Please, don't tell me it's more than four.
我不能回答你 我不能會回答你
I can't answer that. I can't answer that.
不 你能 因為我走進這裏的時候
Yes, you can answer that, because I walk in here
人們都在你的走廊上哭
and people are crying in your hallway.
凱茜
Kathy.
你叫我來這告訴我一切都好
You bring me in to tell me everything's fine,
但一切根本就不好
and everything's not fine.
到底怎麼了
What, what is happening?
現在多頭敞口是
The long exposure is...
一百五十億
...$15 billion.
上帝啊
Jesus!
他一直說百分之八以上的違約率是不可能的
He kept saying defaults over 8% were impossible.
哦天啊
Oh, my God.
數以百萬的人會流離失所
That there would be a million homeless!
我們和摩根士丹利沒有關係
Yeah, but we have nothing to do with Morgan Stanley.
是啊
Yeah...
你去這麼和破產法庭說
Tell the bankruptcy court.
摩根倒閉了 我們的戶頭也都會轉到他們的資產負債表上
Morgan fails, all our accounts go on their balance sheet.
這太瘋狂了
It's just crazy.
摩根下了個爛賭
Morgan makes the sucker's bet
我們卻要幫他們賠
and we pay their fucking gambling debt?
做空銀行股票 然後我們等
Short the bank stocks. Then we wait.
或者市場一開始交易我們就賣掉我們的掉期
Or we sell our swaps when the market opens.
我們拿到獎金 投資者們拿到收益
We get our bonuses, our investors get their profits, we get...
一美元賺30美分 還不錯
What, 30 cents on the dollar. It's not bad.
我們比這值三倍
We're three times that.
如果沒市場賣出去的話就沒戲了
Not if there's no market left to sell them in.
不 我們不能把救生船給這些人
Forget it. We're not giving out any lifeboats.
如果摩根破產 那我們什麼都得不到
If Morgan goes under, we end up with nothing.
維尼
Vinnie.
別這樣 我說賣的時候再賣
Jesus, come on. I say when we sell.
聽著 我知道這對你來說是私人恩怨
Look, I get that this is personal for you,
但我們對投資人也要責任
but we have a fiduciary responsibility.
不 不需要
No. No, we don't.
沒人要負責
Nobody's acting responsible.
去他的責任 你在開玩笑嗎
Fuck responsibility. Are you kidding me?
大銀行那些混蛋們
The assholes at the big banks will take...
你們要什麼開胃菜嗎
You boys want any appetizers?
拜託 我們在說話
We're talking, please!
-不要打擾我們 -抱歉
- Excuse us. -Sorry.
我們要等 一直等
We are going to wait, and we are going to wait,
耐心地等下去
and we are going to wait
直到他們感到痛苦 直到他們流血
until they feel the pain, until they start to bleed.
-那就是我的目的 -那我們的客戶呢
- That is what I want. -But what about our clients
他們把存款信託給我們
who've entrusted us with their savings...
什麼時候賣我說了算
I say when we sell.
這和你的私人恩怨沒關係
This isn't about you.
這也和你在上東區的
This isn't about you and your Upper East Side
-街頭演說無關 -嘿
-mahogany soapbox. -Hey! Hey!
什麼時候賣我說了算
I say when we sell!
隨便你吧 馬克
Whatever you say, Mark.
兄弟 聽說新聞了嗎
Dude, did you hear the news?
貝爾斯登買的兩份
Okay. So, not only do two mortgage hedge funds
房貸對沖基金不僅破產
backed by Bear Stearns go belly up,
現在貝爾斯登也遭到了集體起訴
but now there's a class-action lawsuit against Bear.
我的天吶
Holy shit!
加油 快點 快點
Let's go! Push! Push!
貝爾斯登要完了嗎
So, what? Bear could really collapse here.
-我們不該冒這個險 -那怎麼辦
- This is a risk we really shouldn't take. - Then what?
我們在貝爾斯登買了80%的掉期
We bought 80% of our swaps at Bear.
-我們會一無所有 -那怎麼辦
- We 'd lose everything. - So what?
-嘿 先生 -馬上
- Hey, sir? -One second!
那是我的看法
That's my opinion.
我們買了這些鬼東西
We bought these fucking things.
卻不知道怎麼賣出去
We have no clue how to sell them.
我知道 我們得找本幫忙
I know. We have to get Ben to do it.
我一直在給他打電話 但他沒有回復
I've been trying to call him and he won't get back to me.
他在和他妻子一家度假
No. He's on vacation with his wife's family.
他們在英國
They're in England.
什麼
What?
-嗨 本 -夥計們
Hello, Ben. Hey. BEN: Guys?
能聽見我們說話嗎
Yeah, we're here. Can you hear us?
-夥計們 -恩 聽到了
- Guys? -  Yeah, we got you.
恩 我沒帶手機 這裏也沒有WiFi
Yeah. I hardly got cell phone or Wi-Fi service.
我竟然在酒吧裏賣出價值2億美元的證券
I'm trying to sell $200 million worth of securities.
真是膽戰心驚
In a pub. It smells like sheep.
你能做到的
You can do this.
我不想給你壓力 本
I don't want to pressure you, Ben
但如果你不能解決的話 我們就什麼都沒了
but if you don't pull this off, we lose everything.
看看瑞士信貸的興趣如何
All right. Let's see what Credit Suisse's appetite is.
這裏是棕地基金
This is Brownfield Fund.
我想拋售我的信用違約掉期
I want to unload my credit default swaps.
好的 你有些什麼
All right. What you got?
20筆2A級的CDO
Twenty AA tranches of A.B.S. CDOs.
但這些CDO很糟糕
A.B.S. ? Are these... These are pretty bad.
當然 糟透了
Absolutely. They're complete shit.
名義價值是多少
What's your notional value?
面值2億5百萬美元
Face value is 205 million. Dollars.
好吧 那我們出價4千萬
All right, we could, we could go to forty.
不 我們至少要1億
No. We want at least 100 million.
1億 你是誰啊 毒販還是銀行家
100 million? Who are you, a drug dealer or a banker?
如果你是銀行家的話 你可以滾蛋了
'Cause if you're a banker, you can fuck right off!
我不知道是否有市場
I don't know if we can make a market.
最低出價多少
Just give me your best price?
呵呵 一億還嫌不夠 夥計
Yeah. Chuck 100 million in for me, mate.
我想我們的價格相差甚遠
I think we're far apart.
如果你不想做這筆交易 可以直接掛電話
Look, if you don't want the deal, you can just hang up.
這是我的看法
That's what I thought.
-9千萬 -7千萬
-90 million. -70.
8千5百萬
-7千8白萬 -8千4百萬
-78 -84.
我是巴裏博士
It's Dr. Burry.
貌似金融業就要垮台了
Looks like the collapse of the financial sector is imminent.
我要賣出期貨
Let's start to sell my position.
一共13億美元
It's $1.3 billion.
當然 我等著
Sure, I'll hold.
我說對了
So, I was right.
我苦苦忍受了兩年
I took a rash of shit for two years, but
但我是對的
I was right.
其他人都錯了
And everyone was wrong.
是的 我拿到了獎金支票 告我啊
And, yeah, I got a bonus check for it. Sue me.
你知道麼
You know?
我拿到了很多錢 我能感覺到你在審判我
It's a lot of money. I get it. I can feel you judging me.
那是很明顯的
That's palpable.
但我從沒說過我是這個故事裏的英雄
But, hey, I never said I was the hero of this story.
嘿 本 情況怎麼樣
Hey, Ben. How are we looking?
八
Eight...on...
什麼
Sorry?

No. Eighty million.

大多數賣給了瑞士聯合銀行
Most of it went to UBS.
你們很走運
You're very lucky. The largest bank
法國最大的銀行今天凍結了客戶的貨幣市場賬戶
in France froze customer's money market accounts today.
這事兒影響到歐洲了
This thing's hitting Europe.
希臘和冰島已經完了
Greece and Iceland are finished.
西班牙還在掙扎
Spain is teetering.
你說真的嗎 我去

額
Uh...
你為什麼要幫我們
Why did you do this with us?
你沒這個必要的
You didn't have to. Uh...
當然我們很謝謝你 但是為什麼呢
Thank you. But, uh, why?
你們說你們想發大財 現在你們發財了
You guys said you wanted to get rich. Now you're rich.
進了
Goal!
潘普洛納得分
Pamplona puts themselves on the scoreboard.
隨著住房市場和銀行持續萎靡
As the housing markets and banks continued to hemorrhage,
只有一個大空頭沒有賣出債券
only one of the big shorts refused to sell.
那就是馬克·鮑姆
Mark Baum.
因此當他受邀在會議上
So it was beyond perfect when he was asked to speak
發表反對布魯斯·米勒的演講時 這一切都太完美了
at a conference opposite Bruce Miller,
布魯斯·米勒是位著名的樂觀投資人
the famous bullish investor.
艾倫·格林斯潘 也就是這場危機的導火索之一
After he and Mark had their debate, Alan Greenspan,
預計在布魯斯和米勒辯論完之後發表演講
one of the architects of the whole crisis was scheduled to speak.
馬克辦公室的每個人都來了 他甚至還請來了朋友
Everyone in Mark's office showed up, he even invited friends.
這就像是阿里和福爾曼的金融世紀對決
This was the Ali vs. Foreman of the financial world.
現實主義者和傻瓜的較量
The realist versus the fools.
如果這些看起來完美得不真實 相信我 這些的確發生過
And if it seems almost too perfect, trust me, this happened.
歡迎到場的各位 請大家熱烈歡迎
Welcome, everyone. Please give a generous welcome to
布魯斯·米勒和馬克·鮑姆先生
Mr. Bruce Miller and Mark Baum.
沉住氣啊
Strap yourself in.
也許你們已經知道了
So as some of you may know, Bear Steams
貝爾斯登公司剛剛收到了摩根大通的貸款
has just received a loan from JP Morgan.
當然我們要等待
Of course, we're gonna
看市場如何反應
have to wait and see how the markets react,
但那應該會平息一些對銀行經濟狀況的焦慮
but that should lay to rest any concerns about the bank's health.
那麼可以認為
Now, I take it you have no
你不打算賣出你在貝爾斯登2千萬的股票了
plans to sell your $200 million in Bear stock?
不 其實在這裏講完之後
No. As a matter of fact, when we're done here,
我也許還會去再買一些
I'll probably go out and buy some more.
鮑姆先生 你的反對意見是
For the opposing view, Mr. Baum.
我得站起來說話
I got to stand for this.
大家好
Okay, hi.
我公司的理念很簡單
My firm's thesis is pretty simple.
華爾街把劉易斯創始的
Wall Street took a good idea,
房貸證券的好點子
Lewis Ranieri's mortgage bond,
變成了即將摧毀
and turned it into an atomic bomb
世界經濟的原子彈
of fraud and stupidity
這一切充滿了欺詐 失去了理智
that's on its way to decimating the world economy.
說得好像真的一樣耶
How do you really feel?
很高興你們還有幽默感
I'm glad you still have a sense of humor.
如果我是你們 我不會笑的
I wouldn't if I were you.
瞭解我的人都知道
Now, anyone who knows me knows that
我可以毫無顧忌地指出別人的錯誤
I have no problem telling someone they're wrong.
貝爾斯登在否認關於流動資金的傳言
Bear Stearns is denying rumors of liquidity problems.
我去 39了
Holy fuck, it's 39 now!
如今我們生活在一個欺詐的時代
We live in an era of fraud in America.
不僅僅是銀行業 還有政府
Not just in banking, but in government,
教育 宗教 食品
education, religion, food,
甚至還有棒球
even baseball.
讓我困擾的不是
What bothers me isn't that
欺詐不光彩 或者欺詐很卑鄙
fraud is not nice or that fraud is mean.
而是1萬5千年以來
It's that for 15,000 years
欺詐和目光短淺
fraud and short-sighted thinking
從未有過立足之處
have never, ever worked.
-天吶 貝爾斯登到降到37了 -一次也沒有
Jesus, Bear at 37... -Not once.
人們最終都會露餡 然後一敗塗地
Eventually, people get caught, things go south.
在暴跌啊 夥計
It's fucking plummeting, man.
我們什麼時候把那全忘了
When the hell did we forget all that?
我以為我們能做得更好 真的
I thought we were better than this. I really did.
我們沒有做到的這一事實
And the fact that we're not
也沒有讓我感到一絲安心或者優越
doesn't make me feel all right and superior.
相反 我覺得很 悲哀
It makes me feel... Sad.
每次刷新後都在下降 夥計
Every time I fucking hit "Refresh" It's dropping, man.
看著自大愚蠢的華爾街人
And as fun as it is to watch
一錯再錯是件很有趣的事
pompous, dumb Wall Streeters be wildly wrong,
你也錯了 先生
and you are wrong, sir,
我知道這些風波過後
I just know, that at the end of the day
將是平民百姓
average people are going to be the ones
來為這一切買賬
that are gonna have to pay for all this.
因為遭殃的總是百姓
Because they always, always do.
降到32了
It's 32.
這是我的拙見 夥計
It's fucking tanked, man.
那是我的意見 謝謝各位
That's my two cents. Thank you.
我要去看看德意志銀行的
Let me drop a deuce at Deutsche.
反對方有什麼回應嗎
Does our bull have a response?
在華爾街整個歷史中
Only that, in the entire history of Wall Street,
沒有投資銀行失敗過
no investment bank has ever failed
除非他們觸犯了法律
unless caught in criminal activities.
因此 我仍對貝爾斯登公司持樂觀態度
So, yes, I stand by my Bear Stearns optimism.
米勒先生 抱歉 我問個小問題
Mr. Miller, I'm sorry. Quick question.
從你們說話的時候開始
From the time you guys started talking,
貝爾斯登公司的股票跌了38%
Bear Stearns stock has fallen more than 38%.
你還會繼續買嗎
Would you still buy more?
當然了 為什麼不呢
Yeah, sure, of course I'd buy more. Why not'?
打臉了吧
Boom.
我的天吶
Jesus Christ!
以上是我們辯論的第一輪
That concludes the first part of our presentation.
接下來 有請美聯儲前任主席
Up next, we have the legendary former chairman of the Fed,
傳奇人物艾倫·格林斯潘
Alan Greenspan.
各位
Folks?
這是雷曼兄弟銀行的僱員們
employees of Lehman Brothers today,
華爾街大銀行的股票暴跌至零
as the Wall Street giant's stock went to zero.
在幾個月的市場劇烈波幅
The collapse of the venerable New York bank
和世界經濟恐慌之後
follows a tumultuous few months of market volatility
脆弱的紐約銀行相繼破產
and fear in the world economy.
我要進去看看
I got to see inside.
怎麼進去
How?
來吧

最棒的金融機遇

賺錢不是我所想的那樣
Making money is not like I thought it would be.
這個行業抹殺了生活中重要的一部分
This business kills the part of life that is essential.
而這個部分和這個行業毫無關聯
The part that has nothing to do with business.
在過去兩年我一直覺得

我的內心在自我吞噬

我曾經尊重的所有人
All the people I respected
不再和我說話
won't talk to me anymore
他們只通過律師找我
except through lawyers.
人們
People
總想要一個權威來告訴他們怎麼選擇價值
want an authority to tell them how to value things...
但他們選擇的這個權威並沒有事實依據
...but they choose this authority not based on facts or results.
它只是看起來有威望 而且很熟悉 因此才選擇了它
They choose it because it seems authoritative and familiar.
而我沒有
And I am not
也從未對任何事物熟悉過
and never have been "Familiar".
因此

They knew.
自動取款機裏快沒錢了
Cash would've stopped coming out of ATMs.
他們不得不增援
They had to backstop this.
他們知道納稅人會給他們買賬
They knew the taxpayers would bail them out.
他們不是傻 他們只是不在乎
They weren't being stupid. They just didn't care.

The banks took the money the American people gave them
用來給自己付獎金

and lobby Congress to kill big reform.
然後他們怪罪於移民和窮人
And then they blamed immigrants and poor people.
這次甚至還怪罪於老師
And this time, even teachers.
這起風波過後
And when all was said and done,
只有一個銀行家落了馬
only one single banker went to jail.
這個可憐的笨蛋
This poor schmuck.
來自瑞士信貸的卡裏姆·塞拉蓋爾丁
Kareem Serageldin from Credit Suisse.
他隱瞞了數十億房貸證券損失
He hid a few billion in mortgage bond losses,
但這對危機期間的銀行來說

這些損失不足為奇
banks did on a good day during the crisis.
