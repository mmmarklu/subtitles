- Huh? Huh?
- You missed the race, Mama.
啊 我要集中注意力才行
Hmm. I wish I'd pay more attention.
Smithers 這啤酒不管用
Smithers, this beer isn't working.
我沒感覺變更瀟洒倜儻
I don't feel any younger or funkier.

慢點
Slow down.
太棒了
Excellent.
新出的泡沫手大的有點离譜了
This novelty foam hand
is ludicrously oversized.
換一個小點的來
Go swap it for a smaller one.
确實有點夸張
我馬上回來
It is a bit ostentatious, sir.
I'll be right back.
嘿 Burnsie
今晚聚會很棒呀
Hey, Burnsie!
This was some swell shindig.

I had a great time.
I just wanna shake your hand.

Doesn't seem as funny to me.
But what do I know?
Smithers
Smithers.!
啊 天啊
Oh, my God!
嘿~嘿
Hey-hey!
Smithers
你應該看見他眼里閃爍著凶光吧
You should've seen the murderous glint
in his eyes, Smithers.
口气里全是椒鹽面包跟啤酒的味道
And his breath reeked of beer
and pretzled bread.
很抱歉 Burns先生
都是我的錯
I'm so sorry, Mr. Burns.
This was all my fault.
沒有 不要怪自己
No. Don't concern yourself.
如果情況真的很糟糕
我還有我的釘頭錘
If things had turned ugly,
I always had my mace.
請不要那么容易就原諒我  先生
Don't let me off the hook
that easily, sir.
我辜負了你
我永遠不能原諒自己
I failed you,
and I'll never forgive myself.
永遠不能 永遠不能 永遠不能
Never! Never! Never!
永遠不能 永遠不能 永遠不能 
Never! Never! Never!
永遠不能 永遠不能 永遠不能
Never! Never! Never!
早上好 為了彌補我昨晚的過錯
Good morning, sir. To make up
for my failure last night...
我已經幫您安排好早飯
I've alphabetized your breakfast.
您可以先吃華夫餅
然后吃烤面包
You can start with the waffles
and work your way up to the zwieback.
為了避免報紙弄脹你的手
And to prevent newsprint
from rubbing off on your hands...

I've laminated today's newspaper.
我很感謝你的周到
但是我的筆寫不上去 
I appreciate the thought,
but my pen won't write on this.
你叫我怎么做初級填字游戲
How am I supposed to do
the "JuniorJumble"?
噢 我連卑躬屈膝都不會
我是個廢人
Oh! I can't even grovel properly.
I'm a buffoon.
我活著還有什么意義
I don't deserve to live
on your planet anymore!
啊
Agh!
振作點
Pull yourself together, man.
我想你很需要一個假期
I daresay you're in need
of a long vacation.
不 不要 不要讓我放假
No! Don't make me take a vacation.
沒有你 我也活不成了
Without you, I'll wither and die!
- 我倒想冒冒這個險
- 沒有我您將如何
- That's a risk I'm willing to take.
- What would you do without me?
我又不是要保姆幫忙打嗝的嬰儿
I'm not a baby
who needs a nursemaid to burp me.
看見了吧
You see?
我堅持要你放假
Now, I insist you take a vacation...
赶快找人暫時替代你的工作就好
just as soon as a temporary substitute
can be found.
上帝啊
Sheesh.!
我得找個不比我出色的代班
I've got to find a replacement
who won't outshine me.
我或許該在員工評价里搜索
關鍵字"不能胜任"
Perhaps if I search the employee evaluations

我直接找Homer Simpson好了
Nuts to this.

我想Smithers選擇我
是因為我的激勵技巧
I think Smithers picked me
because of my motivational skills.
人們都說只要我在
他們的工作都會變得更辛苦
Everyone always says they have to work
a lot harder when I'm around.

I'm sure the manual will indicate
which lever is the velocitator...
哪個是減速的 是吧
and which the deceleratrix, hmm?
太神奇了
I can't believe it.

你為我做的比任何人都多
No, Homer. You've already
done more for me than any man.
你那無情的一拳把我打醒了
Your brutal attack forced me
to fend for myself.

你做的那些事情被解雇了
those things that... you do.

at any corporation he wants.
來見見你新的鋼琴搬運工

Where are you throwing me?

- I look forward to workin' with ya.
- Mr. Smithers! Wait!
你不能讓自己毀在這破地方 
你有兩個選擇
You can't let yourself end up in a place
like this. You've got two choices.
你可以自暴自棄
然后做這份保衛的工作
You can give up on yourself
and take the Barney-guarding job-
就像我們在低潮時期干的事情那樣
like so many of us have contemplated
in our darkest moments-
或者你可承認這世上只有一個能讓你高興...
or you can admit to yourself there's only
one person that can make you happy...
那就不惜代价拿回你的一切
and do whatever it takes
to get them back!
你說得對
You're right!
但我需要你的幫助
But I'm gonna need your help.
啊 我的天啊
Oh, my God!

Mr. Burns may have mastered
2,799 of my 2,800 duties...
我以甜甜圈的錢壓注...
but I'll wager dollars to doughnuts...
他還無法處理他媽媽的來電
he still can't handle
a call from his mother.
成交
You're on!
干嘛
What?

Montgomery, on the line.
那膚淺無知的蠢蛋
That improvident lackwit!
老因為在那破厂里踱步
沒空打電話給老娘
Always too busy stridin' about his atom mill
to call his own mother.
我讓他好看
I'll give him what for
till he cries brassafrax!
好极了
Perfect.
我給你信號的時候
你就把電話轉給Burns先生
When I give the signal,
you transfer the call to Mr. Burns.

Ooh! Is my face red.
Burns太太122歲了
你要把聲音變得更死气沉沉的
Mrs. Burns is 122 years old,

And she doesn't
call her son "Mr. Burns. "

Son, this is Mrs. Burns.
我只打來告訴你 我不愛你
I just called to say
I don't love you.

那么
So.
你會模仿我母親咯
Impersonate my mother, will you?

And you, Smithers,
you must have put him up to it.

You really blew it this time,
Smithers.

這時快絕滅的禿鷹衝入輸電線
Here comes the endangered condor
into the power lines.

小心點不要燙到您眼睛
Careful not to burn yourself
on his eye.
我并不需要你這么做

我完全可以自力更生
I'm totally self-reliant now.
盡管我想吃西班牙脆果
What I would like, though,
is a spanish peanut.
皮
Skin.
Mm-mmm-mmm!
你离開的這段時間 
發生了一件了不起的事情...
It's a remarkable thing.
In the short time you were gone...

self-reli- ant.
噢 至于那推我出窗的家伙...
Oh, and as for that brutish fellow
who knocked me out the window...
看他會有什么報應
see that he gets
what's coming to him.
我已經知道了
I already have, sir.
這是干嘛的
What'd you get that for?
把Burns先生從三樓推出窗外
For knocking Mr. Burns
out of a third-story window.
