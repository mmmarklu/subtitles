我的HBO專場第四站
to my fourth HBO Special.
是的沒錯
That's right, baby.
第四場! 耶!
Number four! Yeah!
嗯 這只是"殺死比爾"第一部
"殺死比爾"共兩部 兩部上映的間隔時間很長
Yeah, this is the Kill Bill one,
懂?
you know what I'm saying?
可不能演砸了啊
Gonna do it right, man.
很高興來到華盛頓特區
It's good to be here in Washington, DC.
特區哦
DC.
真不錯 富麗堂皇的憲法大廳
That's right. Lovely Constitution Hall,
沒錯
that's right, man.
我很久沒辦巡迴演出了
Now I haven't toured in a long time,
也很久沒開過專場了
I haven't done a special for a long time.
我期望能遇到點特別的事
I was waiting for special things to happen,
因為我上次巡演之後
and a lot's happened in my life
真是發生了不少事兒
since the last time I was on the road, man.
我有了女兒 一個小丫頭
I had a little baby girl, had a little baby girl.
一個小丫頭啊
Little baby girl.
這也沒啥
It's not a big deal.
就連蟑螂也生小孩 是吧? 
I mean, even roaches have kids, right?
但我生的是丫頭
But I got a little baby girl.
真太棒了 你一個男人
And it's amazing when you have a girl
有了自己的丫頭
you're a man and you have a girl,
感觸很深
it's eye-opening.
因為我意識到 我是她一生中最先接觸到的男人
Cos I realize I'm the man in her life.
我和我女兒的關係
And my relationship with my daughter
會影響到她在今後的人生中
is gonna affect her relationship with men
和其他男人的關係
for the rest of her life.
在座各位男士
And every man in here
肯定和一些有某父情結的妹子談過吧
has dated a woman with some daddy issues.
這事情不是鬧著玩兒的啊 是不是?
That shit ain't fun, OK?
她因為她老爸1969年做的那點破事兒
She giving you a hard time over some shit
害得你沒好日子過 有過沒?
her daddy did in 1969, OK?
不是鬧著玩兒的啊
That shit ain't never fun.
有時我和女兒散步 看她一搖一擺的
Sometimes I'm walking with my daughter,
我跟她說話
talking to my daughter,
看她小手推著嬰兒車
I'm looking at her pushing on her stroller,
有時候我把她抱起來 望著她
and sometimes I pick her up and stare at her
我想到 我一生唯一要做的...
and I realize my only job in life...
就是讓她離那根鋼管遠點 (暗指鋼管舞女)
is to keep her off the pole.
讓我寶貝兒離那根鋼管遠遠的!
Keep my baby off the pole!
我說雖然沒人爹評級
I mean they don't grade fathers
但你女兒要是跳脫衣舞的
but if your daughter's a stripper,
你走遠了
you fucked up.
是吧 你絕對走遠了
Yeah. You went mighty wrong there, baby.
你以為你組了個溫馨小窩?
You thought you had a household?
不 你組了個雞窩
No, you got a ho camp.
我不是存心拿脫衣舞女開涮
You know I'm not making fun of the strippers
她們中的一些的確受過虐待
cos some of these girls were abused.
但有些不過是因為少了些關愛
Some of them just missed a few hugs.
她們說 "爸爸 我們說會兒話吧?"
Some of them were like, "Daddy, can we talk?"
"哎 我看比賽呢"
"Hey, I'm watching the game."
"你等著瞧!"
"I'll show you!"
"我要為克魯小丑樂團的唱片跳裸舞"
美重金屬樂團 團員以頹廢私生活聞名
"I'm gonna dance naked to Motley Crue records."
"我會弄個藝名叫辣臀妹"
俚語 意譯為"火辣的屁股"
"I'm gonna change my name to Cinder Buns"
"我還會去穿透明高跟"
"and I'm gonna wear clear heels."
什麼時候透明高跟成了小姐的標配了?
When did clear heels become the new whore uniform?
什麼時候的事兒?
When did that happen?
是不是一幫小姐一起開過個例會
Was there a big old ho convention
人頭聚齊了說
and all the hoes got together and said,
"咱來點新的東西吧"
"We need something new."
"弄點直接透著淫蕩氣息的"
"Something that just says 'nasty'."
一女的說 "有了! 透明高跟!"
One girl said, "I got it! Clear heels!"
"矮油 你這夠淫蕩"
"Ooh, girl, you disgusting."
"說得好"
"You all right."
我沒跟脫衣舞孃過不去
I got nothing against strippers.
可沒那意思
I got nothing against strippers.
總得有人幹這個
Somebody's gotta do it.
總得有人擔起脫衣舞孃
Somebody has to take on the monumental responsibility
這崇高的責任
that the strippers do.
總得有人做這個
Somebody's gotta do it, 
總得有人來取悅美國的已婚男士
somebody has to entertain the married men of America.
總得有人來做啊
Somebody has to do it.
是不是? 喏 你老婆
OK? Your wife, you know, 
你老婆會悉心照顧你
your wife will take care of you
但老婆不會來取悅你
but she ain't gonna entertain you.
你給你老婆一雙透明高跟
You give your wife clear heels. 
"這是TM什麼東西?"
"What the fuck is this shit?"
"給我把這下流玩意兒扔了"
"Get this ho shit out my house."
"趕緊洗手去 要不別想吃飯"
"Now wash your hands so you can eat."
我對脫衣舞女毫無意見
I got nothing against the strippers.
但脫衣舞俱樂部那真叫一個讓人上癮啊
But the strip clubs are very addictive.
不是說對我 是說對其他人
Not to me but to other people.
很叫人上癮的
They are addictive.
在座的所有哥們兒
Every guy in here
都有一個沉迷於脫衣舞俱樂部的弟兄
got a friend that's addicted to strip clubs.
跟嗑海洛因一樣上癮 有沒有? 癮特大
Addicted like heroin, OK? Addicted.
聽說過沒那些在一般夜店
You know those guys that cannot function
high不起來的男的
in a normal club.
你帶他們去個正常的夜店
You take 'em to a normal club,
他們叫一個妹子給他們跳舞
they ask one girl to dance
"不好意思 能給我跳個舞嗎?"
"Excuse me, would you like to dance?"
"那個 還是待會吧"
"No, maybe a later bit later."
"走了走了 看脫衣舞去"
"Yo, let's go to the titty bar, man."
"我說 這點妹子不靈啊"
"Man, these bitches is stuck up, man."
"我給她塞了一塊錢"
"I gave this bitch a dollar,"
"她什麼都不做哦"
"she didn't do nothing."
不 不 不 我們都認識點
No, no, no, no. We all got those friends
對脫衣舞俱樂部上了癮的朋友
that's addicted to strip clubs.
你知道那些大白天上脫衣舞俱樂部的人不?
You know those guys that go to the strip club in the daytime?
如果太陽還在天上掛著 你已經鑽這俱樂部裏面了
If you're at a strip club and the sun is out,
那你已經有問題了
you got some problems.
那你見過在脫衣舞俱樂部吃飯的男的沒?
You know those guys that eat at the strip club?
TM吃那個自助餐
Eat at the buffet.
你TM怎麼能在脫衣舞俱樂部
How the fuck could you eat
這種齷齪地方吃飯哦?
at a nasty-ass strip club?
咋想的?
What?
你有這麼餓嗎?
Are you that hungry?
我日 你要吃去吃個麥當勞什麼的啊
Motherfucker, go to Mickey D's or some shit.
盧旺達難民都不會跟這兒吃
Rwandan refugees won't eat that shit.
跟脫衣舞俱樂部吃
At a damn strip club.
咪咪跟土豆餅很搭嗎 你吃什麼吃
Titties and Tater Tots don't mix.
但我對脫衣舞女沒任何意見
I got nothing against strippers. 
但我對脫衣舞女的一個傳說就很有異議
What I got a problem with is the stripper myth.
你們都知道這個傳說的
You know the stripper myth.
這個家喻戶曉的傳說
There's a stripper myth that's being perpetuated throughout society.
這個傳說就是
The stripper myth is, 
"我脫 是為了賺我的學費"
"I'm stripping to pay my tuition."
你瞎說你 大學裏有脫衣舞女嗎 (現在還真不好說)
No, you're not. There's no strippers at college.
生物學有教過透明高跟嗎 (這肯定沒有)
There's no clear heels in biology.
我日 我還真沒聽說過哪個大學
Shit, man. I didn't know they had a college
只收一美元鈔票啊
that only took one-dollar bills.
大學裏要真有那麼多跳脫衣舞的
And if they got so many strippers at college,
咋就沒人在我腿上來過段學術點的膝上舞呢?
how come I never got a smart lap dance?
我咋沒遇著哪個妞坐我大腿上一邊扭一邊說
I never got a girl that sat on my lap and said,
"我要是你 就會多元化我的金融資產投資"
"If I was you, I would diversify my portfolio."
"知道不 我發現冷戰結束以後"
"You know, ever since the end of the Cold War,"
"北約就形同虛設了"
"I find NATO obsolete."
我現在有39了 都39歲了
Now, I'm 39 years old, 39 years old.
是啊 有人會問 "真的嗎?" 是真的
Yep. Some people are like, "Really?" Yeah, man.
"紐約黑街"那是老久前的事兒了
New Jack City's a long time ago.
(Chris Rock曾於1991年出演"紐約黑街")
我現在39了 對吧?
Now, I'm 39, right?
可我還是喜歡饒舌 喜歡說唱音樂
And I still love rap music, I love rap music.
都愛死了!
You know, I love it!
都到39這歲數了 
You know, I'm 39, I'm that age,
我自始自終愛著說唱音樂
I've been loving rap music forever.
年齡越大 我越看明白了 
As I get older, I realize I'm gonna 
哪怕80 90了 我還會愛著饒舌
love rap music when I'm 80, 90.
可以說 你第一次打炮時放的音樂
Pretty much whatever music was playing
甭管放的啥
when you started getting laid,
你這輩子就別想放下了
you gonna love that music for the rest of your life.
所以 我特好Whodini這口 (饒舌天才)
So I'm always gonna have a soft spot for Whodini,
懂? 
you know what I mean?
這就是我
That's just me.
我愛饒舌音樂
Now I love rap music 
但我已經不高興再為它辯護了
but I'm tired of defending it.
你必須為饒舌辯護 因為人們總會說
You gotta defend rap music cos people always go, 
"這哪是音樂 哪是藝術 就TM是垃圾"
"That's not music, that's not art. That's garbage"
"你怎麼能聽這種垃圾?"
"How can you listen to that garbage?"
"你怎麼聽這種垃圾?"
"How can you listen to that trash?"
過去 為饒舌辯解很容易的
In the old days, it was easy to defend rap music.
你不用動腦子 就可以輕易為它辯護
It was easy to defend it on an intellectual level.
你可以理性地跟人解釋
You could break it down intellectually
為什麼Grandmaster Flash的作品是藝術
Hiphop史上最偉大的革新者
why Grandmaster Flash was art,
為什麼Run DMC的作品是藝術 
美國著名黑人說唱樂隊 東海岸嘻哈的代表
why Run DMC was art,
為什麼Whodini那是藝術 是音樂
why Whodini was art, and music.
腦子都不用動 輕而易舉為其辯護 是吧?
You could break it down intellectually, OK?
現今的饒舌歌手我都喜歡
And I love all the rappers today
可為他們辯護忒難了
but it's hard to defend this shit.
真心難啊 各位 你叫我怎麼辯護
It's hard, man, it's hard to defend
"每個郵編裏都有我炮友"
出自Ludaris的Area Codes
"I got hoes in different area codes".
這叫我怎麼跟人解釋
On an intellectual level.
你說怎麼辯護
It's hard to defend
"起開 騷貨 別擋路 (暗指男女做愛)"
出自Ludacris的Get Out the Way
"Move, bitch, get out the way".
是這樣的 有個賤貨擋得他動彈不得
Well, as you can see, there's a bitch in his way.
但他得抽身走人啊
Now he needs to move.
所以有了這句 "起開 騷貨 別擋路"
Thus the term, "Move, bitch, get out the way".
你得睜開眼
You need to open yo eyes
才能把這幫小騷貨從身前挪開
so you can get the bitches out of yo way.
我現在的最愛 根本沒法說好話
My favorite song right now is impossible to defend.
想都別想
It's impossible.
喜歡這歌 
We should all be ashamed of ourself 
我們都該為自己害臊
for liking this fucking song.
比如Lil Jon
Lil Jon.
(美國說唱歌手 製作人 嘻哈音樂子類Crunk創始人之一) 
你懂的啊
You know that shit.
# 對著窗! 對著牆! #
# To the window! To the wall! #
# 淌著玉液和瓊漿! #
# To the sweat drip from my balls! #
# 淌著玉液和瓊漿! #
# To the sweat drip from my balls! #
# 射 射 射 射! #
# Skeet, skeet, skeet, skeet! #
你知道這事情野在哪兒嗎?
And you know what's real wild? 
你進了家夜店 
You go to a club, 
看到女的跟著這歌跳得歡吶
you see girls dance to that shit lovely.
# 淌著玉液和瓊漿! #
# To the sweat drip from my balls! #
# 淌著玉液和瓊漿! #
# To the sweat drip from my balls! #
# 淌著玉液! 淌著瓊漿! #
# To the sweat! To the sweat! #
# 淌著玉液和瓊漿! #
# To the sweat drip from my balls! #
# 射 射! 我的蛋蛋喔! #
# My balls! Skeet, skeet! #
# 射 射! 我的蛋蛋喔! #
# My balls! Skeet, skeet! #
# 淌著玉液! 淌著瓊漿! #
# To the sweat! To the sweat! #
# 我的蛋蛋! 我的蛋蛋哦! #
# My balls! My balls! #
所以我特同情那些得
You know, that's why I feel sorry for the guys
從這堆淫才中挑個老婆的哥們兒
that gotta pick a wife out of this bunch.
"爹地 你在哪兒認識媽咪的呀?"
"Daddy, where d'you meet Mommy?"
"哦 當時她在夜店唱蛋蛋的歌"
"Oh, she was singing about balls at a club."
# 射 射 射! #
# Skeet, skeet, skeet! #
也難怪人們會說饒舌音樂歧視女性
That's why people always say rap music is misogynistic
在女性面前很不體面
and it's degrading to women.
可我覺著吧
But what I realize, man,
女的要是喜歡饒舌
is women that like rap
屌都不屌
don't give a fuck.
喜歡饒舌的女人 不管歌詞怎麼唱
Women that like rap don't care what they saying.
只要節拍到位 她能給你蹦上 一 整 晚
If the beat's all right she will dance all night.
女的才不管呢
Women don't give a fuck.
越噁心越帶勁
The nastier the better.
我見過女的合著
I see girls on the floor 
跟著齷齪到不行的歌在那蹦啊
dancing to the nastiest shit ever made.
就在舞池裏這樣哦
Just on the floor, like
# 用老二抽她 用老二抽她 #
# Smack her with a dick, smack her with a dick #
# 用老二抽她 用老二抽她 #
# Smack her with a dick, smack her with a dick #
# 我插她耳朵 我插她耳朵 #
# I'll put a dick in the ear, a dick in the ear #
# 插耳朵 插耳朵 #
# dick in the ear, dick in the ear #
# 插她眼睛 插她眼睛 #
# Fuck her in the eye, fuck her in the eye #
# 插瞎這婊子 插瞎這婊子 #
# Blind the bitch, blind the bitch #
知道最強悍的是什麼不?
And you know what's wild?
要是你對哪個女人說
If you mention to a woman 
這首歌噁心淫蕩 還不尊重婦女
that the song is disgusting and misogynistic,
她們會異口同聲地回答
they all give you the same answer
"又沒說我"
"He ain't talkin' 'bout me."
# 用老二抽她 用老二抽她 #
# Smack her with a dick, smack her with a dick # 
# 我插她耳朵 插她耳朵 #
# I'll put a dick in the ear, a dick in the ear #
- 這說了你名字啊!  - 其實不然 
- He said your name!  - No, he didn't. 
# 用老二抽她 用老二抽她 #
# Smack her with a dick, smack her with a dick #
摯愛說唱 但厭倦了為它辯解 
Love rap music, tired of defending it, man.
說唱音樂的話題有一個很神奇
It's weird with rap music 
就是人們要麼愛 要麼恨 沒有立場不清的人
because people either love it or hate it.
連美國政府都對說唱深惡痛絕
Even the United States Government hates rap.
政府痛說唱啊
The Government hates rap.
知道我為什麼這麼說嗎? 
You know why I say that? 
因為他們不抓任何殺說唱歌手的人
Cos they don't arrest anybody that kills rappers.
他們找不到線索 找不到嫌疑人
They don't got no clues, no suspects.
只要死的是個唱饒舌的 他們屁都找不到
They don't have shit when it's a dead rapper.
他們警方報告都懶得寫
They don't fill out a police report.
屍體的粉筆線都不畫哦
They don't even have a chalk line for a dead rapper.
那警察就對著屍體 一邊撒尿一邊
The cops just take a piss around the body.
# 用老二抽她 用老二抽她 #
# Smack her with a dick, smack her with a dick, #
# 用老二抽她 用老二抽她 #
# smack her with a dick, smack her with a dick #
如果你想殺了人又逍遙法外 
If you wanna get away with murder, 
只要衝誰腦袋放一槍
just shoot somebody in the head
然後往他口袋裏塞盤試聽帶啊
and put a demo tape in they pocket.
"死的是個唱饒舌的 我們走吧"
"This is a rap killing, let's get outta here."
政府痛恨說唱啊
The Government hates rap.
看看這點搞說唱的 所有掛了的說唱歌手 
Look at all the rappers, all the dead rappers. 
哦我今天要他們名字列出來了我
I'm gonna list these motherfuckers, man.
Biggie Smalls啊(黑人說唱歌手) Biggie Smalls 
Biggie Smalls, man. Biggie Smalls, man.
Biggie Smalls 是在洛杉磯的一個聚會外被人槍殺的
Biggie Smalls gunned down outside a party in Los Angeles.
Biggie體重差不多400磅 (362.8斤)
Now Biggie weighed about 400 pounds.
所以他們得射他一小會兒啊
So they had to shoot him for a while.
在車上還換了幾次子彈啊
There was some reloading in that drive-by.
就像一顆子彈得打中前面打進去的那顆...
It's like the bullet had to hit another bullet that went in before it...
才能有點殺傷力啊
just to really do damage.
他們沒線索 沒嫌疑犯
They don't got no clues, no suspects,
除了個肥仔唱饒舌的 什麼都沒!
a hamburger wrapper, nothing!
Jam Master Jay啊 (說唱界巨頭) 我特想他
Jam Master Jay, man. Jay, man, I miss Jay.
特懷念
I miss that man.
對 Jam Master Jay
Jam Master Jay.
是在皇后區的一個錄音棚裏被槍殺的 好嗎?
Gunned down in a recording studio in Queens, OK?
他們有監控錄像拍著所有進進出出的人
They had surveillance footage of people coming in and out,
卻連個屁都沒抓
they ain't arrest nobody.
好像那人進了錄音棚 把Jay做掉
It's like the guy came in the studio, shot Jay,
錄了張唱片 然後就走了
recorded an album, then left.
他們屁都沒逮著啊
They ain't get nobody.
沒線索 沒嫌疑人 
No clues, no suspects, 
連塊鞋墊都沒!
not a Odor-Eater, nothing!
Tupac Shakur哦 (黑人說唱歌手) 
Tupac Shakur, man.
Tupac Shakur 真可惜
Tupac Shakur, man.
Tupac在邁克·泰森拳擊賽後
Yo, Tupac was gunned down on the Las Vegas Strip
被槍殺在拉斯維加斯大道
after a Mike Tyson fight.
我說要幾個目擊者
Now how many witnesses 
你丫才能有眉目
do you need to see some shit
去抓一兩個人?
before you arrest somebody?
艸
Shit.
看到Tupac被殺的人
More people saw Tupac get shot
比收看 "宋飛傳" 大結局的人還多
than the last episode of Seinfeld.
(宋飛傳 高收視率美劇)
最扯淡的是 每年 Tupac都起死回生
And you know what's fucked up? Every year, Tupac comes back from the dead,
錄上一張藏有他被殺線索的新專輯...
records a new album with clues in it...
(藝人死後唱片公司會錄製紀念專輯)
只要你仔細地聽 每張專輯都有線索啊
Every record got a clue if you listen real hard.
"穿紅衣服的那個 射死了我" 就這句!
"The brother in the red shot me dead." Right there!
第四首! Pac在給我們線索啊 再聽一遍!
Track four! Pac is trying to tell us something. Listen again!
"是個叫Kevin的黑鬼" 就這裏啊! 
"It was a nigger named Kevin." Right there!
Pac在向我們吶喊啊 仔細聽!
Pac is reaching out to us. Listen!
政府痛恨說唱啊  
The Government hates rap, man.
也只有說唱歌手被槍殺後是這結果
And only rappers get gunned down like this.
我可以立馬告訴你 
I'll tell you right now, 
如果Billy Joel Elton John和David Bowie被槍殺
均為美著名白人歌手
if Billy Joel, Elton John and David Bowie got shot,
他們直接把Bruce Springsteen家給圍了啊
they'd have Bruce Springsteen's house surrounded.
(美國搖滾巨星 前三位的競爭對手)
政府憎恨說唱
The Government hates rap.
死的都是最讚的說唱歌手 都是最讚的
Only the good rappers are dead, only the good ones.
Biggie死了 Tupac死了
Biggie dead, Tupac dead,
Vanilla Ice卻還活著 (白人說唱歌手)
Vanilla Ice still alive.
政府真是恨說唱
The Government hates rap.
你說他們能在一個狗洞裏把薩達姆揪出來
You mean to tell me they can find Saddam Hussein in a fucking hole
他們找不出誰殺了Tupac?
but you can't tell me who shot Tupac?
扯淡
Shit.
他們TM在伊拉克逮的薩達姆啊
They found Saddam Hussein in fucking Iraq.
Tupac在拉斯維加斯被害了好吧!
Tupac got shot in Vegas!
TM拉斯維加斯啊!
In fucking Vegas!
不是跪在什麼小巷子裏 
Not on no side street, 
TM跪在拉斯維加斯大道上啊!
the motherfucker got shot on the Strip!
就在Circus Circus酒店前啊!
In front of Circus Circus!
(Circus Circus 拉斯維加斯著名賭場酒店)
艸
Damn.
都TM瘋了 整個世界都TM瘋了
It's all fucked up, the whole world's fucked up, man.
邁克爾·傑克遜腦子也壞了
Michael Jackson lost his mind.
邁克爾是搞什麼呢? 又一個小孩?
指MJ涉嫌兒童性騷擾
What the hell is wrong with Michael? Another kid?
又來一個?
Another kid?
我剛聽到這事 還以為是 "土撥鼠日" 啊
I thought it was Groundhog's Day when I heard that shit.
(一部時光回溯電影 喻指事情重複發生)
又一個? 你能不能行啊
Another kid? Get the fuck out of here.
我們有多愛邁克爾哦
That's how much we love Michael.
這第一個小孩冒出來的時候 我們直接略過了
We love Michael so much, we let the first kid slide.
他可寫了Billie Jean 放他一馬
暢銷單曲 其中他首次展示太空步
Hey, man, the man made Billie Jean, leave him alone.
又孌童? 我TM受夠了 
Another kid? I'm fucking done. 
真TM受夠了!
I'm done with Michael!
我曾是他的超級粉迷
I was a fan my whole life.
真TM受夠了啊 我手套給你們了 行吧
I am fucking done, I am handing in my glove, OK.
（MJ演唱會的招牌動作)
我在 "60分鐘" 裏看到了他
美國王牌電視新聞雜誌
I saw Michael on 60 Minutes.
Ed Bradley使出渾身解數 (節目主持人)
Ed Bradley tried his best
想讓邁克爾看起來算個哺乳動物
to make Michael look like a mammal,
至少一個喝水吸空氣正常人 對吧?
or somebody that drank water and breathed air, right?
他問了邁克爾世界上最簡單的問題 
He gave Michael the easiest questions in the world, 
世界上最簡單的"普通教育程度測試" 題
the easiest GED questions in the world,
而邁克爾卻連這都通不過
and Michael could not pass the test.
他就這樣 "額 邁克爾"
It's like, "Uh, Michael,"
"你認為一個45歲的男人"
"do you think it's proper for a 45-year-old man"
"和13歲的少男睡在一張床上 合適嗎?"
"to sleep in a bed with 13-year-old boys?"
"合適!"
"Yes!"
"好 好 我再組織一下語言"
"OK, OK, uh, let me rephrase that."
"額 邁克爾"
"Uh, Michael,"
"你會讓你的孩子 睡在一個45歲 曾被控兒童性騷擾的"
"would you let your children sleep in the bed of a 45-year-old man"
"男的的床上嗎?"
"that's been accused of child molestation?"
"會啊!"
"Yes!"
Ed Bradley看著邁克爾·傑克遜的眼神
Ed Bradley looked at Michael Jackson 
就好像想說
like he wanted to say,
"我艸 你這搞毛啊?"
"Nigger, is you crazy?"
就好像他迫不及待
Like he wanted to take the 60 Minutes clock 
想抄起節目裏的鍾往前撥 (限定60分鐘)
and push the shit forward,
然後吼一聲 "給我滾"
say, "Get the fuck off my show."
"我還以為有60分鐘呢" 
"I thought you said it was 60 minutes."  
"是十分鐘 走人了"
"It's ten minutes, get outta here."
"你這二逼老黑TM搞什麼啊?"
"Ya nutty nigger, what the fuck is wrong wit' you?"
我受夠了Michael了 
I'm done with Michael, man. 
你看他連出庭都遲到20分鐘
You see Michael go to court 20 minutes late.
什麼樣的黑人 敢晚出庭20分鐘?
What kind of black man gonna come to court 20 minutes late?
又不是 "理髮店2" (上映比原定要晚)
This ain't Barbershop 2.
這是法庭啊 我日
This is court, motherfucker. Shit.
他出庭也不穿個正裝
He don't even wear a real suit to court,
穿得跟Cap'n Crunch麥片包裝上的船長一樣
coming in there looking like Cap'n Crunch.
我日 你律師誰啊? Franken Berry嗎? (另一種麥片卡通形象)
Shit, who's your lawyer? Franken Berry?
真該把你領到Banana Republic (服裝品牌)
Better take your black ass to Banana Republic 
去買套像樣點的衣服
and get you a decent suit.
那小子是他娘的是有病吧? 受不了啊
What the fuck is wrong with that boy? I'm done with Michael.
又來一個?
Another kid?
這就像是在OJ家裏
Ano... That's like another dead white girl 
又有了白人女性屍體一樣
showing up at OJ's house.
臭名卓著的殺人犯 對其的審判被稱為 "世紀審判"
OJ會說 "我知道你在想什麼..." 
And OJ going, "I know what you're thinking..."
(審判中 OJ的經典說辭)
邁克爾·傑克遜要坐牢了 這叫人那個心碎啊
Michael Jackson going to jail. It's gonna be a sad sight when Michael Jackson goes to jail.
他去坐牢我們說不定會抹下眼淚哦
Oh, we gonna shed a tear when Michael Jackson go to jail.
進去當天我們可能還不覺得什麼
It ain't even gonna be sad the day he go in.
可能要一個月以後
It's gonna be sad like a month later
等他的卷毛長出來
when that perm grows out of his hair.
這頭髮又灰 又毛 (諷刺MJ露出黑人體貌特徵了)
The shit's all nappy and grey.
等他化的妝都花了
When his make-up's all fucked up
因為沒人用"繪兒樂" 蠟筆
cos he don't get the Crayola people 
給他補妝了
to fix his face no more.
(諷刺那些整容機構不專業)
這場景真叫人心碎啊
That's a fucking sad-ass sight.
記得我們曾爭過 
Remember we used to have arguments 
M.J. 和Prince誰更出色(音樂天才)
about who was better, Michael Jackson or Prince?
Prince贏了啊
Prince won.
是啊 Michael瘋了
Yeah, man, Michael went crazy,
接著 Janet腦子進水了(邁克爾·傑克遜的妹妹)
then Janet lost her damn mind,

"額滴神啊!"
"Oh, Lord!"
禮拜天下午 一對咪咪
A titty on a Sunday afternoon.
還尼瑪是對40歲的咪咪
And a 40-year-old titty at that.
40歲的咪咪是說拿出來秀就能拿出來秀的嗎
You can't just whip out a 40-year-old titty.
那是你男人私有的咪咪啊
That's yo man's titty.
你男人獨享的
That is yo man's titty.
40歲咪咪... 老公獨享
40-year-old titty... yo man's titty.

20-year-old titty... community titty.
那才是給所有人看的
That's for all to see.
你咪咪自個兒都不相信自己出來了啊
The titty couldn't even believe it was outside.
它就這樣 "我去 這什麼情況?"
It was like, "Oh, shit, what the fuck's going on?"
"快關門! 快關門啊!"
"Close the door! Close the door!"
邁克爾瘋了 她妹腦子也進水了
Michael's crazy, Janet lost her mind,
現在我每周都密切關注Jermaine
Michael Jakson 的哥哥
now I gotta see Jermaine every week for the blow-by-blow.
我覺得我也受不了他了
I thought I was done with Jermaine.
你聽他那張"做你曾經對我做過的事" 專輯
I got the "Do What You Did When You Did What To Me" album.
我受夠他了 Jermaine貌似比他弟還抽
I thought I was done with Jermaine. Jermaine looked crazier than Michael.
Jermaine又什麼情況?
What the fuck is up with Jermaine?
你們有沒有覺得Jermaine和我
Is it me or is Jermaine 
是你們見過最油頭粉面的黑人了?
the greasiest nigger you ever seen in your life?
搞什麼鬼? 我去!
What the fuck? My God, man!
他是往臉上噴了鞋油還怎麼著?
Does he spray Armor All on his face or some shit?
這也太油了啊 我日

像NBA裏打到第四節的
Just glistening like Patrick Ewing 
帕特裏克·尤因啊 (綽號大猩猩)
in the fourth quarter.
這... 這黏得啊
Just... just slimy.
油得都發亮了啊 我去
Just greasy, shiny motherfucker, my God.

I can't see shit
肯定是Jermaine出鏡了
Jermaine must have been on.
警察都抓不住他啊
The police can't even capture his ass
因為他直接從警察手裏滑出去了啊
cos he just slips out.
警察們就喊 "快往那黑鬼身上撒點沙子! 快!"
The police are like, "Somebody throw some sand on that nigger! Please!"
傑克遜一家瘋了 勞·凱利也瘋了 
Jacksons lost they mind, R Kelly lost his mind and shit.
(美國節奏布魯斯歌手 作曲人 唱片製作人)
勞·凱利怎麼回事? 他這膽子夠肥啊 是不是?
What the fuck is wrong with R Kelly? He got a lot of balls, OK?
還說什麼 "不是我!"
Talk about, "It ain't me!"
都流出性愛錄像帶了 還說"不是我"
Got a damn sex tape out. "It ain't me."

那靈魂列車音樂獎獎盃就在你床邊啊!
被譽為"黑人格萊美音樂獎"
There's a damn Soul Train award right next to the bed!
98年最佳RnB歌手 就是你啊!
Best R & B '98, that's you!
沒想到出了這破事之後 勞·凱利還敢重返娛樂圈
I can't even believe R Kelly would come outside after this shit.
錄像帶上的某一段 
At one point on the tape, 
勞·凱利啃那妞的屁股 就像在啃巧克力麥片一樣啊
R Kelly's eating this girl's ass out like it's Puppy Chow.
他舔她屁股那投入得 就像他得了糖尿病
He's in her ass like he's got diabetes
而她菊花會分泌胰島素一樣
and her ass got insulin in it.
搞得像電影 "驚變28天" 一樣 (電影中有這樣的鏡頭)
Lookin' like the movie 28 Days Later.
勞你大爺的凱利啊
R fucking Kelly, man.
整個世界都亂套了 
The whole world's going crazy, man.

兩位德國著名魔術師 擅長耍虎師
Siegfried and Roy, the tiger bit the man in the head,
所有人都恨那個老虎
and everybody's mad at the tiger.
說什麼老虎變瘋了
Talk about the tiger went crazy.
屁 那老虎沒變瘋了嗎 那老虎變老虎了啊!
That tiger ain't go crazy, that tiger went tiger!
你知道老虎什麼時候才叫瘋了?
You know when the tiger went crazy?
等它帶著黨衛軍鋼盔
When the tiger was riding round on a little bike 
騎著小自行車四處逛的時候
with a Hitler helmet on.
"我擦 我真是只瘋老虎啊"
"Oh, shit, I'm a crazy tiger."
"天哪 我瘋了 咋辦啊?"
"Oh, Lord, I'm crazy. What is I gon' do?"
我們整個國家都TM瘋了
Whole damn country's all fucked up.
我們渴望娛樂啊
We so desperate for entertainment
誰都迷David Blaine這魔術師
everybody's falling for this magician, David Blaine.
他這TM算搞什麼? 
What the fuck is this shit? 
我們就這麼絕 要買一個黔驢技窮魔術師的帳?
Are we so desperate that we fall for a trickless magician?
這他媽都玩的什麼把戲?
Where the fuck's the trick?
把個女人一砍二! 從帽子裏拽隻兔子!
Cut a lady in half! Pull a rabbit out a hat!
玩點有新意的吧 他的壓軸戲是什麼?
Do something. What's his last trick?
"我待在箱子裏..."
"I'm in a box..."
"然後我不吃飯"
"and I ain't gonna eat."
"我待在箱子裏 然後我不吃飯"
"I'm in a box and I ain't gonna eat."
這算哪門子魔術 這叫排隊等廉租房啊
That ain't no trick, that's called living in the projects.
去你妹的
Shit, man.
科比·布萊恩也瘋了 
美NBA球員 洛杉磯湖人隊 得分後衛
Kobe Bryant lost his mind.
科比他TM想什麼呢?
What the fuck is Kobe thinking?
他腦子是不是被驢踢了 轉去科羅拉多 
What is on Kobe's mind going to Colorado,
被一圈白人圍著啊
around all these white people,
美著名辛普森案 辯護律師
還不帶著Johnnie Cochran?
and not bringing Johnnie Cochran?
你得帶上Johnnie啊
You gotta bring Johnnie to that shit.
那女的還活著啊 
The girl's still alive, 
Johnnie兩周就能把這事擺平了
Johnnie'll knock this out in two weeks.
"她還有呼吸嗎?" 
"Is she breathing?" 
"淡定"
"Don't worry about it."
有了Johnnie 科比一場練習
Kobe wouldn't miss a practice 
都不會缺了 搞毛?
if he had Johnnie. What the fuck, man?
有人說這麼搞不行啊
It don't look right, man. 
有些人就說 "你雇Johnnie Cochran"
Some people like, "If you hire Johnnie Cochran" 
"就說明你心虛"
"you look guilty."
是 但你回家睡你的豪華席夢思啊
Yeah, but you go home.
哦 你想無辜地睡班房的鋼絲床?
What, you wanna look innocent in jail?
那我寧可在購物中心被人指指點點
I'd rather look guilty at the mall.
科比有可能坐牢 誰說得準呢
Kobe might go to jail, you never know.
很多人說 "科比不會蹲大牢"
A lot of people, "Oh, Kobe ain't gonna go to jail"
"因為他... 精明又可愛"
"cos Kobe's... cute and cuddly."
"他才不會蹲大牢"
"He is not gonna go to jail."
"對 他精明可愛 又積極向上的"
"No, he's cute and cuddly, he's positive."
是 科比在電視上看起來是精明又可愛
Yeah, Kobe looks cute and cuddly on TV
那是因為你看見他的時候
cos when you see him
他都站在奧尼爾旁邊啊
he's standing next to Shaq.
可在現實生活中的科比 大概有個2米高
But in real life Kobe's like 6'9", 6'10".
艸 他一走上法庭
Shit, when he get to court,
肯定把那幫白人嚇得屁滾尿流啊
he gonna scare the shit out of them white people.
他們會當他是只
They gonna look at him 
黑黝黝的老螳螂
like he's a big old black praying mantis.
他往證人席這一坐 膝蓋有這麼高
He gonna sit down at the witness stand, his knees gonna be up here.
他把手往聖經上一放 尼瑪把整本聖經都蓋住了啊
Put his hand on the Bible, it covers up the whole Bible.
然後你就能看到那女的 她來法庭了 
And you see the girl, she came to court, 
現在規矩了
she wasn't fucking around.
沒錯 她看起來乖乖女哦
That's right. She looked nice.
她穿著套褲 紮著小辮
She got a nice pantsuit on, got her hair in pigtails.
沒錯 她這會兒不穿透明高跟了
Yeah, she ain't gonna have on no clear heels now, no.
(科比案女原告性生活混亂)
對 她現在穿著舒適的平底鞋
That's right. She got on some comfortable flats.
還有厚得要死的長筒襪
And some thick-ass stockings.
真是開眼了 竟然有這麼厚的長筒襪
The thickest fucking stockings you ever seen in your life.
這厚得人家以為她腿斷了打了石膏啊 
You gonna think she broke her leg,
這襪子就有這麼厚
that's how thick them fucking stockings is.
她得這樣走著進法庭
She gonna come in the court like this.
"法官大人 我的長筒襪真TM厚"
"Your Honor, my stockings are fucking thick."
很多人會說 
Now a lot of people say, 
"這就是科比劈腿的報應"
"Well, this is what Kobe gets for cheating."
"這是他出軌的下場"
"That's what he get for cheating."
"他出軌了 就這下場 他該"
"He cheated and that's what he gets."
我知道你們中有些女人也被男人劈過腿 
I know some of you women been cheated on before. 
我知道你們中...

OK, fuck it, I'm sure most of you women been cheated on before.
有些今晚跟你一起來的男的就在劈腿
Some of y'all are with the guy that cheated on you right now.
他們現在心裏在想 "你TM說夠了沒?"
And the guy's are like, "Would you shut the fuck up?"
"說點老花頭嘛 爆個菊花什麼的 隨便來一個!"
"Do some old shit, 'toss my salad', one of them. Come on!"
哎呀哎呀 男人就是賤啊 婦女朋友們
No, no, no. Men are just low, ladies.
有些人會說 "哦我要是瘦點 他就不會出軌了"
Some women are like, "If I lost weight, he wouldn't cheat."
"如果... 如果..."
"If... If... If..."
"如果我再漂亮點 他就不會出軌了"
"If I was more beautiful, he wouldn't cheat."
他會的
Yes, he would.
他就是狗改不了吃屎 你無能為力的親
He would, he would. There ain't nothing you can do, ladies.
想阻止你男人出軌 你唯一能做的就是...
The only thing you can do to stop your man cheating...
所以女人的耳朵都豎起來了...
The women are like this...
你唯一能做的...
Only thing you can do...
就是待在那兒
is be there.
哪兒? 那兒
Where? There.
他想在盤算上別人的地方 你就跑過去
Wherever he's thinking about fucking her. That's it.
一定要在邊上 但這樣他還會乘機溜號
Just be right there. And even then he still might lose yo ass.
"哈尼 快看 大降價! 我趕緊上了那貨"
"Hey, honey, look, a sale! Let me go fuck this bitch right now."
我說! 不 不行 不行 
Oh, man! No, no, no, no, no.
美貌不管用 科比出軌 可他老婆挺好啊
The beauty don't matter. Kobe cheated on his wife and Kobe's wife is fine.
科比的老婆相當漂亮啊 我去!
Kobe's wife is gorgeous. My God!
這貨腦子肯定臭掉了
That's a fuckin'searita out this motherfucker.
簡直TM秀逗了
A hot tamale out this motherfucker.
科比老婆真心漂亮啊
Kobe's wife is fine shit. 
拿我老婆加兩個小姨子換他老婆我都肯
I would trade my wife and two aunts for Kobe's, man.
有必要的話 我連表妹跟老媽都搭進去啊
I'll throw in a cousin and my momma if I have to.
行了老媽 這買賣趕緊敲定了
Come on, Momma, we got to close this deal.
但是你 別讓這些名人八卦給忽悠了
But yo, don't let all this celebrity news fool you right now.
新聞裏的這些玩意兒
All this stuff going on in the news
都是為了分散你的
is just a trick to get yo mind 
注意力 僅此而已
off the war. That's all it is.
讓你分心的小把戲
It's a trick to get yo mind off the war.
明白嗎?
OK?
我說這都是小布什干的
I think Bush sent that girl to Kobe's room.
是小布什派那女的去科比屋裏 
Bush sent that girl to Kobe's room, 
布什派那個小男孩去Michael家裏
Bush sent that little boy to Michael Jackson's house,
布什殺了Laci Peterson (美國婦女 為其夫所殺)
Bush killed Laci Peterson.
是布什在那段錄像帶裏干的希爾頓家千金
03年帕麗斯與前男友的性愛影片風靡網絡
Bush was fucking Paris Hilton in that video.
都是為了分散你的注意力
All to get yo mind off the war.
布什忽悠我啊 誰都這麼忽悠我
Bush lied to me, they all lied to me.
"我們得去伊拉克"
"We gotta go to Iraq"
"因為他們是世界上最危險的國家"
"cos they the most dangerous country on earth."
"他們是世界上最危險的政權"
"They the most dangerous regime in the world."
他們要真那麼危險 你們怎麼可能兩周之內
If they so dangerous, how come it only took two weeks
就把人家整個國家給推了?
to take over the whole fucking country?
艸
Shit.
兩周你TM連巴爾的摩都推不了啊
Man, you couldn't take over Baltimore in two weeks.
美馬里蘭州第一大城市 佔地238.4平方公里 常住人口超過62萬
(巴爾的摩港曾是美國第二大移民登陸的港口)
少JB扯淡了
Get the fuck outta here.
哦找什麼大規模殺傷性武器
Looking for weapons of mass destruction.
TM連個塑料魔球棒都找不到
Can't even find a Wiffle ball bat.
連個蒼蠅拍都沒有 至少找點啥出來嘛!
Ain't even a fucking fly-swatter yet. Give me something, shit! 
進攻 你妹的 進攻啊!
Attack, motherfucker. Attack!
繳個裁紙刀也好啊 什麼都沒有!
Let me get a fucking paper cut over that motherfucker. Nothing!
屁都沒
Not a damn thing.
"大規模殺傷性武器啊"
"Weapons of mass destruction."
他們抓到誰來著 對抓到了老薩 不錯 
They got whatshisname, they got Saddam Hussein, that's cool.
他們抓到薩達姆的時候 我還有點小傷心
I was a little sad when they got Saddam.
就好像郊狼終於逮到走鵑一樣 (中美洲鳥名)
That's kinda like the Coyote catching the Roadrunner.
原來Acme動畫公司還真拍個點靠譜的片子啊
I guess Acme finally made some shit that worked.
(上片即為Acme動畫公司之作品)
我都不知道他們是去抓老薩的
I didn't even know we was after Saddam, 
還以為我們在抓本·拉登呢
I thought we was after Bin Laden.
咋搞的?
What the fuck happened?
還以為我們要抓拉登呢
I thought we was after Bin Laden.
艸 拉登啥時候把仇恨接力棒傳給老薩的?
Shit. When did Bin Laden give Hussein the baton of hate?
什麼時候? "他們恨我 他們恨我..."
When did he pass it on? "They hate me, they hate me..."
- "他們恨你! 快跑! "  - "我擦"
- "they hate you! Run! "  - "Oh, shit."
我日 聽說他們去抓侯賽因的時候
Shit, man, when I heard we was after Hussein, 
我還說 "真的假的?"
I was like, "Really?"
真太懷舊了
That's so '80s.
整場戰爭就像VH1的蹩腳特別節目 
美國專門播放音樂和脫口秀的電視台
The whole war seemed like a bad VH1 special.
侯賽因復出了 布什復出了
Hussein's back and Bush is back 
切尼也復出了(美前副總統)
and Cheney's back
連Paula Abdul都回來了 (美國歌手 X音素評委)
and Paula Abdul's back.
妹的 你還沒回過神 可能又要放Hammertime了
20世紀末美國流行的真人秀
Shit, before you know it, it'll be Hammertime again.
停
Stop.
Hammertime了
Hammertime.
仗剛剛開打的時候沒什麼問題 好得很
No, when the war started, it was great.
激起很多愛國熱情 愛國主義是好東西 真挺好的
Brought out a lot of patriotism. Patriotism's beautiful. Beautiful.
但是慢慢地 愛國主義肯定會變成仇恨主義
But slowly but surely, the patriotism turned into hate-riotism.
剛開打的時候都挺正常的 大家都開始掛國旗
When the war started, it was great. People had their flags up.
大家不管什麼事情都要喊"USA! "
People screaming out "USA! " for no reason.
你去看棒球 足球 或者籃球 誰都在"USA..."
You go to a baseball game, a football game, a basketball game, people are, "USA..."
我就會說 "嘿 冷靜"
I'm like, "Hey, calm down."
"咱這是不是有點法西斯的味道了? "
"That's got a little German on it, don't you think? "
然後大家就開始亂來了
You know, people start freaking out.
大家都會這樣...
People got it...
仗剛開始打的時候挺好 然後大家都開始怨法國
At first the war was cool. People got into this whole hate the French thing.
我還真搞不懂這邏輯 "去他媽的法國"
I don't understand that shit. "Fuck France, man." 
"他們都不幫我們 去他妹的"
"They don't wanna help us out. Fuck France."
"別吃薯條了 去他大爺的法國貨"
"Don't eat no French fries. Fuck the French, man.
"MB的法國佬 去你媽的" 就因為他們不幫我們打伊拉克
"Motherfuck France, fuck 'em, man." Cos they wouldn't help us out in the war.
好吧 美國是世界上軍力最強大的國家
The United States is the biggest, most powerful country in the world.
我們跟伊拉克開干為什麼得別人來幫?
Why the fuck would anybody help us in the war?
邁克泰森去打Urkel你會去幫忙麼?
Would you help Mike Tyson beat up Urkel?
Steve Urkel 美情景喜劇演員
主要形象為帶著啤酒瓶底眼鏡的呆子
這不扯的嘛!
Don't make no sense!
但是人們開始亂來了
But people started freaking out.
戰爭很奇怪 電視上會冒出來一些奇怪的白人
The war was weird. On TV you'd see these weird white guys.
不是說你們 你們沒事
Nobody here, you guys are OK.
看到那些變得過度愛國的白人
See these weird white guys getting overly patriotic
戴插著國旗的帽子啊 開舖著國旗的皮卡啊
and they have their fucking flag hats on and their flag drawers and their flag pick-ups.
"我是美國人啊 我是美國人"
"I'm American, man, I'm American."
"去TMD外國人 我是美國人..."
"Fuck all these fucking foreigners. I'm American..."
我心裏想 "哎 你TM能淡定點不"
You're like, "Hey, calm the fuck down."
戰爭一開始 一些種族主義的存在就被默許了
There was a lot of accepted racism when the war started.
"我是美國人... 去TMD外國人" 這沒關係
"I'm American... Fuck all these foreigners." And that was cool.
然後就 "我是美國人... 去TMD法國人" 這也沒問題
Then it was, "I'm American... Fuck the French." That was cool.
"我是美國人... 去TMD阿拉伯人"
"I'm American... Fuck all these Arabs."
這還是沒問題 但他們然後就
And that was cool. Then they went to,
"我是美國人... 去TMD非法移民" 這時候我耳朵就豎起來了
"I'm American... Fuck all these illegal aliens." Then I started listening.
因為我知道接下來罵的就是黑人和猶太人了
Cos I know niggers and Jews is next.
隨便哪天聽到這個都是這樣
It's like, any day now!
別指望這班火車能拖班!
That train's never late!
後來人們都開始叫囂他們是美國人
And people started screaming they was American.
許多白人喜歡叫囂他們是美國人
A lot of white people like to scream they're American
就好像他們為這個國家做過什麼貢獻一樣
as if they got something to do with the country being the way it is.
好像他們是乘著Mayflower號來開墾美國的人
Mayflower 1620年英國清教徒去北美殖民地所乘之船名
Like they was on the Mayflower or some shit.
你要真細想 這間房間裏都沒這麼多
When you break it down, there ain't even that many Americans in this room,
為美國做貢獻的美國人
contributing Americans.
這麼說吧 如果你是退伍老兵 你參加了美利堅合眾國任何一場戰爭
Check this out. If you a veteran, if you fought in any war for the United States,
那你是美國人 上帝保佑所有的老兵
You are American. God bless all the veterans.
為他們豎一個大拇指 無可挑剔
Big up to the veterans. I can't say nothing wrong about the veterans.
是不是? 你們算美國人
OK? You're American.
但 如果你是從某些個狗屁的國家游泳過來的
Now if you swam here from some shitty country
那些Bubblicious也不合法的國家
that didn't allow you Bubblicious,
(Bubblicious 一種美國口香糖)
你 也是美國人
You too are American
因為你為來到這裏克服過困難 做出了犧牲
Cos you overcame obstacles and made sacrifices to actually get here.
你算個真正的美國人 好嗎?
You are a true American, OK?
真的 沒人可以說你和別的美國人有什麼不同
You really are. Don't let nobody tell you no different.
剩下的每一位 你們只不過是人品好
Everybody else, you're just lucky.
你們都只不過人品好 所有那些喜歡叫 "我是美國人!" 的白人
You're just lucky. All you crazy white people, "I'm American!"
你們所做的 只是從你媽B裏跑出來 掉在美國領土上了 僅此而已
All you did was come out of your mother's pussy on American soil. That's it.
僅此而已
That's it.
哦你認為你比那些法國佬要牛逼
You think you're better than somebody from France
就因為你從一個B裏出來 掉在了底特律?
cos you came out of a pussy in Detroit?
整個國家的腦子都TM壞掉了
The whole country's got a fucked up mentality, man.
沒事就要拉幫結派
We all got a gang mentality.
共和黨的那些二貨 民主黨的那些二貨
Republicans are fucking idiots, the Democrats are fucking idiots,
保守派的那些二貨 還有自由派的那些二貨
conservatives are idiots and liberals are idiots.
任何在沒有聽到一個問題之前就確定立場的人就TM是個BS...
Anyone that makes up they mind before they hear the issue is a fucking fool...
不管是誰...
Everybody...
誰都心急慌忙地要進個團伙
No, no. Everybody's so busy wanting to be down with a gang
"我保守主義 我自由主義" 都TM放屁
"I'm a conservative, I'm a liberal." It's bullshit.
做一個正常人行不行 先聽!
Be a fucking person. Listen!
把聽到的東西先在腦子轉一下
Let it swirl around yo head.
然後再說你怎麼看的
Then form yo opinion.
沒有一個正常人什麼事情都一邊倒的 懂?
No normal, decent person is one thing, OK?
有些事情我保守一點 有些事情我開明一點
I got some shit I'm conservative about, I got some shit I'm liberal about.
殺人放火 我保守一點
Crime, I'm conservative.
賣淫嫖娼 我開明一點
Prostitution, I'm liberal.
然後他們一直想恐嚇我們 誰都想要嚇我們
And they keep trying to scare us. Everybody's trying to scare us.
告訴我們要防著基地組織 "在什麼地方什麼地方..."
Telling us to be on the lookout for al-Qaeda. Like, "Where..."
我才不怕基地組織 我是布魯克林來的 基地組織管我屁事
I ain't scared of al-Qaeda. I'm from Brooklyn, I don't give a fuck about al-Qaeda.
艸 什麼狗屁基地組織
Shit. Motherfucking al-Qaeda.
艸 是基地組織炸的俄克拉何馬聯邦大樓嗎? 
Shit, did al-Qaeda blow up the building in Oklahoma?
沒
該案系美國白人恐怖分子所為
No.
是基地組織給你寄的疽菌郵件嗎?
Did al-Qaeda put anthrax in your mail?
沒
No.
是基地組織把James Byrd(美國黑人)掛在皮卡後面拖上三英里
Did al-Qaeda drag James Byrd down the street
直到他眼珠子爆出他的腦袋嗎? 沒
till his eyeballs popped out of his fucking head? No.
我不怕基地組織 我怕的是Al-Cracker(指美國白人恐怖分子)
I ain't scared of al-Qaeda, I'm scared of Al-Cracker.
前文所述俄克拉何馬聯邦大樓爆炸案 系美退伍軍人Timothy McVeigh所為
該案造成168人死亡 超過800人受傷 是9·11前美國本土遭受的最嚴重的恐怖襲擊 
白人恐怖分子啊 我們必須得提防住
Cracker Al. Gotta look out for Cracker Al.
這種人才叫危險!
He's a dangerous motherfucker!
但是各位 只要你...
But American people, whenever you leave...
我愛我的祖國 但只要你踏出國門 你就會發現別人很恨美國
I love my country, but whenever you leave, you find out people really hate America.
但有時候這是件好事
It's good sometimes.
因為這說明我們擁有的實在太多了 懂?
Cos we got so much shit, OK?
美國是世界上唯一一個物資豐富還去侵略別人的國家
America's the only country in the world where people go hunting on a full stomach.
這給力得啊
It's beautiful.
我們就是這個好法 我們這國家真棒極了
That's how good we got it. America's a great country.
但事情是這樣的 我們下不了決心到底做一個怎麼樣的國家 所以遭人恨
But here's the thing, people hate America cos we can't make up our mind what we wanna be.
美國做過好事 美國做過壞事 美國也做過很腦殘的事
America does good things, America does bad things, America does schizophrenic things.
有一件美國做的事很了不起 而且我很欣賞 就是美國救濟其他國家
One cool thing America does, that I love, is we feed other countries.
我們救濟別的國家 很好
It's beautiful that we feed other countries.
是的 很好
Yes, it is!
但... 但我們只在人家快餓嗝屁的時候才去救
But... But we only feed them when they're starving.
為什麼我們不在他們剛開始餓的時候就去救呢?
Why can't we feed them when they're hungry?
人家沒一覺醒來 人就臭了蒼蠅亂叮 肚子腹水鼓成這樣
They didn't just wake up with flies around their lips and bellies out to here.
變成這樣不是一天兩天的事情啊
It took a while for shit to get that bad.
但美國政府就 "不急不急 等蒼蠅來了再說"
And our government's like, "Nah, nah, wait for the flies."
"再等兩周 等蒼蠅來叮了 快啊 再來點蒼蠅"
"Two more weeks. Wait for the flies. Come on, more flies!"
我們給他們送糧食 但我們給別人送什麼好東西了嗎? 沒
And we send them food. Do we send them the good shit? No.
我們送他們什麼了? 谷子 有誰今天還吃谷子嗎?
What do we send them? Grain. Anybody here have grain today?
有誰看完這場要去吃"麥谷子"的嗎? (對比麥當勞)
Anybody going to 'McGrainies' after the show?
為什麼我們不能給別人送點好東西?
Why can't we send them the good shit?
為什麼我們不送點芝士條 送點洋蔥圈 送點小奶油蛋糕
Why can't we send some Cheez Doodles, some Funyuns, some Twinkies?
為什麼我們不直接給他們澆些肉汁呢?
Why can't we just pour some gravy on the people?
就弄一大桶肉汁 然後從直升機上澆下去 "來吧親"
Just get a big old vat of gravy and pour it out the helicopter. "There you go."
"快來喝 喝點肉汁"
"Drink up. Have some gravy."
那人家就會說 "哦 我愛美國"
People going, "Oh, I love America!"
"都給我們下肉汁雨啦!"
"It's raining gravy!"
媽的 給人家弄點小皇堡嘛(漢堡王的) 不就99僊嘛
Shit, give them a Whopper, it's only 99 cents.
艸 我們自己號稱人道主義者
Shit, we call ourselves humanitarians,
然後把50磅的麻袋往40磅的人身上丟
meanwhile we're dropping 50-pound sacks on 40-pound people.
但是我愛美國 我們在美國有很多自由
But I love America, man. We got a lot of freedom in America.
比如 墮胎是合法的 給力伐 墮胎合法
For instance, abortion's legal. It's beautiful that abortion's legal, man.
我就喜歡去墮胎聯誼會去找妹子
I love going to abortion rallies to pick up women.
因為你知道她們好上啊
Cos you know they'll fuck you.
想在那裏找幾個處女那你真想多了
You ain't gonna find a bunch of virgins at the abortion rally.
倒可能給你逮著幾個穿透明高跟的!
You might even see some clear heels!
"小妞你來這兒幹嘛呢?" "又搞砸了唄" 
"What you doing here, girl?" "Fucked up again."
墮胎這個話題 屬於女性內部話題
The abortion issue, it's a woman's issue.
如果一個女人懷了孕 她不想聽她男人說一個字
A woman gets pregnant, she don't wanna hear shit from the man.
"去你MD 沒你的事 你給我滾"
"Fuck you, I don't need you, motherfuck you."
但一旦她決定生下那孩子 她就會 "我的支票吶?"
Unless she decides to have the baby. Then she's like, "Where's my cheque?"
當一個女人懷孕了
When a woman gets pregnant,
是生還是墮 就是由這女人和她的姐妹決定的
it's a choice between the woman and her girlfriends.
這女人一懷孕 她就和她姐妹去碰頭
A woman gets pregnant, her and her girlfriends get together,
然後弄一個墮胎裁決
and they have a little abortion tribunal,
像"倖存者"節目裏一樣
Survivor 外國真人秀 將一組人置於野外 一周後由觀眾投票淘汰表現最差選手
and they vote on the baby like it's Survivor.
然後每個女人投個2分錢 一個說 "姑娘 你要把這孩子生下來"
Each girlfriend puts in her two cents. One goes, "Child, you should have that baby."
"那男人的頭髮不錯啊 多卷啊 多卷啊"
"That man got some good hair, it's wavy, it's wavy."
另一個女人會說 "我們為什麼要討論這些?"
The other girlfriend goes, "Why are we talking about this?"
"我們下禮拜還去不去坎昆了? 快弄掉這個孩子!"
"Ain't we going to Cancun next week? Get rid of that baby!"
在美國 生命就是這樣被主宰的
And that's how life is decided in America.
好各位 如果你把一個女人肚子搞大了 你只能說兩樣東西
Now, fellas, if you get a woman pregnant, you're only allowed to say two things.
你猜怎麼著? 你都不能提到打胎
And guess what, fellas? You can't even suggest abortion.
你說到 "哆" 你已經走掉了
If you say, "A", you fucked up.
你根本不能提打胎的事
You can't even suggest abortion.
你們想得到嗎? 你們都不該提打胎的事情
Guess what, guys? You don't wanna suggest abortion.
因為如果你暗示去打胎 但她把小孩生下來了
If you suggest abortion and then she has the baby,
等那個小孩到了五六歲的時候
when that kid's about five, six years old,
他能罵得你屁滾尿流啊
he gonna be cursing yo ass out.
你說 "小鬼 最近怎麼樣啊? 幹什麼呢?"
You go, "What's up, little man? How you doing?"
"我活下來了 這TM就是我在做的事!"
"I'm alive, that's how the fuck I'm doing!"
"你想要弄死我 是嗎 混蛋?"
"You wanted me dead, huh, bitch?"
"我還活著 你個混蛋"
"I'm alive, motherfucker."
"我真應該往你*裏放一槍啊"
"I should bust a cap in yo ass."
你肯定不想經歷這個
You don't need that drama.
所以別提打胎的事
So do not suggest abortion.
好 哥們兒 如果你讓一個女人懷孕了
Now, fellas, if you get a woman pregnant,
你只能說兩句話
you only got two things to say.
兩種方法 供你挑選
Two ways to try it on.
第一種 你可以說 "哇 真不敢相信你懷孕了耶"
Now, the first thing you can say is, "Wow, I can't believe you're pregnant."
"我太高興了 我都等不及這個寶寶的降臨了 我太愛你了"
"I'm so happy. I can't wait for you to have this baby. I love you so much."
我們再來一遍 "哇 真不敢相信你懷孕了"
I'll try it again. "Wow, I can't believe that you're pregnant."
"我真太高興了 我都等不及要這個寶寶了"
"I'm so happy. I can't wait to have this baby."
"我真太愛你了"
"I love you so much."
這樣很好
That's cool.
但 如果你不願意這麼說 那你只剩一個選擇了
Now, if you don't wanna say that, you got one more choice.
你女人走進房間 告訴你她懷孕了
A woman walks in the room, tells you that she's pregnant,
你直直地看著她的眼睛 然後說...
you look her dead in the eye and you say...
"那你想怎麼辦?"
"So what you gonna do?"
嗯 很好 看來不止我一個人這麼邪惡
Ah, good, it ain't just me.
我對美國有一點特不滿意 那就是我們的藥物政策
One thing I don't like about America is we got real bad drug policy.
什麼狗屁藥物政策
Horrible drug policy.
有人嗑藥嗑high了就蹲班房了 就因為嗑high了哦
We got people in jail for getting high. For getting high, man.
多扯淡的事情啊
That's fucked up, man.
政府說嗑藥是違法的 因為他們要保護社會
The Government says drugs are illegal because we're trying to protect society.
但他們才不管你的安全勒
But they don't give a fuck about yo safety,
他們在沃爾瑪裏面賣槍 他們把你當回事兒?
they sell guns at Wal-Mart, they don't give a fuck about you.
政府其實是這樣的...
No, the Government's like this...
他們不想你去嗑你的藥 他們是希望你去嗑他們的藥
they don't want you to use your drugs, they want you to use their drugs.
所以每天晚上 你都能在電視上看到些莫名其妙的藥品廣告
So every night on TV you see a weird-ass drug commercial
想要你嗑上他們賣的那點藥
trying to get you hooked on some legal shit.
他們就不停地列舉各種癥狀 直到你能對號入座 懂?
And they just keep naming symptoms till they get one that you fucking got, OK?
比如 "你難過嗎? 你寂寞嗎? 你有腳蘚嗎?"
It's like, "Are you sad? Are you lonely? You got athlete's foot?"
"你熱嗎? 你冷嗎? 你腫麼了? 這藥你得吃啊"
"Are you hot? Are you cold? What you got? You want this pill, huh, motherfucker."
"一定要吃"
"You got to take this pill."
他們都不說這藥是幹嘛的 就給你看一個騎馬背上的女人 或者一個泡浴缸裏的男人
They don't even tell you what the pill does. You see a lady on a horse or a man in the tub.
然後他們在邊上給你說各種癥狀
And they just keep naming symptoms.
"你抑鬱嗎? 你孤單嗎? 你牙疼嗎?" 什麼狗屁
"Are you depressed? Are you lonely? Do your teeth hurt?" What the fuck.
我有天都看到個廣告這樣說 "你會在晚上上床睡覺"
I saw a commercial the other day that said, "Do you go to bed at night"
"然後在早上醒過來嗎?"
"and wake up in the morning?"
哎呦我艸 這條被說中啦 這條兒我有啊
Oh, shit they got one. I got that.
我病了啊 這藥我得吃啊
I'm sick, I need that pill.
政府就是想讓你嗑上他們給的藥
The Government trying to get you hooked on some legal fucking shit.
這就是事實啊
And that's the truth, man.
可卡因和大麻在美國不合法 和你的安全沒半毛錢關係
The reason coke and weed are illegal in America don't got shit to do with yo safety.
可卡因和大麻在這裏不合法 就是因為
The reason that coke and weed are illegal in America
最好的可卡因和大麻不是咱美國國產的啊
is cos the best coke and weed ain't made in America.
如果他們能在這兒弄出點好貨
If they made the good shit here,
TM每個路口都能給你開個賣可卡因和大麻的店
there'd be a coke and weed restaurant on every fucking corner.
就是這樣 沒什麼星巴克了 都是"麻巴克"
That's right. Wouldn't be no Starbucks, it'd be Weedbucks.
沒麥當勞了 都變"麥可卡"了
McDonald's, McCokeald's.
嗯 給我來份開心樂園餐加一個"8號球" 謝謝
Uh, get me a Happy Meal and an eight-ball, thank you.
(8號球 一袋3.5克裝可卡因粉的俗稱)
卡卡圈坊沒了哦 只有"嗑嗑圈坊"了
Krispy Kreme, Kracky Kreme.
Krispy Kreme 卡卡圈坊
1937年在美國誕生的甜甜圈品牌
卡卡甜甜圈有多好我告訴你哦
That's how good Krispy Kreme doughnuts are.
它們好吃得 如果我告訴你裏面摻了毒品
They're so good, if I told you right now they had crack in it,
你會說 "我就知道有問題"
you'd go, "I knew something was up."
"我就知道 這些甜甜圈太TM好吃了"
"I knew. These doughnuts are too damn good, man."
"害得我早上兩點敲他們店的窗戶"
"Got me knockin' on the doughnut window at two in the morning."
"拜託了 哥們兒 開個門啊"
"Come on, man, open up, man."
"再給我一個甜甜圈吧! 叫我做什麼都行啊!"
"Give me one more doughnut! I'll do anything!"
"我舔你老二啊!"
"I'll suck your dick!"
這沒準都能做卡卡圈坊的新廣告詞了
That should be the new slogan for Krispy Kreme.
卡卡圈坊 - 味美香甜 值你一舔
Krispy Kreme - so good you'll suck a dick.
這甜甜圈真尼瑪好吃啊 要是你小孩偷吃這個你肯定得毛
These are some good-ass doughnuts. You'd be mad if your kid ate your doughnuts.
"小鬼 你知道我為買這些都幹了什麼嗎?"
"Boy, you know what I had to do to get them doughnuts?"
"趕緊把我的甜甜圈放下"
"Now leave my fucking doughnuts along."
"害得我又得出去給別人吹簫了"
"Now I gotta go out and suck some more dick for doughnuts."
"媽的 小屁孩永遠不會懂"
"Kids will never learn, shit."
不 政府永遠不會讓毒品合法化
No, man, the Government, they will never legalize drugs in America.
他們這樣做的第一個原因
OK, the first reason they will never legalize drugs in America
是政府靠把咱黑人的兄弟姐妹扔進班房
is because the Government makes way too much money
能賺上好大一票啊 這是第一點
putting our brothers and sisters in fucking jail. That's first of all.
就TM為點雞毛蒜皮的事情
For bullshit.
不讓毒品合法化的第二個原因
The second reason the Government will never legalize drugs in America
就是不能讓棕色人種富起來 
is because, God forbid, some brown people got wealthy.
他們富起來了不行啊 因為毒品都是他們那些國家產的
Can't have that. Cos drugs come from brown countries.
他們要富了我們絕對不點頭
We can't have wealthy brown people.
美國沒有黑米人 或棕米人
There are no wealthy black - or brown - people in America.
有米的有幾個 但米人絕對沒有 
We got some rich ones, we don't got no fucking wealth.
人們會說 "有米和米人有毛區別?" 區別是這個
People go, "What's the difference?" Here's the difference.
奧尼爾(NBA球星) 那叫有米
Shaq is rich.
給他開支票的白人 那叫米人
The white man that signs his cheque is wealthy.
"喏 奧尼爾 你的支票 給自己買輛跳跳車吧"
"Ah, here you go, Shaq. Go buy yourself a bouncing car."
"記得配亮晶晶的輪轂哦!"
"Bling-bling!"
我說的不是有點小米 我說的是米人 懂不?
I'm not talking 'bout rich, I'm talking 'bout wealth, OK?
我說的是那些控股雅培奶粉的白人 那些有錢的混蛋
I'm talking about the white family that owns all the Similac. Those rich motherfuckers.
我說的是那些控股蒂芙尼珠寶的白人 那些有錢的混蛋
I'm talking about the white family that owns the color blue. Those rich bastards.
我沒說Oprah 我在說比爾蓋茨 知道嗎?
Oprah 著名脫口秀女王 主持人 當今最有影響力的黑人婦女之一
I ain't talking 'bout Oprah, I'm talking 'bout Bill Gates, OK?
如果比爾蓋茨明早醒來 發現自己的錢和Oprah一樣多了
If Bill Gates woke up tomorrow with Oprah's money
他TM能直接從窗口跳下去啊
he'd jump out a fucking window.
他一邊往下掉還一邊割自己喉啊 "我 艸"
He'd slit his throat on the way down. "Ah, shit."
"哥飛機的油都加不了了"
"I can't even put gas in my plane."
我不是在說有米 我在說的是米人
I'm not talking 'bout rich, I'm talking 'bout wealth.
因為米多了我們就自由了啊 是不是?
Cos wealth will set us fucking free, OK?
有錢能使鬼推磨啊
Cos wealth is empowering.
變米人了我們就能消除貧困社區了啊
Wealth can uplift communities from poverty.
一個白人變米人了
A white man gets wealthy,
他會蓋個沃爾瑪 讓其他白人過來拉點米
he builds Wal-Marts and makes other white people have some motherfucking money.
一個老黑變米人了 他TM就去買點首飾珠寶 是不是?
A brother gets rich, he buys some motherfucking jewelry, OK?
你們TM懂我的意思? 
Do you know what the fuck I'm talking 'bout?
我說的不是有點小米 我說的是米人
I ain't talking 'bout rich, I'm talking 'bout wealth.
米人的米 是能代代相傳的
Wealth is passed down from generation to generation.
那些米你都甭想甩掉
You can't get rid of wealth.
小米是你度個假嗑個藥立馬就能沒了的
Rich is some shit you can lose with a crazy summer and a drug habit.
艸 Rick James多有錢啊
Fuck, Rick James was rich.
(Rick James 80年代最紅的藝人之一)
前一秒還唱Super Freak 下一秒你就在拍Old Navy休閒服廣告了
前者是1981年熱門單曲 後者為美低檔服裝品牌
One minute you're singing Super Freak, the next you're doing Old Navy commercials.
"快給我 寶貝! 我要燈芯絨!"
"Give it to me, baby! Give me corduroy!"
("Give it to me baby" Rick James另一首熱門單曲)
我不在說有米 我在說米人
Not talking 'bout rich, I'm talking 'bout wealth.
別誤解哦 黑人和棕色人做不了米人
Don't get me wrong, it's not all white people's fault
也不全是白人的錯
that black and brown people don't have any fucking wealth.
也許... 也許哦...
Maybe... now just maybe...
咱不把錢都砸輪轂上 或許還能攢上一點...
maybe if we didn't spend all our money on rims we might have some...
(輪轂 車輪承載輪胎的部分 通常被改裝)
拿去投資
to invest.
我們才不管呢
We don't give a fuck, boy.
我們黑人最愛改輪轂了
Black people, we love rims.
不管什麼破車我們都肯給它換個閃瞎你狗眼的輪轂
We will put shiny-ass rims on any piece of shit car in the world.
我們才不管
We don't give a fuck.
沒人攔著的話 麵包機我們也能給它上個輪轂
A brother would put rims on a toaster if you'd let him.
"你看看你看看 這麵包機給我安了22寸的輪轂啊"
"Yo, man, I got some raisin toast sittin' on 22s."
"22寸哦! 這個閃亮亮啊 你看看!"
"22s! Look at the motherfuckers, look at 'em!"
"這一轉 你看這閃得啊! "
"And they spinning, look at they spinning! ''
"這一轉 那個閃啊!"
"They spinning, look at they spinning!"
我們才不管呢 錢這玩意兒對黑人那叫一個稀罕啊
We don't give a fuck. Money's new to black people.
我們能算地球表面最浪費錢的哺乳動物了
We the most money-wasting motherfuckers on the face of the earth.
好像錢在手裏不花會爛掉一樣
We spend money like we think the shit's gonna rot.
咱黑哥開著車到處晃 頭靠背後裝著電視
Brothers riding around with TVs in the headrests of the car.
電視開著 尼瑪後座一個人都沒有
The TVs is on and ain't nobody in the back seat.
我沒說有米 我在說米人
I ain't talking 'bout rich, I'm talking 'bout wealth.
說起發大財
Now, when it comes to acquiring a fortune,
尤其是在美國發大財
when it comes to acquiring wealth in the United States of America,
大家各闢蹊徑
different people have gone about it in different ways.
有個關於財富和金錢的諺語
There's a saying about wealth, there's a saying about fortunes,
是這樣說的 "每一份金錢背後 都沾滿了鮮血與罪惡"
and the saying is, "Behind every great fortune there's a great crime."
美國一些最有錢有權的人
And some of the richest, most powerful people in the United States
都是些毒販子的後代
are the descendants of drug dealers.
肯尼迪家族 布羅克曼家族 賺的都是毒品錢
Kennedys, Brockmans, it's all drug money.
他們說是賣私貨 這只不過是白人圈裏販毒的說法
They call it bootlegging but that's just a white word that means drug dealing.
賣的不是其他貨 賣的就是當時的毒品
They didn't sell boots, they sold the crack of their day.
他們殺條子殺孩子 好得很 沒問題
They killed cops and kids, and that's cool, good for them.
但當別人想賺錢發財的時候
When it's time for other people to come up and acquire wealth
遊戲規則就變了
the rules change.
在美國要發財的一大遊戲規則是這樣的
One of the number one rules in America when it comes to acquiring wealth goes like this.
就是 只有白人能從別人的痛苦中獲益 
The rule is, only the white man can profit from pain.
只有白人能這樣
Only the white man can profit from pain.
如果你是黑人或棕色人種 你可以在美國脫個貧 致個富 奔個小康
So if you're black or brown, you can make money and prosper and get rich in America.
但不管你做什麼 最好能積極向上點
But whatever you decide to do, it better be positive.
因為如果你發跡的時候有人受了傷害 那你就玩完了 懂?
Cos if one person is harmed, you will be destroyed, OK?
你看現在Oprah每晚在節目裏撒錢
Every now and then Oprah has a show where she's just giving away money.
圖個啥? 就圖FBI不要跟在自己屁股後面
You know why? She's trying to keep the Feds off her back.
只有白人能從別人的痛苦中獲益 懂?
Only the white man can profit from pain, OK?
白人給你造酒 這酒好喝呀 我愛 你愛 大家愛
White man makes alcohol, tastes great, I love it, you love it, we all love it.
每天都TM害死人 是不是?
Kills motherfuckers every single day, OK?
在場的各位今晚就可能因為喝了兩杯 永遠回不了家了
Some of you all ain't even gonna make it home tonight cos of alcohol.
開車回家 邊開邊說 "Chris Rock這場真逗啊"
Gonna be driving home, "That Chris Rock show is funny."
"誒呦 我艸!"
"Oh, shit!"
但白白惹人愛 一切無大礙
But it's all right cos it's all white.
白人給你捲煙 香煙能算人類歷史上最有殺傷力的產品了
White man makes cigarettes. Cigarettes are the most dangerous product known to man.
每天都TM害死人
Kills motherfuckers every fucking day.
香煙危險啊 不抽的也能給它弄死咯!
Cigarettes are so dangerous, it kills motherfuckers that don't smoke!
哎 就有這麼危險 
That's how fucking dangerous cigarettes are. That's right.
一手煙 二手煙 抽的人跟別人講話都這種聲音...
First-hand smoke, second-hand smoke, people talking out in their next into machines like...
"嗨 哥們兒 最近怎麼樣? "
"Hey, what's up, man? "
"我喜歡煙啊 這貨真TM好啊"
"I love cigarettes. This shit is good."
但白白惹人愛 一切無大礙
But it's all right cos it's all white.
艸 你想一下 如果Philip Morris家族
世界第一大私營捲煙生產公司 萬寶路就他們家的
Shit, could you imagine if the Philip Morris family
是一群密西西比來的卷毛黑鬼嗎?
was a bunch of jeri-curled niggers from Mississippi?
你知道一包煙能判幾年嗎?
Do you know how illegal a pack of cigarettes would be?
一包Newport牌夠你蹲60年啊
You would get 60 years for a pack of Newports.
但白白惹人愛 一切無大礙嘛
But it's all right cos it's all white. That's right.
白人造槍 沒人管
White man makes guns, nobody gives a fuck.
白人造槍 小孩子帶槍去學校火拚 沒人管啊
White man makes guns, kids shoot up each other in schools, nobody gives a fuck.
白人造槍 沒問題
White man makes guns, no problem.
黑人饒舌歌手唱到"槍" 字
Black rapper says "gun",
尼瑪國會聽證啊
Congressional hearing.
(美國國會會對重大事件當事人進行調查聽證)
"我艸 那黑鬼說了槍啊! "
Like, "Oh, my God, that nigger said gun!"
"這韻腳押得歡啊! "
"And he rhymed it with fun!"
美國就這樣招人恨了...
And that's why people hate America...
虛偽的民主啊 是不是?
the hypocrisy of our democracy, OK?
討厭美國的就是這個
That's why they hate America.
但我告訴你們
But let me tell you right now,
人家討厭美國的首要原因
the number one reason people hate America,
首要原因 是我們的信仰
the number one reason, is because of our religion.
美國人崇拜金錢
Americans worship money.
我們崇拜金錢
We worship money.
學校 企業 政府 都不談宗教
Separate God from school, separate God from work, separate God from Government,
但鈔票上印著"我們信賴上帝" 
but on your money it says, "In God we trust".
眾裏尋他千百度 他就在我口袋住啊
All my life I've been looking for God and he's right in my pocket.
美國人崇拜金錢
Americans worship money.
然後我們都去同一個教堂做禮拜
And we all go to the same church
就是ATM教堂
the church of ATM.
你隨便看看 這裏又新開了個分行
Everywhere you look, there's a new branch popping up,
時刻提醒你多有錢 你多沒錢
reminding you about how much money you got or how much money you don't got.
如果卡裏沒有20塊 連那機器都不甩你啊
And if you got less than $20, the machine won't even talk to you.
就像在說"你還是見櫃員去吧"
The machine's like, "You better go see a teller."
你們有誰去櫃檯就為了取八塊五?
You ever go to a teller and try to take out $8.50?
這TM丟人啊
Oh, it's disgusting.
艸 你站在那個長長的隊伍後面
Oh, man, you gotta wait on that long-ass line.
你前面的人各種大筆地轉賬
People doing real transactions in front of you.
你走到那該死的櫃檯門前 填好表
You get up to the fucking front, fill out your form.
"取8塊5"
"Eight-fifty."
那櫃員看了看單子 看了看你 再看看那張單子
The fucking teller looks at it, she looks at you, she looks at the chit.
她TM都不開抽屜 直接往自己口袋裏掏啊
She don't even take the money out the drawer, she take it out her pocket.
"TM浪費我時間 妹的拿了錢快滾"
"Wastin' my time. Get the fuck outta here, shit."
我覺得每個銀行都應該在門口放個零錢罐
I think every bank should have a box of ones by the door
可憐可憐那些破了產的客戶
for they broke-ass customers.
"我不要手續費全免 我要午飯錢啊"
"I don't need free checking, I need lunch money."
"給我弄碗肉丁炒飯嘛"
"Trying to buy me some pork fried rice, man."
還有個事兒哦
Here's the other thing, man.
毒品不合法 ATM卻24小時服務
Drugs are illegal but ATM machines are open 24 hours a day.
24小時哎 為誰服務啊?
24 hours a day. For who?
這TM在為誰開著?
Who the fuck is it open for?
有誰在凌晨四點 去取三百塊
Have you ever taken out $300 at four o'clock in the morning
是為了幹正事兒嗎?
for something positive?
艸 你凌晨四點按那機器的時候
Shit, when you press that machine at four o'clock in the morning,
屏幕上應該蹦出個精神病專家 說"行了哥們兒"
I think a psychiatrist should pop up on the screen and go, Come on, man."
"省點錢嘛"
"Save your money, man."
"別買毒品了 買點輪轂"
"Don't buy drugs, buy some rims."
"這一轉 你看這閃瞎了啊! "
"They spinnin', look at they spinnin'! They spinnin'! "
"這一轉 你看這閃瞎了啊! "
"They spinnin', look at they spinnin'! "
美國人崇拜金錢
Americans worship money.
知道銀行為啥禮拜天關門嗎?
Shit, you know why banks are closed on Sunday?
因為不關門就沒人去教堂了啊
Cos if they wasn't church'd be empty.
但我愛美國 各位 我必須說 我愛美國
Now, I love America, man, I must say. I love America.
我得說美國是這個世界上最偉大的國家
I got to say, America is the greatest country in the world, OK?
世界上最偉大的國家
It's the greatest country in the world.
放眼全球 咱們甲天下
In the whole world. It's the best place.
我只願在這兒生 在這兒長
There's no place I'd rather be or be from.
能在美國的人都很幸運 在場的各位 都很幸運
And we are all lucky to be here. Everybody in this room, lucky to be here.
就算是黑人 也很幸運
Even black people, lucky to be here.
但你要是黑人 你對美國的看法得有那麼一丁點兒不同
But if you black, you gotta look at America a little different.
如果你是黑人 美國就像一路供你進大學的叔叔
If you black, America's like the uncle that paid your way through college
但性騷擾你
but molested you.
要學會原諒 對不? 要學會原諒啊
Oh, you gotta forgive, right? You gotta forgive.
知道美國現在最大的爭議是什麼嗎? 在美國最大的爭議
What's the biggest issue in America right now? The most divisive issue in America
就是平權法案
聯邦和州政府在法律上禁止對膚色 宗教 性別或種族不同的人進行就業歧視
is affirmative action.
很多人覺得它是針對60年代黑人公車只能坐後排 午餐和白人分開坐 不是的
A lot of people think it's to do with the '60s, the back of the bus, separate lunch counters. No.
你看60年代的片子 看到黑人被高壓水槍噴 被壓迫
When you see footage of the '60s, see black people, see us getting sprayed down, and holds down
狗都不正眼瞧我們 小姑娘在教堂裏被點了燒
dogs getting sicked on us, little girls getting burnt up in churches,
這算白人對我們客氣的了
that's just white people being nice.
比30 40 50年代那會兒客氣多了
Nicer than they was in the '50s, '40s, and '30s.
要有個死在30年代的黑人
Shit, there's black people that died in the '30s
在天堂裏看60年代的事 他會說"那些黑鬼福氣啊"
that was looking down from heaven in the '60s going, "Man, them niggers got it good."
歧視早就有了 平權法案是用來消除美國政府
No, no, no. Affirmative action was put into place to offset policies
奴隸時期通過的 至今還影響著我們的
that the United States Government implemented during slavery
政策法案的
that affect us today.
我說奴隸時期 是說黑人們什麼權利都沒有
When I talk about slavery, I'm just talking about a period of time
的那段時間
where black people had no rights.
說的大概是從17世紀
So you're talking about the 1600s
到1964年 (那年美國黑人享有了完全投票權)
to about 1964.
可能有一年的偏差 取決於你那片兒啥時候從的良
You know, give or take a year, depending on when your town decided to act right.
人們會問 "奴隸制的什麼事情現在還會影響我們? "
People go, "What happened during slavery that could affect us today? "
到現在還影響著我們的 奴隸制時期的事情多了去了
A lot of shit happened during slavery that affects us every day.
比如 在奴隸制時期 白人們會選出最強壯的奴隸們來交配
For instance, during slavery, they used to take the biggest, strongest slaves and breed them
極盡所能培育超強壯的奴隸 知道不?
and try their best to make big, strong super-slaves, OK?
就是這樣 這事情至今有據可查
That's right. And there's evidence of that today.
比如NFL 
Like the NFL, for instance.
National Football League 美國國家橄欖球聯盟
NFL就是指"黑鬼TM壯"
NFL stands for Nigger Fucking Large.
他們給黑奴配種 所以現在黑人們稱霸美國
They bred the slaves, and this is why black people dominate every physical activity
所有的體育運動
in the United States of America.
我們只佔總人口的10% 卻佔了四強賽裏的90% 知道不?
We're only 10% of the population, we're 90% of the Final Four, OK?
這些運動我們都稱霸了啊 不是嗎?
We fucking dominate all this shit, OK?
籃球 棒球 橄欖球
Basketball, baseball, football,
拳擊 田徑 甚至還有高爾夫和網球
boxing, track, even golf and tennis.
要是他們造得出暖和的冰上曲棍球場 那事兒我們照樣能給擺平咯
As soon as they make a heated hockey rink, we gonna take that shit too.
什麼狗屁Wayne Gretzky
(美白人冰上曲棍球球員)
Motherfuck Wayne Gretzky.
你坐等詹姆斯踩著冰刀啊
(勒布朗·詹姆斯 NBA著名球星)
Wait till you see Lebron on some skates.
你都沒來得及反應哦
You ain't seen shit yet.
他只要一腳穿冰鞋 超淡定 "怎麼樣? "
He just gonna have one skate, chilling, "What's up? "
球棍都用不著 直接用他老二就打了哦 啪!
He ain't gonna have a stick. He gonna smack the puck with his dick. Pow!
一次強打哦親!
Slapshot bi-atch!
(bi-atch比bitch更具黑人氣質)
他們就這樣對強壯的黑奴的
So that's what they did to the big, strong slaves.
你猜他們怎麼對聰明的黑奴?
And you know what they did to the smart ones?
或者白人覺得聰明的黑奴 他們TM殺了人家啊 就是這樣
Or at least the ones they thought were smart. They killed them. That's what they did.
沒錯 這就是那時美國政府的政策
That's right. That was the policy of the United States Government,
殺掉聰明的黑人 就這樣
to kill smart black people. That's right.
所以真正聰明的黑奴就得裝傻
So the real smart motherfuckers had to hide the fact that they were smart.
當時的法律是 你要能讀書 就死定了
The law of the land was, if you read, you die.
你能讀書 你他媽死定了 明白嗎?
If you read, you fucking die, OK?
什麼意思呢? 最早的黑人毒販都不販毒
So you know what that means? The first black drug dealers didn't even sell drugs.
TM都販書啊
They sold books.
"喲 哥們兒 我搞了兩頁書啊 來看看 兩頁書喔"
"Yo, man, I got two pages, man, got two pages, man, check it out, man."
"喲 哥們兒 我這有個生詞哦 來看看"
"Yo, man, I got a word, check it out, man, I got a new word."
"我這有個生詞啊 新的哦"
"I got a new word, man. It's new, man."
想想那些明明識字還得裝傻的苦逼奴隸們
So think about the poor slaves that could read but had to hide it.
想想那些自己識字
Think about the poor slaves that could read
卻不敢教孩子認字 怕害死他們的苦逼奴隸們 
but was scared to teach they kids to read for fear they'd be killing their kids.
想想那些天天駕馬車進城的苦逼奴隸們 
Think about the poor slave who used to drive the buggy into town every day.
一直駕著馬車 他駕著馬車 駕著駕著...
Used to drive the buggy. He's driving the buggy, driving the buggy...
他還識字... 他駕著駕著駕著
and he could read... he's driving the buggy.
他看見不遠處 有個車水馬龍的十字路口 他駕著駕著駕著...
And up ahead he sees a real busy intersection. He's driving the buggy...
然後他看到一個停車標誌...
And then he sees a stop sign...
現在夠他糾結的了
Now he's got a real dilemma.
"哦 上帝啊"
"Oh, Lor"
"我咋辦啊? "
"what is I gon' do? "
"哦 上帝 我該咋辦啊? "
"Oh, Lor, what is I gon' do? "
"好吧 如果我要穿這個路口"
"OK, if I go across this intersection"
"肯定人仰馬翻"
"I'm-a have a accident."
"如果我停在這個標誌前 那幫逼樣的會殺了我"
"If I stop at this sign, these crackers'll kill me."
"哦 上帝啊 我該咋辦啊? "
"Oh, Lor, what is I gon' do? "
他不知道咋辦 他駕著馬車
And he don't know. And he's riding the buggy.
緊急關頭 他說"去他的" 就衝進了那十字路口
And at the last minute, he says, "Fuck it," and goes through the intersection.
果然出了一場大事故 人仰馬翻
He has a big old accident, wipes out. 
全散架了 差點鬧出人命 警察來了
Wipes out, almost kills somebody. And the police come.
"黑鬼 你搞毛啊? 你TM搞毛啊? "
"Nigger, what's wrong with you? What the fuck is wrong with you? "
"你差點害死人啊 黑鬼 沒看到停車標誌嗎? "
"You could've killed somebody, nigger. You see that stop sign? "
"呃 長官 我不知道你在說什麼"
"Uh, I don't know what you talking 'bout, sir."
"黑鬼 你沒看到停車標誌嗎 就在那兒? "
"Nigger, you see that stop sign right there? "
"呃 你是說那個八邊形的東西嗎? "
"Uh, do you mean that octagon thing? "
"黑鬼 誰教你說'八邊形' 的? "
"Nigger, who taught you 'octagon'? "
別誤會我說的平權法案
Don't get me wrong with affirmative action.
我不是說我考分沒白人高 政府也要把工作讓給我
I don't think I should get a job over a white person if I get a lower mark in a test.
我不是說我考得沒白人好 學校也要優先錄取我
I don't think I should get accepted into a school over a white person if I get a lower mark in a test.
但要是考分一樣 去你的白人
But if there's a tie, fuck 'em.
小樣 你們比我早讀400年書啊
Shit, you had a 400-year head start, motherfucker.
但白人們 你們ok的
White man, you gonna be all right.
很多人說 "如果你是最聰明機靈的人"
You know, a lot of people say, "If you're the smartest and the brightest,"
"你就不需要平權法案 如果你努力變聰明變機靈 你都用不著它"
"you won't need affirmative action, would be able to get rid of the affirmative action altogether, if you strive to be the smartest and the brightest."
他們這麼說 好像美國是被最聰明機靈的人統治著
They say that as if the country is run by the smartest and the brightest.
黑人和白人的學校我都待過 所以你別跟我JB扯
I was in black schools and white schools so you can't tell me shit.

You're never gonna get a soul mate, you never gonna meet the perfect person.
你不會找到那誰 又喜歡看宋飛傳(情景喜劇) 又喜歡聽Hip Hop
You're never gonna meet somebody that loves Seinfeld and the Wu Tang Clan.
想都別想
It ain't happening.
即使你地利人和碰到了那個完美的TA 天不時啊
Even if you meet the perfect person, it ain't gonna be the perfect time.
他們單身 你已經結婚了
You're married, they're single.
他們是巴勒斯坦的 你是以色列的
That's right. You're Jewish, they're Palestinian.
你是墨西哥人 他們是浣熊
You're Mexican, they're a raccoon.
你是黑人女人 他是黑人男人
You're a black woman, he's a black man.
總有一道跨不過去的坎的
There's always a obstacle in the way.
別指望找到完美的TA 不會有的事情
You're never gonna meet the perfect person, it's never gonna happen, OK?
有時候 上帝就是喜歡捉弄我們
Every now and then, God likes to play practical jokes on people.
他會安排你們兩口子 和一對完美組合一起出去
God will send you on a double date with the perfect couple.
有誰和這樣的一對兒一起出去過沒?
You ever been out with the perfect couple?
有沒有犯過這種傻 和這樣真正相愛的一對兒在一起?
Ever made the mistake of going on a double date with a couple that's actually in love?
你TM還陷在你那狗屎一樣的感情裏面
You in the middle of your bullshit relationship.
然後你們兩個和那倆卿卿我我的人坐一起
And you sit down with two people that's in love.
你都沒法把飯嚥下去 因為你不敢相信你目睹的一切啊
You can't even eat your food cos you can't believe what the fuck you are witnessing.
你握著個叉子 心裏想 "我勒個去啊"
You got a fork in your hand, you're like, "Oh, shit."
"他居然真的在聽她說的話啊"
"He's really listening to what she's got to say."
"哇靠 他們真的喜歡和對方在一起啊"
"Wow. They really like being around each other."
"不能再跟他們一起混了 要害我們分手的!"
"Man, we can't hang with them no more. They gonna break us up!"
"可不能叫這些人毀了我的小日子 沒門!"
"Can't let these happy motherfuckers fuck up my life. No way!"
吶 碰到感情這方面的變故 我們男人總會被弄個措手不及
See, the thing is, men, we are ill-prepared when it comes to relationships.
措手不及啊 沒錯
We are ill-prepared. That's right.
你也許會覺得現在 是女人在主宰世界
You would think by now women would rule the world.
覺得現在是女人在主宰世界 但其實不然!
You would think women would rule the world. But they don't!
不是她們 知道為什麼?
They don't. You know why?
因為女人恨女人
Cos women hate women.
女人恨女人啊
Women hate women.
千真萬確
You do.
隨便找在座的兩個要好的女的 25年的閨蜜
You get any two girlfriends in this room, been girlfriends for 25 years,
在她們中間塞個男的 "去她個逼樣的" "去她個逼樣的"
you put a man in between them, "Fuck that bitch." "Fuck that bitch."
女人恨女人啊
Women hate women.
我們男人呢 會去惦記籃子裏別的菜
Guys are not like that. Guys actually think there's other fish in the sea.
要是一男的把他妹子帶給他哥們兒看
If a guy introduces his boy to his new girlfriend,
這倆走掉之後 他哥們兒會說 "誒呦 這妹子靈啊 我也要給自己找個這樣的"
when they walk away, his boy goes, "Oh, man, she's nice. I gotta get me a girl like that."
要是一個女的 把她新男友帶給她閨蜜看
If a woman introduces her new man to her girlfriend,
等他倆一走 她閨蜜會說
when they walk away, her girlfriend goes,
"我要拿下他"
"I gotta get him."
"然後要我割了這B的喉嚨我也肯"
"And I will slit that bitch's throat to do it."
艸 每個女的都有這樣一個閨蜜 堅決不能讓她見到自己男人
Shit, every woman in here got a girlfriend they don't trust around they man.
再要好也沒用 "跟她一起軋馬路好得很"
A good girlfriend too. "I'll go shopping with her"
"但把她跟我男人放一起 就算只待5分鐘 想都別想"
"but I ain't gonna leave that bitch with my man for five minutes."
我記得 一次我在外面吃飯
I remember one time, one time I was in a restaurant,
我 我老婆 她閨蜜
me, my wife, her girlfriend.
我老婆說 "我要上廁所" 我說 "哦 我等你回來"
My wife said, "I'm going to the bathroom." I say, "OK, I'll see you when you get back."
她說 "不 你跟我走"
She said, "No, you coming with me."
她叫我跟著她去上廁所啊
And she made me come with her.
我說她做得好 不然我已經把她閨蜜給上了
And she did the right thing cos I'd have fucked the girl.
把她按在玉米餅上干也好啊 我管這麼多
I'd have fucked her on the quesadilla, I don't give a fuck.
真的哦 但各位 我發現了一件事
Nah, man. But one thing I learned, man,
一旦你結了婚 各位 你女人就會想掌控你所有的幸福
once you get married, fellas, women wanna be responsible for all your happiness.
你所有的幸福 聽見沒?
All your happiness. You got that?
不是一部分 是全部
Not some of it. All of it.
各位 有誰在打飛機的時候被老婆逮著過嗎?
Fellas, you ever have your woman catch you jerking off?
有誰在打飛機的時候被老婆逮著過嗎?
Ever have your woman catch you jerking off?
她發火沒 儘管她都沒打算把你上了?
Did she get mad at you, even though she wasn't thinking about fucking you?
告訴你為什麼 你打飛機她才不生氣勒
Here's the real deal, she ain't mad you was jerking off.
她生氣 是因為你自己讓自己爽了
She's mad you was making yourself happy.
"你怎麼敢自說自話讓自己爽了?"
"How dare you make yourself fucking happy?"
"這屋子裏的幸福都歸我管 沒我點頭你只有苦逼的份"
"I'm in charge of happiness in this house. You'll be miserable till I fucking say so."
"把手給我從兜裏伸出來! "
"Take your hands out yo pockets! "
還有一件事 女人還有一件事
Another thing with women, one thing about women,
她們討厭你把什麼事情都當理所當然
women hate for you to expect anything.
別期望任何東西
Don't expect shit.
一女人能天天做飯 做五年
A woman can cook for you every day for five years.
每天都把飯菜端上桌
Every day food is on the table,
每一天的7點49分
every day at 7:49, every day.
一天你回家了 桌上沒菜
The day you come home, there ain't no food,
你好好地問了句 "老婆 菜呢?"
and you ask nicely, "Honey, where's the food?"
"我TM是你傭人嗎?"
"What am I, your fuckin' maid?"
"要會給自己燒飯知道嗎 你個SB"
"You need to learn how to cook for yourself, you stupid motherfucker."
所以各位 為了避免這種尷尬情況的發生
So, fellas, in order to avoid this,
你要做的是 無論她做了什麼 你都表現得超級乖
what you gotta do is act super-nice every time she does anything.
不管多小的事 堅決嚴肅對待
No matter how little it is, make a big deal out of it.
她給你倒杯水 你得說 "哇 水誒! "
If she pour you some water, you gotta go, "Wow, water! "
"我勒個去 你真棒極了! 太犀利了! "
"Get outta here. You're incredible! You're so smart! "
她TM疊個餐巾 "沃 看啊! 你真了不起! "
She fucking folds a napkin. "Wow, look at that! You're incredible."
對她得像對智障兒一樣啊 懂?
You gotta treat 'em like retarded kids, OK?
真的哦
Oh, man. That's right.
要麼結了婚無聊 要麼光著棍孤單
Married and bored, single and lonely.
沒錯 就是這樣 你要結婚了 你想把你對像做了
That's right, guys. Here's the thing... when you're married, you wanna kill your spouse.
你要光棍著 你想把自己做了
When you're single, you wanna kill yourself.
與其我不如她嘛
Better her than me.
在座任何一個結過婚的 都能為我這段話作證
Anybody in this room that's ever been in love will testify to this shit.
你要沒策劃過一個謀殺 你不算結過婚
If you haven't contemplated murder, you ain't been in love.
你要沒靜下心來 仔細想怎麼做掉那逼樣的
If you haven't seriously thought about killing the motherfucker,
你不算結過婚
you ain't been in love.
你要沒手裏拿著一罐毒鼠強
If you haven't had a can of rat poison in your hand
直盯盯地看個45分鐘 你不算結過婚
and looked at it for 45 minutes straight, you ain't been in love.
你要沒買過把鏟子 買個麻袋
If you haven't bought a shovel and a bag
還有一條把他們裹起來的毯子 你不算結過婚
and a rug to roll they ass up in, you ain't been in love.
你要沒在鏡子前面練過自己的不在場證明...
If you haven't practiced your alibi in front of the mirror...
你不算結過婚
you ain't been in love.
唯一讓你計劃破了產的
The only thing that stopped you from killing this motherfucker
是一集CSI啊
was an episode of CSI.
(CSI 熱播美劇 犯罪現場調查)
哎喲 他們這活做得那個細啊
Oh, man, they thorough.
我得好好準備啊 不然要被逮著的
I'd better make up, they might catch my ass.
是啊 所以婚姻是很艱苦的
That's right, man. See, relationships are hard.
但要維持婚姻的話 兩個人得在一個出發點上
But in order for any relationship to work, both people have to be on the same page.
兩個的焦點得在一起
Both people have to have the same focus.
我們都知道這個出發點在哪 這個焦點在哪
And we all know what that page is, what that focus is.
但要維持婚姻的話 兩個人的焦點得在一起
In order for the relationship to work, both people have to have the same focus,
這焦點是什麼? 就是她
And what's that focus? The focus is all about her.
就 是 她
It's all about her.
她已經在那裏了啊 坐等你上鉤啊
She's already there, fellas, she's waiting for you to come aboard.
各位 等你早上爬起來
Fellas, when you wake up in the morning,
你該照著鏡子對自己說 "去你媽的"
you should look yourself in the mirror and say, "Fuck you."
"去你MD希望 去你MD夢想 去你MD計劃"
"Fuck your hopes, fuck your dreams, fuck your plans,"
"對你所有生命裏的期待都說句去你MD"
"fuck everything you thought this life was gonna bring you."
"然後現在可以過去 博那逼樣的一笑了"
"Now let's go out there and try and make this bitch happy."
沒錯
Yes.
啥都圍她轉
It's all about her, fellas.
對啥都說好
Say yes to everything.
所有 所有你買得起的 都說好
Everything. Everything you can afford, say yes to.
只管說好 在她把話說完之前就說
Just say yes. Before she even gets it out of her fucking mouth.
"老公 我能不能..." 好 "老公我要..." 好 "老公 要不..." 好
"Honey, can I..." Yes. "Honey, I want..." "Honey, how 'bout... " Yes.
TM直接弄個圖章 好好好好...
Just get a stamp. Yes, yes...
各位 還有一件事... 別跟她們吵
Another thing, fellas... don't argue.
你沒戲的
You cannot win.
你不會吵得過一個女人的 不可能的事情
You cannot beat a woman in an argument, it's impossible.
贏不了的 因為... 男人都先天性吵架障礙啊
You will not win, cos men... we are handicapped when it comes to arguing
因為我們為的是把事情說通啊
cos we have a need to make sense.
女人吵架的時候才不跟你講道理
Women ain't gonna let a little thing like sense fuck up they argument.
因為她們吵才不為了這個 她們就是為了把你搞毛搞不爽
Cos she not in it for sense, she's in it for distance and irritation.
"我要吵多久這逼樣的才崩潰?"
"How long can I talk before this motherfucker snaps?"
你沒聽到警察來之前 她最好你把她頭都搖下來
They want you to shake the shit out of them till you hear the cops coming.
"草泥馬 我說真的!"
"Motherfucker, I'm serious!"
"我日 快逃"
"Oh, shit, let me get the fuck outta here."
沒錯 按我說的 你要盡你所能 討她開心
That's right. And like I said, try your best to make her happy.
盡你所能 但有一件是沒人會跟你講
Try your best. But here's one thing nobody tells you.
你是沒法讓一個女人開心的
You can't make a woman happy.
不可能的事情
It's impossible.
我就沒見過一個心滿意足的女人
I've never met a happy woman in my life.
她們總歸有事情能逼逼的
Women are always complaining about something.
她們就喜歡逼逼叨叨地 她們會把事情存到以後跟你逼逼
Women like to complain, women save up shit to complain about.
"他都不知道我知道了 我下個月再找他算賬"
"He don't even know I know but I'm gonna get his ass on that shit next month."
她們這喜歡逼逼啊 特喜歡
They like fucking complaining. They love it.
不過你怎麼做 她就是一個不爽
No matter what you do, she'll be mad.
你拿一個鑽石老二 讓這逼高潮10次
You can fuck a woman with a diamond dick and make her come ten times,
她還能給你不滿意
she'll still complain.
"幹嘛一直叫我高潮? "
"Why'd you make me come so hard? "
"這鑽石老二都不透了啊"
"This diamond dick is cloudy."
"怎麼不給我買個Tiffany的? 真TM小器"
"Why didn't you go to Tiffany's? You're so fucking cheap."
不管你怎麼做 她就是衝你不爽
No matter what you do, your woman is mad at you.
如果你一直上班 "你怎麼一直上班? 你都不在家裏的喏"
If you work all the time, "Why you work all the time? You ain't never home."
"你總是躲著我 去你MD"
"You always leavin' me. I hate this shit."
要是你一直在家裏 "你幹嘛一直跟著我? 給我點空間行不行"
If you home all the time, "Why you all up under me? Let me get some fucking room to breathe."
"艸 別跟我爆粗口 去你MD"
"Damn, stop sweatin' me. I hate this shit."
你要是賺得比她多 "去你MD 我也要做決定"
If you make more money than her. "Fuck you. I wanna make decisions too."
"你又不是我爸 用不著你照顧我"
"You ain't my fucking daddy, I don't need you to take care of me."
"去你MD"
"I hate this shit."
如果她賺得比你多
If she makes more money than you,
"你個窮逼"
"You broke motherfucker."
"你什麼時候有過點錢了 媽的"
"You never have no fucking money. Fuck this shit."
"為什麼總是我在做決定 我也要人照顧啊"
"I don't wanna make all these decisions. I need to be taken care of."
"去你MD 我受不了了"
"I hate this shit. I can't take it."
你女人永遠逼逼叨叨個沒完到底為什麼
And the number one reason your woman's always mad, fellas,
為毛 她總你看你不爽...
the number one reason your woman is pissed the fuck off...
因為你不是她的首選
cos you ain't her first choice.
各位 你們老婆有沒有愣愣地看著你
Fellas, you ever catch your woman just looking at you
卻一個字也不說?
but not saying nothing?
她腦子裏就在想 "我怎麼就攤上了這逼樣的? "
In her mind, she's thinking, "How did I end up with this ugly motherfucker? "
"天哪 這逼樣的又醜又二"
"Oh, Lord, this motherfucker's ugly and stupid."
"以前一挺好的追我 我給人家發了好人卡"
"I had a good man and I blew it."
"上帝 快弄死我老公 弄死他 拜託了"
"Damn, Lord, kill my man. Kill him, please."
"趁我還有點姿色 撩得到別的男人"
"Kill him while I still look good enough to get something new."
"現在就弄死他 劈死他! "
"Please kill this motherfucker now. Strike him! "
"上帝 如果你真在那兒 現在就劈死這逼樣的"
"If you out there, Lord, strike this motherfucker dead."
沒東西能讓你在結婚前準備好的
Nothing gets you ready for marriage, man.
沒有任何東西 任何人 能讓你做好步入婚姻的準備的
Nothing. Nobody. Nothing gets you ready for marriage.
沒人會告訴你 一旦結了婚 你就沒機會做愛了
Nobody tells you that once you get married, you will never fuck again.
你要喜歡做愛 婚姻不適合你
If you like fucking, marriage ain't for you.
艸 我TM都7年沒做過愛了
Shit, I haven't fucked in seven years.
但我有性交哦
I've had intercourse.
性交 是她洗完澡裹著浴巾出來
Intercourse is when she gets out of the shower on the nice sheets.
做愛 是在一輛租來的破車的後座上干啊
Fucking's in the back of a rental car
那些你女人叫著 "快來上我啊! " 的時候
when your woman's going, "Come on, get some! "
你都沒心理準備啊
Nobody gets you ready for that shit.
沒人告訴你你一旦結了婚 你就別想再見著妹妹了
Nobody tells you that once you get married, you will never get pussy again.
你要喜歡妹妹 婚姻不適合你
If you like pussy, marriage ain't for you.
我7年都沒見過妹妹了啊
I haven't had pussy in seven years.
但我見著*道了
I've had vagina.
我討厭那貨
I hate vagina.
我就打那裏出來的
I came out of a vagina.
我一出來就說 "喂 我得弄點妹妹"
As soon as I got out, I said, "Man, I got to get me some pussy."
所以沒人和你說啊 沒人告訴你結了婚的女人就沒妹妹了
See, they don't prepare you. They don't tell you married women don't have pussies.
結了婚的女人只有*道
Married women have vaginas.
如果你去參加婚禮 一個女人在拋那個花
If you go to a wedding and the woman's throwing the bouquet,
她拋的哪是花啊 她拋的是她妹妹啊
she ain't throwing the bouquet, she's throwing the pussy.
"這個我以後用不著了嚎"
"I won't be needin' this no more."
接住她妹妹的那個女的就能結婚了
And the woman that catches it is gonna get married
因為她現在有倆妹妹了啊
cos now she got two pussies.
那妞你一定得拿下
You gotta marry the two-pussy girl.
但婚姻裏吃虧的不只是男人 女人們 你們也吃虧
But it ain't just men that lose out on marriage. Women, you lose out too.
各位 你一旦嫁給了他 他就再也不舔你妹妹了
Women, once you get married, he will never lick your pussy again.
妹妹 *道 隨便你怎麼叫 他就是不添了
Pussy, vagina, whatever the fuck you wanna call it. He will never lick it again.
我看台下個別已婚婦女熱淚盈眶了已經
I see some married women with tears in they eyes right now.
他就是不舔了
He will never lick your pussy again.
永遠永遠 "永永遠遠? " 永永遠遠
Forever ever. "Forever ever? " Forever ever.
他就再也不舔你妹妹了
He will never lick your pussy again.
真的 但別誤解
That's right. Don't get me wrong,
他會舔個一遍
he'll give it one coat.
但不會有以前舔得那麼徹底了
But he ain't gonna put the finish on it like he used to.
以前給你舔得那個亮啊
He used to put a spit-shine on your pussy.
你自己要往下看一眼都得戴墨鏡啊
You had to put on shades just to look at your pussy.
給你那邊上貼個標籤...
Put a little sticker next to your pussy...
"您看到的B間距離可能大於實際距離"
"objects in pussy may appear closer than they actually are."
措手不及啊
Nobody gets you ready for this shit.
沒錯 各位 一旦你結婚了 沒人給你吹簫了
That's right, fellas, once you get married, no more blow jobs.
你要喜歡別人給你吹 婚姻不適合你
If you like blow jobs, marriage ain't for you.
我7年沒享受過這個了啊
I haven't had a blow job in seven years.
但我有口交哦
I've had fellatio.
你沒結婚的時候 這吹得那是世界第一啊
When you're single, you get the best blow jobs in the world,
一口氣 8分鐘 12分鐘 一刻鐘
eight, 12, 15 minutes straight
好像她在對著你老二試音啊 好像她在給你老二做二次檢查啊
like the girl's auditioning on your dick, like she's giving your dick a second opinion,
好像她在考她的潛水執照啊
like she's going for her scuba license.
你一結婚 每個結了婚的男人都只剩那敷衍了事的活了
You get married, every married man I know gets the same lazy-ass blow job.
這舔個三下 一 二 三
It's like three licks, ahh, ahh, ahh.
"硬了沒? 快進來 這點衣服我還沒疊完呢"
"Is it hard? Put it in. I gotta fold these clothes."
這吹的是哪門子簫啊我日?
What kind of lazy-ass blow job is this shit?
飯店裏要是端上來這種菜 我TM直接把它彈回廚房了啊
If we was at a restaurant I would send it back.
小二 這菜還沒做到位啊
Waiter, this blow job ain't ready yet.
婚姻是艱苦的啊 真心艱苦
Yo, marriage is tough, man. Marriage is real fucking tough.
這能有多痛苦哦 納爾遜·曼德拉離婚了
納爾遜·曼德拉 南非前總統 諾貝爾和平獎獲得者
Marriage is so tough, Nelson Mandela got a divorce.
納爾遜·曼德拉都TM離婚了啊
推翻了南非白人種族主義統治統治
