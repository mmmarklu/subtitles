看
Here it is.
這就是你們的未來
This is your future.
你們的一個魔笛手盒子
One of your Pied Piper boxes
就會被放在這里
would go right here in this rack.
好吧
Okay.
好了
Okay.
我再帶你們去看看
Let me show you the next location
即將用來安置你們的盒子的下一個地方
in which we would install one of your boxes.
理查德  我們到底特么在這里干什么
Richard. What the fuck are we doing here?
我心里也不好過
I don't like it any more than you do.
我跟杰克說了會先來看看
I told Jack we'd come check this place out
然后回去和他再做討論
and then we'd have a discussion.
你特么竟然提出建議
I can't believe you suggested the idea
要做這么個破玩意
of building a fucking appliance.
我沒有
I didn't, okay?
我提這個是為了做反例
I pitched it as an example of what not to do
結果那群傻逼銷售人員卻選了這個方案
and the fucking sales guys ran with it.
我一直不想把公司企業化的
I didn't want to go to enterprise.
是你們非說這樣挺好的
You were the ones who said it would be fine.
-我們可沒那么說  -你們明明一直在說
- No, we didn't say that. - You said it all the time.
我們可不是那么說的  我們...
That's not what we said. That is not...
到了  這就是另一個用于放置
Here it is. This is where another one
你們的魔笛手盒子的地方
of your Pied Piper boxes would go.
哦  很好
Okay. Good.
好了  我再帶你們去看下一個
Okay. Let me show you the next location
- 用于安置...  -等一下
- in which we would install-- - Actually, you know what?
不好意思  這些空位長得都一樣
Sorry. No offense, but once you see one space in a rack,
沒必要挨個看一遍
you've kind of seen them all.
我以前也是這么想的
That's what I used to think...
但看完之后就改變想法了
until I saw them all.
想不想看看你們的書桌
Would you like to see your desks?
-什么書桌  -你說啥
- Our desks? - What?
這是我們用于安置
This is where we would install
魔笛手工程師的地方
a Pied Piper engineer.
不好意思  我們為什么要待在這里
Sorry. Why, exactly, would we need to be here?
你們的銷售代表
Your sales representative
保證會有全天24小時  現場維護
promised 24-hour-a-day, on-site maintenance...
至少第一年是這樣的
at least for the first year.
所以我們中的一個人必須要在這里
So, one of us would have to be down here
待一整年
for a year?
晚上也要在這里
Even at night?
在這里其實白天黑夜并沒有分別的
There's really no difference between day and night down here,
所以也不會那么難過
so it makes things easy.
好吧  我們也該走了  立刻馬上
Okay, well, we should probably get going. Now.
-差不多就現在吧  -嗯  現在就該走了
- Almost right now. - Yeah, right now even.
好的  這里有16個樓梯井
Okay. There are 16 stairwells.
你們想先看哪個
Which one would you like to see first?
哪個最近去哪個吧
Just whatever's as fast as possible.
你最喜歡的那個吧
Your favorite one. 
好
Okay.
你看到那些獲得跟鼴鼠似的人了嗎
Oh! You see these fucking mole people?
約翰去哪兒了
Hey, where did John go?
我擦  他是不是拐進哪個房間了
Oh shit. Did he go in a room?
沒有吧  應該就在這附近吧
No. Uh... probably around here.
約翰
Hey, John?
-約翰  -約翰
- John? - Oh. Uh... John?
-約翰  -糟了
- John! - Oh shit.
約翰
John!
-他去哪兒了  約翰  -約翰
- Where is he? John! - John!
《硅谷》  第三季  第三集
我們不能就這樣把我的算法
We can't take my algorithm
鎖進一個盒子里  就此掩埋在蟻穴啊
and put it in a box and bury it at Maleant.
-不能這樣啊  -它好像死了
- We just can't. - I think this thing is dead.
杰克  聽著  我知道
Jack, look, I have no doubt
那些銷售人員很會賣盒子
that your guys can sell a box
這樣可能短期是能賺很多錢
and an appliance may be a good short-term play,
但長期來講  我們需要建立一個
but in the long term, we need to be building
-自己的全職平臺  -格洛麗亞
- our full-time platform. - Gloria!
麻煩你聯系一下賣魚的  看看這玩意
Could you call the fish guy and see what kind of warranty
有什么擔保沒  有一條魚好像死了
we have one these things? I think one of them is dead.
杰克  算我求你了
Jack, please.
你說過等我從蟻穴回來之后
You said that when we got back from Maleant
-就跟我談談的  -好啊  那就談啊
- we would discuss this. - Okay, let's discuss it.
來看看成功三角定律
Take a look at the Conjoined Triangles of Success.
這兩個三角形合起來是什么
Now, what do those two triangles make together?
-正方形  -一個盒子  合一起是個盒子
- A square? - A box. They make a box.
-這種事情是編不出來的  -可這就是你編的啊
- You can't make that shit up. - But you literally did make it up.
沒錯  但現在這是商學院的授課教材
Yes, I did. And now they teach it at business schools.
我只是想讓你知道這有多巧合
But I was only referring to the serendipity of the coincidence.
這樣吧  如果我們做出這個盒子來
Look, if we build you the box,
你能保證完成之后讓我們建立平臺嗎
will you promise to let us build the platform when it's done?
以后的事情以后再說
We'll think about then then.
我們現在要擔心的就是現在
Now we need to worry about now.
現在就去把盒子給我做出來
Build me a box... now.
談得怎么樣
How'd it go?
不怎么樣
Not well.
好吧
All right, then.
你這是什么意思  你在干什么
What do you-- What do you mean? What are you doing?
首先  我要把領英求職網上的狀態
Well, first, I'm changing my LinkedIn status...
改成"求職"
to "Looking for work."
那個盒子就是個劣質商品  我才不要參與
That box is artless commerce. I won't be a party to it.
那你是打算就這樣辭職
So, you're just gonna quit?
就這樣  你怎么能這樣
Just like that? How-- How can you do that?
就說兩個詞  我  辭職
By saying the words "I" And "Quit"
把它們放在一起  也就是  我辭職
in conjunction together-- i.e., I quit.
可你還是得辦點離職手續的
Well, there's actually some paperwork involved.
那個USB導彈發射器可以給我嗎
Hey, can I have that USB missile launcher?
一會從垃圾桶里撿就好了
I'll just fish it out of the trash later.
吉爾弗約爾  拜托
Gilfoyle, come on.
讓我先想想辦法
Give me some time to figure a way out of this,
你要是現在辭職
'cause if you quit now,
你的股份就都沒了
you're gonna lose all your shares.
萬一巴克改主意
And what if Barker changes
又準許我們建平臺了呢
his mind and lets us build the platform?
你有多大把握他改主意
And the odds of that are?
這么快  現在的獵頭真迅速
Already? Recruiters move fast these days.
我是吉爾弗約爾  你有什么好東西
This is Gilfoyle. Dazzle me.
獵頭又送東西嗎
More recruiter swag?
還有3D眼鏡
You got an Oculus?
-沒錯  -那是懸浮滑板嗎
- Yup. - That's a hoverboard?
你答應了幾場面談
How many meetings are you taking?
一場都沒答應  諷刺吧
None. That's the irony.
拒的越多  獵頭越給我送禮
The more meetings I turn down, the more these recruiters send me.
-你干什么呢  -吃爆米花
- What are you doing? - Eating popcorn.
-那是我的  -你有七大桶呢
- That's my popcorn. - You have seven tubs of it.
你都能當爆米花城的市長了
You could be the mayor of Popcornopolis.
吃芝士和原味的  不準吃焦糖的
Don't eat the caramel. You can have the cheese or the plain.
-只給我車達芝士味的嗎  -沒錯  混蛋
- You're leaving me with the cheddar? - That's right. Dick.
這能借我用用嗎  就一會兒
Hey, can I borrow this? Just for a little bit?
不行  等等
No. Whoa, whoa, hold on.
你是戴了條金鏈子嗎
You're wearing a gold chain?
哦  這個啊  好早以前的東西了
Oh, right. Yeah, I've had it for a while.
我就偶爾戴戴
Just kind of throw it on every now and then.
你就胡扯
None of that is true.
-你要是戴過  我一定有印象  -是這樣
- I definitely would've noticed. - Okay, listen.
我一直努力工作  現在終于開始賺錢了
I've been working hard. I'm making money for the first time.
我就想  給自己買點好東西唄
I was like... buy myself something nice, you know?
結果你反倒買了條鏈子嗎
But instead of that, you bought a chain?
你個半途而廢的  就是嫉妒我有工資
You're just jealous I have a salary, quitter.
而你這么正經的人就不會辭職
And you are too legit to quit,
是吧  MC哈馬斯
eh, MC Hamas?
-去你的  -回見  鏈子處女情緣
- Fuck off. - Later, Chain the Virgin.
好了  吉爾弗約爾  看來那些獵頭
Well, Gilfoyle, looks like your recruiters
得把禮物收回去了
are gonna have to take back their gift baskets,
我剛給莫妮卡打完電話
because I just got off the phone with Monica
她安排我明早去見勞里
and she's getting me in to see Laurie this morning
就能告訴她怎么回事了
so I can tell her what's going on.
你這是  越了CEO的職權
But you're-- you're going over your CEO's head?
嚴重違反職場常規
That is a serious breach of protocol.
杰克發現了  要大發雷霆的
I mean, if Jack finds out, he'll be furious.
你要是拼命欺負誰  總有一天
Hey, when you push a man so far,
他會出去買把槍  殺了銀行里所有人
he goes out, buys a gun, and shoots everyone in a bank.
-老天  -不  我不會  不會
- Whoa. - No, I wouldn't, I wouldn't.
我不會那么做
I'm not-- I'm not going to.
我就是說
Just-- The point is,
我還有什么別的路可走嗎
what other option do I have, anyway?
你問還有什么選擇  理查德
What other option do you have, Richard?
可以和你單獨聊兩句嗎
Can I speak with you alone, please? Hmm?
你是對我有意見嗎  理查德
Are you angry with me, Richard?
我哪里惹到你了嗎
Have I done something to offend you?
沒有  什么意思
No. What are you talking about?
你們幾個拿到投資
You know, when you and the boys picked up 
搬去新辦公室時
and went to the new offices,
也沒邀請我
and didn't invite me along...
我什么都沒說
I didn't say anything. 
是  可你也不在'魔笛手'工作
Yeah, because you don't work at Pied Piper.
你就得無時不刻地
And you haven't let me forget that
提醒我這一點  是嗎  理查德
for even one moment, have you, Richard?
我有點沒聽懂
I-I-I-- I'm having trouble tracking this.
你到底在生氣什么
I don't know what you're mad about.
你剛公然宣布  得瞞著巴克越俎代庖
You publicly proclaimed, "I have to go over Barker's head
因為別無他法
because what other option do I have?"
想想你還有什么選擇  理查德
What other option do you have, Richard?
因為你的另一個選擇
'Cause there is another option,
就站在你面前  看著你
and he's standing here, looking you in the face,
而你看著他  就好像他不存在一樣
and you're staring back like he don't even exist.
我就是澄清一下
Just to be... as clear as I possibly can be here,
你的意思是  你想去和巴克談嗎
are you trying to tell me that you want to talk to Barker?
不  理查德  我不想和巴克談
No, Richard, I don't want to talk to Barker.
但我希望你想讓我和他談
I want you to want me to talk to Barker. 
反正都鬧成這樣了  你要是愿意
At this point, if it'll make you feel better,
行  你去和巴克談
sure, you can go talk to Barker.
你看
See?
有那么難嗎
Was that so hard?
其實挺讓人不舒服的
Actually, yes, that was painfully difficult.
沒錯  這只絕對死了
Yeah, she's definitely dead.
我很遺憾  格洛麗亞
I'm sorry for your loss. Gloria!
格洛麗亞
Gloria! Gl-- Oh!
煩請你把這只海王星的女兒
Would you... take this daughter of Neptune
送回故土好嗎
back from whence she came?
就是馬桶  親愛的  沒事
The toilet, dear. That's okay.
有什么要幫忙的嗎  巴赫曼先生
What can I do for you, Mr. Bachman?
對  要緊的事
Ah yes, to the matter at hand.
我和理查德談了你們的盒子項目
I spoke with Richard about the box project, and...
我就隨意說說我的想法
Well, here are some of my thoughts in no particular order.
-為什么要做盒子呢  -你要說的
- Why a box? - What information
-有什么是我還不知道的嗎  -什么
- do I not already have? - I'm sorry? 
我說  有什么是我還不知道的嗎
I said, "What information do I not already have?"
我的設備已規劃好
I already have a five-year run rate 
五年營業額和全市場預測
plus a full market forecast for my appliance.
理查德的平臺也一樣
I have the same for Richard's platform.
我聽了他工程師團隊的全部意見
I've heard all of his engineering team's complaints.
所以在你浪費時間
So, before you waste time
長篇大論胡扯些什么廢話前
with some freeform jazz odyssey of masturbatory bullshit,
告訴我你有什么我還不知道的
just tell me what concrete information you have for me
實質消息
that I do not already possess!
理查德
Richard.
依我看  你有兩個選擇
The way I see it, you've got about two options.
一  給他做個箱子
One, you build yourself the box.
二  馬上給勞里·布里姆打電話
Two, you get Laurie Bream on the phone ASAP.
好  回家見
All right, I'll see you back at the house.
好
Okay.
弘樹先生
Ah. Hiroki-san.
那是啥
What is that one?
一個用頭發做的問號
It is a question mark made of human hair,
顯然是印度死人的頭發做的
harvested, apparently, from dead people in India.
是個雙關語  說明了
It's a pun. It signifies that
'拉維加'的人要提出宏大而大膽的問題
at Raviga, we ask the big, hairy questions.
對  說到問題
Right. Speaking of questions...
我們該拿杰克怎么辦
What should we do about Jack?
我認同你的評估
Well, I concur with your assessment
為數據中心做備份
that a backup appliance for data centers seems
有點大材小用了
an uninspired application of your technology.
我會聯系他
I will contact him and we'll have
然后開誠布公地討論一下
a frank discussion about this.
太棒了  很感謝你聽取我的意見
Great. I really appreciate you hearing me out on this.
不言而喻  我從沒來找過你
And it goes without saying, I was never here.
什么
What?
你現在就在這兒啊
You are here. Now.
理查德的意思是
What Richard means is he would prefer
他希望你最好不要告訴杰克
if you didn't tell Jack
他來找你談過這件事
that he came here to talk to you about this.
好  因為別的解釋也說不通
Yes, because the other interpretation makes no sense.
杰克  勞里·布里姆來電  在線路一
Jack, Laurie Bream on line one.
同志們  好戲上演了
Guys. Guys, it's happening. It's happening.
你好
Hello.
好了  放大招吧  勞里·布里姆
Okay. Drop the hammer, Laurie Bream.
你干嗎呢  他會看見你偷看的
What are you doing? He's going to see you looking.
傻逼顯示器擋住了  我看不見
I can't see 'cause of these fucking monitors.
這是誰的錯  不是我  噓
Whose fucking fault is that, okay? It's not my-- Shh!
出事了
Something's happening.
什么
What?
怎么了  怎么了
What's happening? What's happening?
巴克怒了
Oh, man. Barker's pissed.
憤怒程度從1到10  他有多怒
How pissed? Scale of one to ten.
天吶  得有7分
Oh my God. Seven. Fuck.
不不不  有9分  9.5分
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Like a nine, nine and a half.
該死  我全都錯過了
Fuck! I'm missing everything.
我要去廚房
I'm going to go to the kitchen.
他又不知道  我興許餓了呢
He doesn't know. I could be hungry.
結束了
It's over. It's over.
因為這些破爛顯示器
I missed the whole fucking thing
我他媽錯過了整場好戲
because of these fucking monitors.
理查德  杰克叫你去他辦公室
Richard? Jack would like to see you in his office.
好的
Okay.
失陪了  先生們
If you'll excuse me, gentlemen,
我要去問杰克勞里的雞巴味道如何了
I'm gonna go ask Action Jack how Laurie's dick tastes.
雞  不對
D-- No. Yeah.
老大  你找我
You wanted to see me, chief?
對  進來  理查德  請坐
Sure, come on in, Richard. Grab a seat.
好
Sure.
你猜剛才誰給我打電話了
So, guess who I just got off the phone with.
不知道  誰
I have no idea. Who?
-勞里·布里姆  -'拉維加'的那個嗎
- Laurie Bream. - Laurie... Bream. From Raviga?
對  她堅定決絕地跟我說
Exactly. She was pretty adamant
'魔笛手'的箱子計劃
that the whole box project here at Pied Piper was...
錯得可悲
woefully misguided.
哇  說得好狠  哇
Whoa. Strong words. Wow.
實際上  她認為
In fact, it was her opinion
我們應該立刻摒棄這個計劃
that we should immediately abandon the box
讓'魔笛手'轉做用戶平臺
in favor of the consumer platform version of Pied Piper
這也是你們求之不得的吧
which I believe you and your guys were bucking for.
"求之不得"倒不至于
Oh, I don't know about "bucking,"
但是的  你看
but yeah. Yeah, well, hey, look,
勞里·布里姆是投資方
Laurie Bream is the investor. 
對  她是投資方
Yeah. She is the investor.
總之  她想在48小時內
Anyway, she wanted a comprehensive,
讓我們拿出一份完整的
go-to-market strategy
如何讓平臺進入市場的策略
for the platform version within 48 hours.
那好吧  勞里要怎樣就怎樣咯
Wow. Well, what Laurie wants, Laurie gets.
那我們趕緊開始吧
So... yeah. We should probably get started on that.
不  我們不這么干  理查德
No, we shouldn't, Richard.
我們不做平臺
We're not building the platform.
我們要做箱子
We're building a box.
好  但是
Okay, but...
勞里不是說要我們做平臺嗎
didn't Laurie say that she wanted the platform?
對  她是那么說的  然后我說
Yes, she said that, and then I said
如果'魔笛手'要做平臺的話
that if Pied Piper was going to build a platform,
她就得先炒了我
she would have to fire me.
那她怎么說的呢
Uh, what did she say?
她說目前她對此并無興趣
She said she was not interested in doing that at this time.
然后她還說了什么嗎
And did she say anything after that?
我們要做那個箱子  理查德
We're building the box, Richard.
從今天開始  12個星期的時間
Twelve weeks from today,
我們要向她提交一臺樣機
we're going to present her a prototype of that box.
所以  務必完成
So, let's get it done.
好的
Okay.
好
Yup.
還有一件事  理查德
One more thing, Richard.
如果你想刺殺國王
If you're going to shoot the king,
一定要確保下了死手
you better be goddamn sure you kill him.
你明白我的意思嗎
You understand what that means?
明吧
Yeah-ar.
你剛說了"明吧"嗎
Did you just say... "Yar"?
沒有
No.
看看咱們
Look at us.
在大道上游手好閑
Two rogues on the King's Highway.
讓鼠輩們在迷宮里兜兜轉轉吧
Let the rats run in their maze.
這是我們的選擇  這就是我們的歸宿
We chose this. This is our destiny.
自由  我說的對不  吉爾弗約爾
Freedom. Isn't that right, Gilfoyle?
-你剛說話了嗎  -當然
- Did you say something? - Of course.
如果還是爆米花  告訴他們吃不了了
If it's more popcorn, tell 'em we're at capacity.
是《黑衣人》里面的家伙
It's a guy from "Men in Black."
-伯特倫·吉爾弗約爾嗎  -對
- Bertram Gilfoyle? - Yeah.
我代表'二十幾'招聘方前來
I'm here on behalf of Twen-X recruiting,
-把這個交給你  -派比·范溫克
- I'm supposed to give you this. - Pappy Van Winkle.
經典波本威士忌
這才像話  酒我收下了
Now we're talking. I'll take it.
他們跟我說你參加會議后才能把酒給你
They told me not to give it to you until after the meeting.
你的談判技巧我很欣賞
I respect your skills.
等我穿上外套
Let me get my jacket.
她應該說服巴克斷了打造盒子的念頭
She was supposed to talk Barker out of making the box.
這他媽怎么回事
What the fuck happened?
-理查德  -干啥
- Richard. - What?
那電話我聽了  她努力了  但他說不行
I was on the call, okay? She tried, he said no.
-那她就應該炒了他  -她不能炒了他
- Well, then she should fire him. - She can't fire him.
為什么不能  她就把我給炒了
Why not? She fired me.
就是說  因為她炒了你所以不能炒了他
Exactly. She can't fire him because she fired you.
炒一個年輕CEO  再任命一個經驗豐富的
Firing a young CEO and installing a much more experienced one
這叫領導力
looks like leadership.
一個月內連炒兩個CEO叫管理混亂
Firing two CEOs in a month looks like chaos.
理查德  聽著  我很遺憾
Richard, look, I'm sorry,
但我覺得盒子是板上釘釘的事了
but I think the box is here to stay.
勞里會假裝支持這個事
Okay? Laurie's gonna have to pretend to be in favor of it.
她八成會發新聞稿
She'll probably issue press releases
說一下為什么
talking about how it's the
這是對你們高新技術的最完美應用
best application of your visionary technology.
真的沒別的辦法能讓她改主意了嗎
Is there nothing that we can say to Laurie to change her mind?
如果勞里能聽我的話
If I could control Laurie,
你覺得我還可能看到
do you really think I'd be looking
辦公室外面掛著個怪物嗎
out my office door at that monstrosity?
天  莫妮卡  他也沒那么差勁
Jeez, Monica, he's not that bad.
我是說他可能是有點丑
I mean, he's a little ugly, I guess.
你說的是那個問號  抱歉
Oh, the question mark. Sorry.
吉爾弗約爾先生  我們這邊好了
Mr. Gilfoyle. We're ready for you.
大家迫不及待要再次跟你見面了
The guys cannot wait to see you again.
再見面
Again?
-吉爾弗約爾  -這他媽什么情況
- Gilfoyle. - What the fuck?
哥們  再見到你真好  干嘛不坐下呢
Good to see you again, buddy. Why don't you have a seat?
你把我們一半的算法偷走了
You stole half of our algorithm.
你以為你能約我到這兒來
You think you can bring me in here
給我錢讓我把剩下的一半賣給你嗎
and pay me to give you the rest?
不  我們想讓你來
No. We want you
是因為你是全棧工程師
because you're a full-stack engineer.
算法缺失的部分我們已經花錢買來了
We already paid someone else for the missing piece of middle-out.
-放屁  -你認識內維和埃里克嗎
- Bullshit. - Do you know Naveen and Eric,
他們前幾天還是'紐核力'的技術帶頭人
who, until very recently, headed up engineering at Nucleus?
-你好  -最近怎么樣
- Hey, man. - What's up?
-不好  -那我相信你起碼認得出
- Nope. - Well, I'm sure you at least recognize
他們帶來的代碼
the code they brought us.
預測模塊
這就是他們的方法
That's exactly how they had it.
好吧  '尾幀'抄了我們整套的預測環路
Okay. So, Endframe has our entire prediction loop,
一直抄到代碼的最后一個分號
down to the last fucking semicolon.
'紐核力'偷了我們一半的知識產權
So, Nucleus stole half our IP,
'尾幀'偷了另外一半
and Endframe stole the other half.
現在他們把它們連在了一起
And now they've knitted them together.
在我們埋頭苦建巴克的盒子的時候
So, while we are busy building Barker's box,
'尾幀'正在用平臺搶占我們的市場
Endframe is beating us to market with a platform.
所以我們成了一家平庸的設備制造公司
So, basically, we are a fucking mediocre appliance company.
起碼做這個我們還能賺點錢
At least we'll make a little money doing it.
太好了  那你就能回到洗車店
Oh, great. So, you can go back to the car wash
再買幾條大金鏈子了
and buy some more chains.
巴基斯坦的金鏈男[天龍特攻隊]
Huh, Pakistani Mr. T?
去你媽的
Fuck you.
等等  你現在沒戴嗎
Wait. Are you not wearing it?
你沒戴啊  你是因為我開你玩笑
You're not. Did you take it off
-所以取掉了嗎  -不是
- because I was fucking with you? - No.
戴著脖子癢  所以
It was itchy on my neck, so--
放屁
Bullshit.
就不該摘下來
That was a bad decision.
你退縮了  這下就心痛到永遠了
You flinched. Now the pain will never end.
抱歉說一句  吉爾弗約爾說得對
I'm sorry to say it, but Gilfoyle's right.
你這樣越弄越糟  抱歉  姜戈
You're making it worse. Sorry, Django.
姜戈
Django?
沒鏈子的姜戈
Unchained.
真好  現在連他媽賈里德都敢搞我
Great. Now even fucking Jared is busting my balls.
我是  我是在搞你
I am. I'm-- I'm busting your balls.
你們知道嗎  如果你們還要笑我
You know what? If you're gonna give me shit for it anyway, 
我還就戴上了
I'm just going to wear it.
好  賈里德  恭喜你扳回一局
Okay, Jared. Congratulations, by the way,
但我們還有別的要搞  好嗎
but we have our own balls to worry about, all right?
聽著  我們要怎么保住平臺
Look, how are we going to save the platform?
我們能怎么著呢  巴克是首席執行官
What choice do we have? Barker is the CEO.
他說什么我們都得照做
We have to do what he says.
真得照做嗎
Or do we?
我說不好  我不想就此倒下
I don't know. I don't want to lie down for this, okay?
我不甘心就這么輕易放棄
I don't want to just give up so easily.
理查德  不幸的是  現在這情況
Richard, unfortunately, in this case 
我們不得不認命接受
I think we have to roll over and take it.
是嗎
Or do we?
-埃利希  你有話說嗎  -理查德
- Erlich, you have something to say? - Richard...
當年  喬治·華盛頓創造的事業
when George Washington founded a little startup
就是今天的美利堅合眾國
we've come to know as these United States of America,
那時他不滿他自己的首席執行官
and he was tired of getting shit from his CEO,
也就是英國國王
the King of England,
難道他認命接受了嗎
did he just roll over and take it from behind?
不  他召喚了他的生死兄弟
No. He called on his ride-or-die homeboys,
湯米·杰弗遜  本尼·富蘭克林
Tommy Jefferson, Benny Franklin,
還有半個黑人亞歷克斯·漢密爾頓  就是迪尼希  
and Alex Hamilton-- who was half-black, so that's Dinesh.
我才不是半個黑人
I'm not half-black.
他說  "停下  混蛋們
He said, "Avast, ye fellow badasses,
老子要按自己的意愿建設國家"
let's build this country the way we motherfucking want to."
所以  理查德  如果我們想建這個平臺
And so, Richard, if we want to build the platform,
我們只需要...
all we need to do is...
建平臺
build the platform.
講得不錯
That was underwhelming.
你能給我們點細節嗎
Perhaps you can go into slightly more detail?
巴克想聽什么我們就說什么
We tell Barker exactly what he wants to hear.
這樣他就會覺得我們很乖
That way, he thinks we're being good little boys.
但實際上
But what we're actually doing
我們是在建平臺  想想看
is building the platform. Think about it.
他會怎么做
What's he gonna do?
-報警吧  -不
- Call the cops. - Actually, no.
也許埃利希說對了
Erlich may be onto something.
如果我們給他的只有平臺
If all we gave him was the platform,
杰克就別無選擇
Jack would have no other option
只能接受  然后說這都是他的主意
than to embrace it and say it was his idea all along,
因為到那時  他不能告訴勞里真相
because at that point, he can't tell Laurie the truth.
難道他敢說他對自己公司
What? That he had absolutely no idea
所發生的事一無所知嗎
what was going on inside of his own company?
那會讓他看起來很傻
He'd look like an idiot.
而勞里本身也想要平臺  所以...
And Laurie wants the platform, anyway, so...
她不會怪罪的
she'd be good for it.
好
Okay.
我們搞一個  臭鼬工廠
We build... a skunkworks.
公司內部的秘密小公司
A secret company inside the company.
給他來一個"十一羅漢"
We go all "Ocean's Eleven" on his ass.
等等  "十一羅漢"
Hold on. "Ocean's Eleven"?
2001年的電影  講賭場被劫
It's a 2001 casino heist film,
茱莉亞·羅伯茨和11個男人演的
starring Julia Roberts and 11 men.
我知道那是什么  賈里德
I know what it is, Jared.
我是說  我們不僅要構建
I'm saying not only are we going to have to engineer,
編程  完全自己建平臺
code, and stand up a full platform on our own,
還要讓杰克和他的人認為
we also have to make Jack and his sales weasels think
我們其實一直在造盒子
we're working on the box the entire time.
如果我們不小心搞砸被抓到
And if we fuck anything up and get caught,
他會拿走我們的股份  可能還會叫警察抓我們
he could take our stock and probably have us arrested.
-好  我加入  -你瘋了
- All right, I'm in. - Well, you're insane.
不  迪尼希  你的金鏈子才是瘋了
No, Dinesh, that chain is insane.
不是歌里的那個
And not in the membrane.
抱歉了  清真樂隊
Sorry, Cypress Halal.
Insane In the Membrane是Cypress Hill的一首歌
而Halal是清真的意思  冷得過頭的種族歧視梗
好了  賈里德
Okay, Jared, settle down.
但這事  真的很天才
But this? This is fucking genius.
好  我們該怎么開始
Okay, how do we even begin to pull it off?
好吧  我們來具體看看
Okay. Well, let's work through it.
我可以弄虛假數據報告
I can generate fake status reports,
假采購訂單  假更新
purchase orders, deliverables updates,
我還能和銷售聯系來協調
and I can liaise with sales to coordinate
我們需要假建什么樣的功能
what custom features we need to pretend to build.
很好
Okay, great, yeah,
假建盒子是比較簡單的
but faking the box is going to be the easy part.
建平臺才是真有難度
Building the platform is the real challenge.
吉爾弗約爾  服務器怎么解決
Gilfoyle, where are we on the server space?
不太好辦
That's gonna be tricky.
我們開始搬家的時候  我拆了安東
When we started moving out of the house, I dismantled Anton.
所有框架  圖形處理器還有電纜都在公司儲藏室里
All the racks, GPUs, and cables are in storage at the office.
-要把他偷出來  -那可是一大堆硬件啊
- We're gonna have to break him out. - That's a shit-ton of hardware.
我們可以一次偷一塊
Unless we do it one piece at a time,
就像"肖申克的救贖"
like "Shawshank Redemption"
或者"勝利大逃亡"  明白嗎
or "The Great Escape," You know?
我偷東西那天穿件更寬大的衣服
I'd have bigger clothing on the day, but--
-等等  -等等
- Wait. - Wait.
我有更好的主意
I've got a better idea.
假設這些積木是安東
Let's say these Legos are Anton,
服務器零部件都可憐地
sad stacks of server components
在儲藏室里睡覺
lying dormant in storage.
全部偷運出來太難了
Sneaking all of him out would be too difficult.
但如果我們偷不出來
So, if we can't break Anton out,
也許可以我們自己進去
maybe we can break in.
就在那里把服務器組裝起來
Stand the servers up right where they are.
-我們做得到嗎  -簡單
- Can we do that? - Easy.
我可以將電纜從天花板的托板后面
I can run cable through the drop panel in the ceiling
一直穿過去接到主電源板上
all the way to the building's main power panel.
然后我們從每個人那邊
When I pull a little bit of power
都偷一點電過來  沒人會知道的
from each of the other tenants, no one will know.
伙計們  我不想潑冷水
Guys, I hate to keep shitting on your campfire,
但服務器不是主要問題
but servers are not the real issue.
我們人力不足
We have a manpower problem.
建平臺可是個大工程
There's a ton of engineering to be done on the platform.
沒錯  他說得對  但我們必須偷偷付他們錢
Yeah, he's right, but we have to pay them under the table.
我正好認識合適的人
I know just the right man for the job.
你們真是瘋了  但我喜歡
You guys are fucking nuts, but I dig it.
這樣吧  我之前在這干活沒要錢
Here's the deal. I'm going to need the back pay you guys owe me
你們得給我補上錢
for when I was working for free,
以及我辭職損失的工資
not to mention lost wages from my old job.
以及賈里德性騷擾我  要我做那個
Oh, and damages from when Jared sexually harassed me
莫妮卡妞的閨蜜所造成的精神損失
into being friends with that Monica chick.
所以  你加入我們嗎
So... all that and you're in?
加入  個鬼
In? No.
這只是不向巴克告發你們的
That's just to keep me from telling Barker
秘密行動的封口費
about your secret project.
什么  你說真的
What? Are you serious?
真真兒的
Oh yeah.
卡爾拉
我們手里的大部分現金都沒了
Well, there goes most of our cash.
我們剛剛被勒索了兩萬塊
We just got extorted for $20,000.
去他的卡爾拉  她本來也只是累贅
Fuck Carla. She was dead weight, anyway.
-有別的辦法嗎  -我有個點子
- What's next? - I just thought of something.
這是個大事  但我想我有辦法
It's a big problem, but I think I've got a solution.
你好  我是伯特倫·吉爾弗約爾
Hello, this is Bertram Gilfoyle.
沒錯  我仍在求職
Yes, I'm still available,
而我愿意與你和你的客戶再談一談
and I would reconsider sitting down with you and your clients
只要你在半小時或更短時間內
if you send four large pizzas
叫四個大號披薩
to 5230 Newell Road
送到紐維爾路5230號
in 30 minutes or less.
好了  我看差不多了
Okay. I think that covers it.
方方面面都想到了  計劃想好了
We've thought of everything. We have a plan.
-大家同意嗎  -同意
- Everybody in? - In.
-同意  -太他媽同意了
- In. - Fuck yes, I'm in.
我還覺得我需要
And I'm in to the idea of taking
承擔更多的領導職責
a bigger leadership role in the company.
我們不會再犯同樣的錯誤...
We're not gonna make the same mistakes--
埃利希  說"同意"就好
Okay, Erlich, just-- just say, "in."
-我們都只說"同意"  -我同意加入
- We're all just saying, "in." - I'm in...volved.
每次加盟都少不了同意
Hey, you can't spell "involved" without an "in."
同意就得了  迪尼希呢
Just be in. Uh, Dinesh?
好吧  去他的  我同意  不過有個條件
All right, fuck it, I'm in... but on one condition.
我要大家都莊嚴宣誓
I'm going to need everyone to solemnly swear,
再也不拿我的大金鏈子開玩笑了
that they will no longer make fun of my gold chain.
一個字都不許提
Not a word ever again.
幾位  我覺得這個條件還是可以同意的
Well, guys, I think we can agree to that.
這么大的犧牲  這個計劃最好管用
This plan better fucking work with a sacrifice like this.
我們要不喝杯波本來慶祝一下吧
Shall we drink from the teat of Pappy to celebrate?
我看我沒準會喜歡上班了呢
I think I might actually enjoy going to work now.
等等
Wait.
我們不能喜歡上班
We can't enjoy going to work.
梅納茨哈根的背包
Meinertzhagen's haversack.
-什么  -梅納茨哈根的背包
- What? - Meinertzhagen's haversack.
沒人知道嗎  不會吧
No one? Really?
沒人聽說過梅納茨哈根的背包嗎
No one's heard of Meinertzhagen's haversack?
當然聽說過  賈里德  快解釋給他們
Of course I have, Jared. Just explain it to them.
這是一個軍事欺騙的原則
Well, it's a principle of military deception.
簡單來說就是戲要做足
Essentially, it means you have to continue to act the part.
在大家眼里
So, as far as anyone knows,
我們還是在造我們討厭的盒子
we're still building a box that we hate.
我們要有這個樣子
We need to act like it.
說的沒錯
That's exactly right.
如果我們做得不像  巴克就會懷疑我們
If we do anything differently, Barker's going to be onto us.
我們必須要向巴克不停地抱怨
We have to keep complaining about Barker.
我們必須對這個盒子絮叨個沒完
We have to keep bitching about the box.
我們必須要繼續取笑你的大金鏈子
We have to keep making fun of your gold chain.
必須如此  沒有別的辦法  迪尼希
We have to. We don't have any other choice, Dinesh.
-他說得對  -真抱歉  大歌星迪尼希- He's right. - It's a shame, Bell Biv Dinesh,
另一個愛戴大金鏈子的組合
不過說句難聽的  那金鏈子簡直辣眼
but unfortunately, that chain is... Poison.
好了  敬臭鼬工廠
All right. To skunkworks!
那好吧  我一般不會大早上
Hey, all right. I don't usually drink
七點半就喝酒  不過
7:30 in the morning, but...
那就喝吧
All right.
哥幾個  我們必須把這里涉及臭鼬工廠的
Hey, guys, look, we have to shred everything in this house
一切資料都粉碎掉
that pertains to skunkworks. 
只要有任何人發現哪怕一丁點我們的計劃
If anyone catches wind of anything that we've done here,
我們就死定了
we are fucked.
停車場一層
好了幾位  要上戰場了
Okay, you guys, this is it.
回不了頭了
No turning back now.
迪尼希  我想了幾個關于你大金鏈子的笑話
Dinesh, I have a few premium chain insults
等到了上面我就說給你聽
that I'm going to lay on you when we get in there.
不是為了我自己  而是為了掩護大家
Not for myself, obviously, but for the team.
我也想了一兩個  提前道個歉
I just might have one too. Sorry in advance.
好  太好了
Yeah. Great.
盡管說吧  混蛋們
Have at it, assholes.
迪尼希  好一條粗鏈子  你和你媽肛交的時候
Hey, Dinesh, nice chain. Do you choke your mother with it
就是拿這鏈子勒她脖子的嗎
when you put your penis in her butthole?
你腦抽了嗎  我去
What the fuck? Oh shit!
-理查德  -好了  我幫你撿
- Richard. - Here, I've got it.
不行不行  那是我的私人資料  還給我
No, no, no, that's private. Excuse me.
臭鼬工廠
Skunkworks?
那是私人信息
Private information.
基斯  你要去哪
Uh, Keith, where are you going?
理查德  你為什么要
Richard, why did you bring
把臭鼬工廠文件帶到辦公室來
all the skunkwork docs into the office?
你應該把這些文件碎掉
You were supposed to shred those.
沒錯  但我想帶到這里來粉碎的
Yes, but I was gonna shred them here,
我們家里又沒有粉碎機  是不是
because we don't have a shredder at the house, do we?
幾位
Guys?
來我辦公室  馬上
My office. Now.
