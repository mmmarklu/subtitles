What the hell are you talking about?
Jesus. do you remember five years ago
when your kidneys failed?
Now. if you were a loser...
...would they haνe found a donor
with a tissue match so quickly?

of that, one in a million? Jesus.
Great. So l'm lucky because
my brother died in an explosion?
l didn't say that. I said you're lucky
those kids found his kidneys.
Look. your brother Jimmy

Oh, God. Not Mary again.
天，別再是瑪麗了

我知那段愛，來去匆匆…
但我知自己浴在愛河
迷戀不會有十三年那麼長吧

瑪麗怎樣了？
Whatever happened to Mary?
Τold you. she moνed with her family

與家人搬去邁亞密
為何不去找她

Τo find her, follow her around.
She won't know anything.

也許她已兒女成群
像瑪麗這種女孩，不會獨身的

常去邁亞密，可找他幫手
