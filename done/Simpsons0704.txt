贊美詩在這里 我這有贊美詩
趁它們還神圣的時候赶緊拿啊
Hymns here! I got hymns here!
Get 'em while they're holy!
淨化 從上帝心中到你的口中
Fresh from God's brain to your mouth!
現在請起立 打開贊美詩
And now please rise
for our opening hymn...
啊 在伊甸園內
uh, "In the Garden of Eden"...
作者是 I. Ron Butterfly
(Bart發的并不是贊美詩...是搖滾樂)
by I. Ron Butterfly.
* 在伊甸園內 親愛的 *
In the garden of Eden, honey
* 你不知道我愛你么 *
Don't you know that I love you
* 在伊甸園里 寶貝 *
In the garden of Eden, baby
* 你不知道我總是對的 *
Don't you know
that I'll always be true
那個...Marge 
你記得我們什么時候學過這篇
Hey, Marge, remember
when we used to make out to this hymn?
噓 噓 噓
Shh! Shh! Shh!
* 噢 你不跟我來么 *
Oh, won't ya come with me
* 拉著我的手 *
And take my hand
等等...
Wait a minute.
听起來好像搖滾
This sounds like rock and/or roll.
* 在陸上行走 *
And walk this land
我知道是你們其中一個干的
I know one of you
is responsible for this.
所以跟著我說
"如果我隱瞞真相 我就會下地獄
So repeat after me: If I withhold
the truth, may I go straight to hell...
在那里我只能吃燒紅的煤塊
where I will eat naught
but burning-hot coals...
只能喝熱可樂
and drink naught
but burning-hot cola.
在那里暴躁的魔鬼會從背后偷襲
Where fiery demons
will punch me in the back...
在那里我的靈魂會被割成碎屑
where my soul
will be chopped into confetti...
撒在整隊的凶手和單身母親身上
(注: 圣經認為單身母親是罪孽)
and strewn upon a parade of murderers
and single mothers...
在那里我的舌頭會被貪婪的鳥叼出來"
where my tongue will be
torn out by ravenous birds.
是Bart干的!
Bart did it!
- 就是Bart ! 就是他!
- Milhouse
- That Bart right there!
- Milhouse!
Milhouse 你做得很對
Milhouse, you did the right thing.
Bart 過來接受懲罰
Bart, come with me
for punishment.
你也是 告密者
You too, snitchy.
我要你們倆清理每一根風琴管子
I want you to clean
every one of these organ pipes...
被你們流行樂污染的管子!
that you have befouled
with your popular music.
你這混蛋!
怎么能告密呢!
You shank!
How could you tell on me?
那個 我是怕餓鳥把我的魂給叼沒了
Well, I didn't want hungry birds
pecking my soul forever.
靈魂 拜托 Milhouse
世上沒有靈魂這樣東西
Soul? Come on, Milhouse.
There's no such thing as a soul.
那個是編出來嚇唬小孩的
It's just something
they made up to scare kids...
就像惡巫師
或者Michael Jackson
like the boogeyman,
or MichaelJackson.
但是每种宗教都宣稱是有靈魂的 Bart
But every religion says
there's a soul, Bart.
他們干嘛要撒謊
有什么好處么
Why would they lie?
What would they have to gain?
我听不到刷管子的聲音啦
I don't hear scrubbing!
就算靈魂是存在的 它又在哪
If your soul's real, where is it?
大概在這里
It's kinda in here...
你一打噴嚏
靈魂就會伺机而逃
and when you sneeze,
that's your soul trying to escape.
說聲"上帝保佑"
它就會回來
Saying "God bless you"
crams it back in...
當你死了
靈魂會爬出來然后飛走
and when you die
it squirms out and flies away.
啊 那要是你死在海底的潛水艇里呢
Uh-huh. What if you die in a submarine
at the bottom of the ocean?
哦 靈魂會游泳
Oh, it can swim.
它甚至還有輪子 要是你死在沙漠
它就自己開回公墓
It's even got wheels, in case you die in the desert
and it has to drive to the cemetery.
眼鏡跟瓶子底似的 
怎么就那么傻呢
How can someone with glasses that thick
be so stupid?
听著 你沒靈魂
我沒靈魂
Listen, you don't have a soul,
I don't have a soul.
- 根本沒有靈魂這樣東西
- 好吧
- There's no such thing as a soul!
- Fine.
如果你那么肯定
你干嘛不把靈魂賣給我
If you're so sure about that,
why don't you sell your soul to me?
你出多少
How much you got?
- 5美金
- 成交
- Five bucks.
- Deal.
給你
一個靈魂
There you go.
One soul.
交易愉快
Pleasure doing business with you.
不客气 哥們
Anytime, chum...
p.
好啦 今晚想去哪里吃飯 孩子們
All right, where would you kids
like to eat tonight?
"意面專家"
The Spaghetti Laboratory!
吃餡餅!
Face-Stuffers!
V.J. Cornucopia教授的夢幻食物樂園
和超級美式牛排
Professor V.J. Cornucopia's Fantastic
Foodmagorium and Great American Steakery.
這間怎么樣
Well, what about this place?
Moe酒館
Moe's.
啊 陽光
Aah! Natural light!
滾開 滾開
Get it off me!
Get it off me!
抱歉
我以為這是間家庭餐館
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought this was a family restaurant.
是的 是的
Oh, it is. It is.
只要 嗯 把凳子推到台球桌那里
Just, uh, pull them stools
up to the pool table.
爸爸 這個地方
Daddy, this place...
聞起來好奇怪
smells like tinkle!
嗯嗯 我想我們還是去
德州奶酪蛋糕坊吧
 
Mm-hmm. I think we'll just go
to the Texas Cheesecake Depository.
最近只要是人都去了家庭餐館
Everybody is going
to family restaurants these days.
好像沒人再想挂在濕冷的地窖里了
Seems nobody wants to hang out
in a dank pit no more.
 Moe 你不會是想擺脫這里吧
You ain't thinkin' of gettin' rid
of the dank, are ya, Moe?
啊 也許我會考慮的
Ahh, maybe I am.
可是 Moe 寒冷 是寒冷啊
Ah, but, Moe, the dank-
the dank!
是啊 家庭餐館
有錢人的地方
Yeah, family restaurants.
That's where the big bucks are.
我要改變這里的風格
I could turn this joint into a place...
成為你愿意帶家人來的地方
where you wouldn't be ashamed
to bring your family!
我沒不愿意啊
I'm not ashamed.
嗨 把那玩意放下面
Hey, put a coaster under that.
噢 Lisa
Oh, Lisa!
車道上有份小禮物是你的
There's a little present for you
lying in the driveway!
真的嗎
Oh, boy! Really?
啊 不要 這玩意流得我滿身是口水
Aaah! No! It's dripping
funny-smelling water all over me!
我浪費了5美金啊 5美金!
I wasted five bucks on these.
你從哪掙得5美金?
我也要
Where'd you get five bucks?
I want five bucks.
- 我吧靈魂賣給了 Milhouse
- 什么
- I sold my soul to Milhouse.
- What?
你怎么能這么做
你的靈魂是身体中最重要的部分
How could you do that?
Your soul is the most valuable part of you.
那鬼話你也信
You believe in that junk?
不管靈魂是不是真正存在 Bart
Well, whether or not
the soul is physically real, Bart...
它是我們內心中美好的象征
it's the symbol
of everything fine inside us.
嘖嘖
可怜的單蠢 Lisa
Tsk-tsk-tsk.
Poor, gullible Lisa.
我繼續我的混賬理論 謝啦
I'll keep my crappy sponges, thanks.
Bart 靈魂是你身上唯一能永存的部分
Bart, your soul is the only part of you
that lasts forever.
只花5美金
Milhouse就能永遠擁有你
For five dollars,
Milhouse could own you for a zillion years.
好吧 如果你覺得他買得很值
我把良心賣你 4.5美金
Well, if you think he got such a good deal,
I'll sell you my conscience for 4.50.
我的自尊也賣的
I'll throw in
my sense of decency too.
現在是Bart特賣場!
是我的就賣啊!
It's a Bart sales event!
Everything about me must go!
嗨 哥們 最近好么
Hey, boy. How ya doin'?
上帝
誰惹你了
Man!
What's gotten into you?
老天! 您整天吃虫子
有啥可傲慢的
Geez! You're pretty uppity
for someone who eats bugs all day.
傻x自動門
Stupid automatic door.
謝啦 門!
Thank you, door!
賣冰淇淋的看見這個
肯定會發瘋的
Some ice cream guy's gonna see that,
and it'll blow his mind.!
讓我試試
Let me try.
呼吸不得法?
還是已經沒气了?
Way to breathe, No-Breath.
今天好奇怪啊
This is getting weird.
Sanjay跟Windex一起到入口處

Itchy&Scratchy
The Itchy & Scratchy Show
Ah!
我知道這個很搞笑
但是我不想笑
I know that's funny,
but I'm just not laughing.
嗯 Pablo Neruda說過
笑是語言的靈魂 
Hmm. Pablo Neruda said laughter
is the language of the soul.
我對Pablo Neruda的著作很熟
I am familiar with the works
of Pablo Neruda.
我想我們應該做個測試
I think we should do a test.
D'oh!

Why isn't anybody- Ow!

Hi. Is Milhouse home?
他在跟他的﹛戰士﹛玩土呢
He's playing in the dirt
with his army men.
噢 我想還有一張白紙
Oh, and a white piece of paper, I believe.
掩護我 士兵
我去把Bart的靈魂拿下
Cover me, Sarge.
I'm going after Bart's soul.
如果連阿亞圖拉都不能胜利的話
那沒人行了!
If the ayatollah can't have it,
no one can!
- 啊 那個 Milhouse...
- 干嘛?
- Uh, you know, Milhouse-
- Ye-e-e-es?
- 我打賭你對靈魂已經厭倦了吧?
- 沒!
- Bet you're gettin' tired of that soul, huh?
- No!
那么 假如有人想買的話
Well, suppose someone
wanted to buy it from you.
哦
你想買回去么 Bart?
Oh.
You wanna buy it back, Bart?
好吧
沒問題
Sure. No problem.

你至少還有我們
Well, look at the bright side, Moe-
you still got us.
對啊對啊
我覺得好過一點了
Yeah. Yeah. You know, that actually
makes me feel a little better.
為什么? 這問題一開始就存在
Why? That was the problem
in the first place.
你會破產因為
我們是你唯一的客人
You were going broke
because we were your only customers.
難道不是一開始的問題么
你會破產?
Wasn't that the problem in the first place,
that you were going broke?
Moe? Moe?

Hey! Moe?
你在想你燒掉的錢對不對?
You're thinking about

What was it,
50- $60,000? Moe?
听著 如果能讓你修正開始的錯誤的話
這筆錢是值得的 Moe?
Look, maybe it would help if you went over all
the mistakes you made from the beginning. Moe?
