and take us to the cash drawer, ma'am?
想都別想 - 別敬酒不吃
- I will not.
- We ain't asking.
抽屜現在還沒有現金
There's no money
in the drawers yet.
錢都在保險箱裏 我又不知道密碼
It's in the safe

你們是新人? 我猜的
Y'all are new at this,
I'm guessing.
錢在哪? - 說了在保險櫃
- Where's the money?
- I told you, it's in the safe.
那誰才知道密碼? - 克勞森先生
- Well, who has the code?
- Mr. Clauson.
他馬上到 我建議你們趕緊收手
He'll be here soon
and I suggest you fellers don't be.
你們這種小兒科罪行真是太傻了
All you're guilty of right now
is being stupid.
趕緊走 這事也就算了
Just leave and that's all it'll be.
你再說一遍我傻試試看
Tell me I'm stupid again.
克勞森什麼時候過來? - 你看著我

This ain't about you, darling.
埃爾希 你還好嗎?
Elsie, you all right?
早上好
Good morning.
你不用非得揍他的
You didn't have to hit him.
慢點開 - 就這速度了

看見沒 老弟 不用杞人憂天
See, little brother,
not a worry in the world.
計劃沒有變化快
Planning this and doing it
is two different things.
興許我們應該先去奧爾尼
Maybe we should get there ahead,
get up to Olney.
早起的鳥兒才有蟲吃嘛
Early bird gets the worm.
慢點 - 就這速度了
- Slow down.
- I ain't speeding.
我在穀倉找到這些硬幣
I found these coins
in the barn.
鬼知道它們在那裏多久了
Lord knows how long
they've been sitting there.
我每天節衣縮食 才攢了這些硬幣
I've been living off an inmate's diet,
and had all these coins
一直在飼料袋子底下埋著
sitting right underneath
a bunch of feed sacks.
這上面印著1953 - 1953?
- This one says 1953.
-1953?
說不定有收藏價值
I wonder if any of these
is collector's items.
那你可就坐擁一座金山了
You could be sitting
on a fortune here.
希望吧
I hope so.
夥計們早上好 打開抽屜
Good morning, folks.
Open the drawer!
快他媽把抽屜打開
Open the motherfucking drawer!
只要1、5、10、20塊 不要一百的 不要成捆的
Ones, fives, 10s, 20s,
no hundreds, no bundles.

- Shut up.
手放櫃檯上 快放在櫃檯上
Put your hands on the counter.
On the counter.
是 先生 - 這就對了 快點

Uh-uh, uh-uh.
No bundles.
就要散錢
Just loose cash.
好的
Okay-
你們可不害臊
You ought to be
ashamed of yourselves.
手放櫃檯上 放我能看見的地方
Hands on the counter
where I can see them!
是 先生
Yes, sir.
老爺子身上有槍沒?
You got a gun on you, old man?
老子身上就是有槍 咋地
You're damn right
I got a gun on me.
快拿下他的槍啊 - 知道了
- Are you gonna get his gun?
- Yeah.
控住場子行不行?
Keep up with
the circumstances, okay?
拿到了 - 你們打算搶我的槍?
- Yeah, I got it.
- So are y'all gonna steal my gun, too?
我自然帶槍了
I have my own gun.
我們不是搶你的 我們只搶銀行
We ain't stealing from you.
We're stealing from the bank.
感激不盡
Much obliged.
撤走!
Let's go!
不好意思啦
Sorry about this, folks.
倆臭不要臉的王八犢子
Dirty, rotten sons of bitches.
操你媽的老頭子!
Fuck you, old man!
快走 跑啊!
Go, run, go!
你讓他把槍放在櫃檯上?想害死我們?
Put the gun on the counter?
You trying to get us killed?
我不會搶老人家的東西
I ain't stealing
from some old man.
一次只玩一票 僅此
We're stealing
from one place, that's it.
你就要變成個可憐巴巴的小罪犯了
You're turning out to be
a poor-ass criminal.
滾犢子
Oh, fuck you.
Whoo!
早起的小鳥真的有蟲吃吧?
See what the early bird gets?
沒準我們可以去傑頓分行幹一票?
Maybe we should hit
that branch in Jayton?
不能 我們只搶計劃內的銀行
No, we ain't.
We hit those banks
早上第一票真他媽蠢 空的
first thing in the fucking morning,
when they're empty.
在沒人的時候去 - 真他媽的
- When they're empty, God damn it!
- All right.
這是我最後一次被人射
It's the last time
I care to be shot at.
我們得放聰明點 老干半吊子的事情
We got to be smart.
We're a ways from being finished.
我他媽可以這麼過一周
Shit, I can do this all week.
等著瞧
We're gonna.
老弟啊 我們好比科曼奇人
We're like the Comanches,
little brother,
隨心所欲搞突襲
raiding wherever we please
整個德州都抓不住我們一根毛
with the whole of Texas
hunting our shadow.
平原之王
Lord of the Plains.
手拿下去 - 滾你媽蛋
- Hands off.
- Fuck off!
聽說那些搶銀行的了嗎?
You hear about these bank robberies?
你為什麼總跟我撞衫?
Why are you always
dressed like me?
這是我們的制服
This is our uniform.
我們沒什麼制服
We ain't got no uniform.
你可以選自己喜歡顏色的襯衫穿
You can wear whatever
color shirt you choose.
你一直學我而已
You just keep choosing mine.
巡警手冊寫著可以穿白色、藍色或者棕色的襯衫
Ranger regs say white,
blue, or tan dress shirts.
基於規則 我們可以穿同樣的襯衫
Stands to reason every once in a while
we're gonna be dressed the same.
你很明白什麼叫做跟屁蟲 阿爾貝托
Well, you know what they say
about imitation, Alberto.
你到底想摸摸這些銀行搶匪的老底
You wanna hear
about these bank robberies,
還是就在這坐著 讓那些蠢蛋逍遙法外?
or you'll just sit there
and let Alzheimer's run its course?
他們都去過哪?
Where are they at?
德州米德蘭銀行...
Texas Midlands--
阿徹城分行 和奧爾尼分行
the branch in Archer City
and the branch in Olney.
FBI有沒有通緝令?
FBI want an assist?
米德蘭銀行在德州以外 沒有分支機構
Midlands ain't got
any branches outside Texas.
何況他們也只是搶個幾千塊
Plus, they're just hitting the drawers
for a few thousand.
FBI才懶得管呢
FBI don't want it.
你沒準還能找點樂子...
You may get to have some fun
趁你還沒退休
before they send you off
to the rocking chair yet.
給我清醒點
I need you sober.
誰他媽喝瓶啤酒就醉了?
Who the hell gets drunk
off a beer?
這破地方真爛透了
Place looks like shit.
你還有什麼想說的嗎?
You got anything else
you wanna say?
這地方連塊像樣的牛排都沒有
There's not a decent steak
這群沒用的東西
in the whole lot
of them sorry sons of bitches.
是啊 當你光顧著蹲號子的時候
Yeah, well,
while you were busy in jail,
我忙著照顧咱老媽
I was busy looking after Mama,
所以你儘管去死吧
so you can go fuck yourself.
她在那睡床撐了多久?
Was she in that bed awhile?
三個月
Three months.
最後階段 人走得也很辛苦
The end there was pretty rough.
要是她跟我開口 我也能幫幫她的
I could've helped out a little
if she asked.
我至少也能喂餵那些瘦巴巴的牛
I could've fed
them skinny cows.
我們沒東西餵給它們
We had nothing to feed them.
那我也能打掃一下房間啊
Well, I could've helped clean up
the house a bit.
從沒把你當成是房間打掃的終結者
Never took you for the go-to guy
for house cleaning.
不 我們只是搶銀行的而已
No. Just robbing banks.
是啊
You know.
去她的
Fuck her.
她才不想跟我有什麼瓜葛
She never wanted nothing
to do with me anyway.
她留遺囑了嗎?
She leave a will?
留了
Yeah.
包括我嗎?
Am I in it?
遺囑沒什麼好看
The will don't matter.
她把所有的東西都留給了我 星期五生效歸我兒子
She left everything to me.
By Friday it all goes to my boys.
她這麼做沒別的意思
She didn't mean nothing by it.
她絕對故意的
She damn sure meant it.
她一直很恨我與老爹對著干
She always hated me
for standing up to him.
我們都得到了懲罰
We all got punished.
你不會懂 對著干造成的傷痛更持久
You never understood that fighting back
makes the beating last longer.
不 我懂
No, I understood.
所以我沒再打架 直接斃了那個狗娘養的
That's why I stopped fighting
and shot that son of a bitch.
嘿 怎麼回事?
Hey, What's going on?
有人今早搶了銀行
Somebody robbed
the bank this morning.
幹了什麼?
Do what?
如果你看見可疑人物...
If you see anyone
looking a little sideways,
來個電話
give me a call.
可疑人物可不想碰見我
Sideways don't wanna meet me.
碰見我 就是他們找繩子上吊的時候
Find itself on the wrong end
of a short rope.
那真是辛苦你 減輕了其他人不少工作
Oh, well, that would simplify things
for everyone but you.
也許吧 要上吊先得找樹是不是
Maybe,
if you can find the tree.
天吶 我愛西德州
God, I love West Texas.
巡警好 - 你們好 (德州警察被稱為巡警)
- Ranger.
- Hi there.
搶劫數額不多
Wasn't much of a robbery.
只搶了不到7000美元
Got off with just under $7,000.
搶了櫃檯里的錢 只搶面值低於20元的錢 還是散錢
Took the drawer money,
20s and under, only loose bills.
沒防盜染料嗎? - 沒有
- No ink pack?
- Nope.
聰明 - 聰明的作案手法
- Smart.
- That was smart.
我們能看一下監控錄像嗎?
Can we get a look
at the video?
我給你介紹銀行經理吧 克勞森先生
Let me introduce you
to the bank manager, Mr. Clauson.
這位是巡警漢密爾頓
This here is Ranger Hamilton.
巡警好 - 你好
- Ranger.
- Sir.
我們可以看下監控錄像嗎?
Can we get a look
at the surveillance video?
我們以前有攝像頭的 最近搞監控數字化...
We got cameras, but they're
switching us over to a digital system
以便連接到電腦系統
that feeds into the computer.
新裝的攝像頭並沒有連接到我們自己的錄像設備
These new cameras
don't hook to our VCRs.
把你們鎮裏的小警長叫來
Call over
the Young County Sheriffs.
問問他們有沒有把攝像頭接到...
Ask them if they thought
to hook their cameras
任何記錄設備上
to some sort of
recording device.
有武器嗎? - 有 手槍
- Armed?
- Yes, sir. Pistols.
哦
Oh.
臉遮住了嗎?
Faces covered?
滑雪面具 運動衫 寬鬆的褲子...
Ski masks, sweatshirts,
baggy pants...
好的 - 就像達拉斯的暴徒
- Uh-huh.
- Like them thugs in Dallas.
吸毒的 也許?
Tweakers, maybe?
可能吧
Maybe.
今天早上有吸毒犯作案
A little early in the morning
for tweakers.
吸毒犯不睡覺的 只會犯毒癮
Tweakers don't sleep.
They just tweak.
他們只搶藥店、泊車 不搶銀行
They rob drug stores
and parked cars, not banks.
我能進去看看嗎?
Can I take a look inside?
好的 長官
Yes, sir.
是 我到了 瑪格利特
Yeah, I'm here, Margaret.
他們打了你的鼻子 對嗎?
So they bopped you
in the snozzola, huh?
是的
Yes, sir.
還算好的了
Not very nice.
我知道他們的臉遮住了 但你能分辨出種族嗎?
I know their faces was covered,
but could you tell their race?
黑人還是白人?
Black, white?
你說的是他們的膚色還是他們的心?
Their skin or their souls?
我們先不談他們是否黑心
Let's leave their souls
out of this for now.
白人
White.
我猜他們就住在附近
From around here somewhere
is my guess,
從分辨他們的口音來看
you know, from their voices.
是嗎?
Oh?
揚郡發生同樣案子 在奧爾尼分行
Young County says same deal
with the branch in Olney.
稍等一下
Excuse me.
他們有錄像嗎?
Do they have video?
沒有錄像 與本行類似
Same deal all the way around.
沃爾瑪不是有賣各種電子產品的嗎?
Doesn't Walmart sell all sorts
of electronic equipment?
別老是記錄我說的話
My word.
Get your hands off that.
那些傢伙暫時不會收手 相信我
Well, these boys, they aren't done yet,
I'll tell you that.
怎麼解釋? - 他們很有耐心
- How come?
- Well, they're patient.
堅持只拿抽屜裏的錢 從不拿整百的錢
They're just sticking to the drawers,
not taking the hundreds.
百元鈔票是銀行的錢 能被跟蹤
That's the bank's money.
We can trace that.
他們想湊一大筆錢
They're trying to raise
a certain amount.
這是我的猜想
That's my guess.
他們應該還要搶一些錢才能湊夠那筆錢
It's gonna take
a few banks to get there.
你兒子們知道他們就要發財了嗎?
Your boys know how rich
they're gonna be?
他們還什麼都不知道呢
They don't know anything yet.
你帶他們去參加葬禮了嗎?
You take them to the funeral?
我說了 他們什麼都不知道
Like I said,
they don't know anything.
你上回見他們是什麼時候?
When's the last time
you saw them?
我們一起斯坦福去看了競技表演 你正好出獄
When we all went to the rodeo
in Stamford right after you got out.
那就是一年前了 - 我現在跟他們用電話聯繫
- That was a year ago.
- I talk to them on the phone.
你跟他們電話聯繫嗎?
You talk to them on the phone?
想聽聽我的建議嗎? - 不想聽
- You want a little advice?
- No. No, I don't.
明天去看看他們
Go see them tomorrow.
你知道我欠了黛比多少子女撫養費嗎?
You got any idea how much
I owe Debbie in child support?
你現在兜裏有足夠的錢
You've got enough in your front pocket
to fix that problem right now.
這錢不能動 你很清楚
We can't spare it,
you know that.
也許我們應該再幹一票分行
Maybe we should hit
another branch.
知道嗎 你說的好像我們擺脫不了這行當似的
You know, you talk like
we ain't gonna get away with this.
我就沒見到過有人可以幹了這行全身而退的
I've never met nobody who got away
with anything, ever.
憑你嗎?
You?
那你他媽為什麼還同意幹這行?
Then why in the hell
did you agree to do it?
因為是你要求的 兄弟
Because you asked,
little brother.
我去拉個屎 老了不中用
I got to shit like an old goat.
你去買單 在前門等我
Grab the check,
meet me out front.
我說的話 算是個暗示吧
Well, if that isn't a hint,
I don't know what is.
喜歡這個牛排嗎? - 是的 女士
- You like your steak?
- Yes, ma'am.
你還有很長一段路程要走啊
Well, you've got
a ways to go yet.
是啊 非要等我吃完 你得等一天
Yeah, you'll be waiting around all day
for me to finish this.
無論你吃不吃完 我都在這裏上班 所以...
I'll be here whether
you finish it or not, so...
你慢用
you take your time.
別出聲
Sure is quiet in here.
打開錢櫃 5、10、20塊的都給我拿出來
Open the drawer.
Fives, 10s, 20s.
把錢整理好擺到桌子上
Fan them out
like a deck of cards.
你是做什麼的?
What do you do?
上一份工作是在...
Last job was for a...
天然氣公司
natural gas company.
聽起來薪水不錯
Sounds high-dollar.
不 鑽井可沒那麼高的工資
No, there ain't nothing
high-dollar about drilling.
現在好像沒人鑽天然氣井了
No one seems to be
drilling for gas now, anyway.
都是鑽石油井
They're sure drilling for oil.
我是說 誰知道下一鑽會有什麼產出?
I mean, ain't one drill
the same as the next?
我也這麼想
That's my take on it.
我覺得我得讓別人相信我的話...
Guess I got to get
someone else to believe me.
婊子養的
Son of a bitch!
我們還需要一個廚師
We could use a cook.
小建議而已
Just a thought.
上菜了 詹妮·安
Order's up, Jenny Ann.
再見
Bye.
快發車!
Start the car!
操
Shit!
操 該死
Fuck! Shit!
快走 快 快!
Go, go, go!
我敢打賭你的子女扶養費絕對不要這多
I bet you don't owe this much
in child support.
我一定瘋了才會找你幫忙
I must be out of my goddamn mind
to ask you for help.
你想要害死我們嗎?!
You wanna get us killed?!
Huh?!
這不是米德蘭的分行 不在計劃內
That's not a Midlands Branch.
That's not part of the plan.
現在我們得回去牧場埋車 - 操
Now, we got to go back to the ranch
and bury the car.
操! - 不 不需要那麼做
- Fuck!
- No, we do not.
我們距離俄克拉荷馬州只有不到一半路程了
We're over halfway to Oklahoma.
我不要開一輛偷來的車去印第安賭場
I'm not driving a stolen getaway car
to a fucking Indian casino.
你拖累我們要晚一天
You just put us
a goddamn day behind.
但這票干的還不錯 所以現在我們扯平了
Well, I got us a day ahead
this morning, so I guess we're even.
不用謝我 - 謝你大爺
- You're welcome.
- Fuck you.
你不能自己接電話嗎?
Can't you answer
your own phone?
我在開車 而你只是坐在那裏掰手指
I'm driving. You're just sitting there
twiddling your fat fingers.
非巡警漢密爾頓本人
Ranger Hamilton's phone.
真是太膽大妄為
It's reckless is what it is.
是吸毒犯 相信我
It's tweakers, I'm telling you.
我不覺得他們有那麼魯莽
I don't think these boys
is reckless.
絕對不是吸毒犯
Damn sure ain't tweakers.
他們十分清楚自己在做什麼
They know exactly
what they're doing.
你是不是一定要顯得比別人聰明 才能活下去?
I don't know how you're gonna survive
without somebody to outsmart.
你得有個愛好 易學的那種
You need a hobby, and quick.
騎馬怎麼樣?
How about a horse?
瑪麗·貝絲是騎馬的
Mary Beth was the rider.
馬只會讓我想起她
A horse would only
remind me of her.
喜歡釣魚嗎?
You like to fish.
總不至於每天都釣魚吧
Not enough to do it
every goddamn day.
等我退休
Yeah, when I retire,
我要和埃斯米搬到加爾維斯敦
I'm gonna move Esme and me
down to Galveston.
買一條漁船
Buy a fishing boat.
住在個碼頭旁邊 靠他媽打漁生活
Gonna live on that son of a bitch
right at the pier.
哦 誰知道呢?
Oh, who knows?
說不定那些個搶劫犯來場槍戰
Maybe one of these bank robbers
is gonna want a gunfight
那我就可以戴著光榮勳章退休了
and I can dodge my retirement
in a blaze of glory.
你的槍法我可見識過
Well, I've seen you shoot.
和光榮這兩字半點都沾不上邊
There won't be much glory in it.
哦 至少我還是挺幸運的
Oh, well, I'm lucky
邊上有個會替我報仇的混血兒
I got a half-breed by my side
to avenge me.
希望你保持清醒久一點
If you can stay sober
long enough,
應該知道你們原住民有多貪戀杯中物
knowing how you lnjuns
like the bottle.
Whoa.
Hey!
你們在幹嘛 放火燒地?
What you all doing?
You burning this field?
我們吃飽了撐的嗎?
Why in the shit
would we do that?
這火是公路那邊來的 追我們很久了
This kicked up on the highway,
been chasing us ever since.
真希望我能幫上你的忙
Wish we could do
something for you.
還是讓它把我燒成灰來解脫我吧
Ought to just let it turn me to ashes,
put me out of my misery.
剪了那個籬笆
Cut that fence.
都21世紀了 我還在趕牲口與火災比賽著過河
21st century, I'm racing a fire
to the river with a herd of cattle.
總算知道我家孩子為什麼不想幹這行了
And I wonder why my kids
won't do this shit for a living.
走起來 快走
Move 'em out.
Come on.
快 快 快
Go, go! go-
你要請求支援嗎?
You wanna call it in?
等它燒到布拉索斯河 自己就會滅的
Oh, it's gonna burn out
when it hits the Brazos.
再說這荒山野嶺的哪兒找得到什麼支援
No one to call
around here, anyway.
這些小子只能靠自己了
No, these boys is on their own.
我還是不明白有什麼問題 托比
I still don't see the problem, Toby.
你還是...
You still don't...
問題在於 拜你所賜
Well, the problem is,
thanks to you,
我們必須挨到明早 再去搞輛車來
we have to spend tomorrow morning
getting another car,
所以週三得搶兩家銀行
so we'll have to hit two banks
on Wednesday.
我們今天已經搶了三家了
We already done three today.
別擔心了
Stop worrying.
這是誰的地盤?
Whose land is this?
傑瑞米·喬克
Jeremy Chalker.
他讓我待在這裏 條件是幫他打土狼
He lets me stay here in exchange
for shooting coyotes.
冰箱裏有冰啤酒
Cold beer in the fridge.
你偷了我的帽子
You stole my hat.
是借
I borrowed it.
你他媽對它做了什麼?
What the fuck you do to it?
這是什麼? - 我的一家一當
- What's this?
- My livelihood.
我們用不著全帶上
We don't need all this.
總不能天天把槍放在房車上啊
Can't keep the guns
in the trailer days on end.
顯然也不能帶進銀行
That's not coming with us
in the bank.
和出納員談談吧
Just spoke to the teller.
她有點嚇壞了
She's a little shook up.
可能她的駕照被拿走了
Perp took her driver's license,
用以威脅家人 使她閉嘴
threatened her family
if she talked to us.
請問你叫什麼名字 這位年輕的女士?
Mind if I ask you
your name, young lady?
娜塔莉·馬丁內斯
Natalie Martinez.
好的 娜塔莉 我希望你知道
Well, Natalie,
I want you to know
在我們抓到這些歹徒之前...
we're gonna have some officers
watching your house extra careful
會派警員守在你家附近
till we catch these buggers.
我向你保證
You have my word on that.
不止一個歹徒嗎?
There's more than one?
搶銀行的只有一個嗎?
Only one man robbed the bank?
是的 - 他長什麼樣?
- Yeah.
- What'd he look like?
他穿的像個牛仔 但戴了滑雪面具
He was dressed like a cowpoke
except for the ski mask.
他好像逃進了停在餐館外面的車裏
I think he ran to a car
that was parked out front of the diner.
你看到有車?
You saw the car?
綠色的車
It was green.
幾成新的樣子? - 我不是很懂車 先生
- How old?
- I don't know cars, mister.
好吧 那看起來是輛好車 還是一般的車
Well, was it a nice car,
an okay car,
或者是超級破爛車?
or a real piece of shit?
超級破爛車
It was a real piece of shit.
好的 現在我們有點線索了
All right.
Now, we're getting somewhere.
那邊來了一個有錢買屋的男人
Oh, that looks like a man
who could foreclose on a house.
我先走一步了 納塔利
Excuse me, Natalie.
打擾一下 行長先生
Excuse me, Mr. Banker.
納塔利 在你父親抵達前 我派警員與你一起
Natalie, I'm gonna have the officer
stay with you till your father arrives.
好嗎? - 好的
- All right?
- Okay.
你今早有沒有碰巧錄到監控 有嗎?
Didn't happen to have your surveillance
cameras on this morning, did you?
當然
Of course.
所以你們拍到這起搶劫了
Oh, so you have
the robbery on video.
這是當然
Of course we do.
如果沒有監控 我們還算是銀行嗎?
What kind of bank would we be
if we didn't have video surveillance?
顯然德州米蘭德銀行例外
Oh, you'd be
a Texas Midlands Bank.
好的 那我們有錄像了
All right, we've got video.
我去街角漢堡店瞭解下情況 拜託仔細看下錄像?
Care to give it a watch
while I wander over to the burger joint?
能幫我順便帶點吃的嗎?
Would you order me something
while you're there?
我好餓 - 我懷疑他家有沒有乾肉餅賣（北美印地安人的一種主要食品）
- I'm starving.
- I doubt they serve pemmican.
你知道我也算墨西哥人
You know
I'm part Mexican, too.
好吧 如果哪天我玩夠了印第安人的段子
Yeah, well,
I'm gonna get to that
我會記住玩墨西哥人的段子
when I'm through
with the Indian insults,
不過那該是很久以後的事了
but it's gonna be a while.
你們這些巡警都這麼怪嗎?
You rangers are an odd bunch.
不 他是個例外
No, just him.
我們看看錄像吧
Let's take a look at that video.
好 就在這後面
Yeah, it's right back here.
您好
Howdy.
女士
Ma'am.
我猜你知道銀行發生的事吧
Guess you know about
the goings-on at the bank.
我沒注意
I did notice.
今天有外地人來過嗎?
Any out-of-towners
come through today?
詹妮·安在這服務過幾個男的 不是本地人
Jenny Ann waited on a couple of boys,
ain't from here.
哦?
Oh?
我去叫她
I'll go get her.
非常感謝
Appreciate that.
朋友們
Boys.
你們在這坐了挺久了吧?
Y'all been here for a while?
挺久了 久到目擊了那個...
Well, long enough to watch
a bank getting robbed
搶我30年錢財的銀行被搶的全過程
that's been robbing me
for 30 years.
所以你看見他們了?
Oh, you say you've seen them?
我可以十分確定說 他們是坐在那吃的午飯
I'm pretty sure they were sitting
right over there having lunch.
其中一個高
One of them was tall.
另一個矮
The other one was short.
都和牛仔一樣瘦
They's both lean like cowboys.
要我說的話 看起來像是兄弟
Looked like brothers
if you ask me.
你是德州巡警嗎?
You the Texas Ranger?
是的 女士
Yes, ma'am.
和我談談你服務的那幾個年輕英俊的陌生人吧
Tell me about those handsome
young strangers that you waited on.
誰說英俊了?
Who said handsome?
相信我
I did.
鑒於你沒有衝到停車場向我...
Based on the fact that you didn't
meet me in the parking lot,
抱怨有兩個外地人...
hollering about
the two out-of-towners
搶銀行之前還在這吃飯的事實
eating here
right before a bank robbery.
他們又沒說會搶銀行
Well, they didn't mention
they was robbing the bank.
他們付的現金嗎?
They paid cash?
那也算犯罪嗎?
That a crime now?
他們給了多少小費?
How much did they leave?
多少?
How much?
200美元
$200.
他們在搶銀行前就給了 所以...
And they left it before
the bank was robbed, so...
在搶銀行前
Uh, before this bank
was robbed.
我要看看他們給的錢
I'm gonna need
to see them bills.
女士 - 不行
- Ma'am.
- Mm-mm.
女士 他們的錢是證據之一
Ma'am, them bills is evidence.
只有確定他們是銀行搶劫犯才算證據
Mm-mm, it's evidence
if they're the bank robbers.
在那之前 這是我的小費
Till then, it's my tip.
這可是我房子月供的一半
And half my mortgage.
所以麻煩你去那邊拿到證據之後
So, you go out there
and you get a warrant,
再來這裏要走這筆
and you come after the money
這筆錢用來保證我女兒不會睡大街
that I will be using to keep a roof
over my daughter's head.
有個男人搶了銀行 正如她所說的
One man hit the bank,
just like she said.
是的 格子襯衫 釘扣領子
- Yeah.
- Checkered button-down shirt,
牛仔褲 滑雪面具
jeans, ski mask.
錄像上都有
- That's all the video will tell us.
- Yep. Yep.
花格襯衫 就是他了
Checkered shirt.
That is him.
他們在那坐過 給了她200美元小費
They were sitting right over there.
Tipped her $200.
去和廚房裏的...
Go wrestle a description
大號野蠻女友講講道理吧
from that big sassy girl
in the kitchen.
你自己沒搞定?
You didn't get it yourself?
還有 把她那筆小費拿到手 我們得檢查他們的錢
Oh, and get that tip from her.
We're gonna check them bills.
祝你好運
Good luck.
是啊 我遭到了頑強抵抗
Yeah, I'd expect some resistance.
哦 還有 阿爾貝托
Oh, and, Alberto,
打電話給287號的旅館 給咱們留間房
call that motel on 287,
get us a room.
我們要在這過夜?
We're gonna stay the night?
這可是犯罪現場
Well, this is where the action is.
太蠢了
Seems foolish.
怎麼講?
What's that?
靠打劫銀行 然後好命花錢的好日子...
The days of robbing banks
and trying to live to spend the money...
已經一去不復返了
they're long gone.
絕對是陳年舊歷了
Long gone for sure.
賈斯汀長大後想做什麼?
What does Justin want to do
when he's grown?
他現在夢想為德州A＆M大學打橄欖球
Right now he's dreaming
of slinging a football for A&M.
他和你太像了
He's a lot like you.
我敢肯定這讓你很眼羨 - 超乎你的想像
- I bet that puckers your red eye.
- More than you know.
我活了39年 10年在監獄裏
39 years of life, 10 in jail.
如果他總是與我背道而馳 倒是正確的方向
If he turn left where I turned right,
he'll be okay.

In your last days in the nursing home,
you'll think of me and giggle.
為什麼上帝? 你為什麼不回應我的祈禱?
Why, God?
Why won't you answer my prayers?
你祈求他的幫助
You begged him for help,
回首生活 卻發現一無改變
and yet you look around at your life
and nothing is different.

And so you assume
that God has told you no.

Come on, I'd rather dance
around the fire with a spear.
你看這節目還不如用長矛捅我算了
I'd rather have you stab me
with a spear than watch this.
這個王八蛋他不懂上帝
This son of a bitch,
he wouldn't know God
除非他能捲起褲腿 咬自己的老二
if he crawled up his pant leg
and bit him on the pecker.
他媽的換台
Change the damn channel.
現在這才是上帝正在看的

what God watches right here.

哇哦 看這孩子
Wow, look at this boy run.
長角牛隊今年的隊伍不錯啊
Longhorns are gonna have
a good team this year.
足球這種運動真不能理解
That soccer,
never could understand that.
五歲小屁孩能做到的運動不能算運動
Anything a 5-year-old can do
ain't a sport.
誰發明的 阿芝特克人嗎?
Who invented it? Aztecs?
把骷髏頭之類的踢來踢去 是吧?
Kickin' around skulls
or something, right?
聽起來更像科曼奇人的運動
Sounds like a Comanche sport.

in your own room.
哦 那還有什麼樂子?
Oh, where's the fun in that?
知道嗎 阿爾貝托?
You know what, Alberto?
怎麼?
What?
用不了一年
In a year's time,
你就會想念我的各種玩笑了
it's my teasing
that you're gonna miss.
你給我上墳、問候我的時候...
It's what you'll laugh about
就會覺得我的玩笑好笑了
when you stand over my grave
and wish me well.
老天 我真希望那就是明天啊
God, I hope that's tomorrow.

Are you fucking kidding me?
幹什麼呢?
What are you doing?
睡在門廊 規劃我的未來
Sleeping on the porch,
practicing my future.
我們這行當很危險
It's a dangerous thing
we do for a living.
你很走運...
You're lucky...
已經看穿紅塵
having seen it through
to the end.
我也希望能有那麼幸運
I hope I'm that lucky.
哦 其實
Oh, well.
沒有我跟你搭檔 恐怕你距離罪犯太近...
Without me by your side,
I doubt you'll get close enough
早就險境纏身了
to a criminal to ever be
in danger again.
我才想對你抱歉呢
Just when I was starting
to feel sorry for you.
印第安人才不對牛仔抱歉
Indians ain't supposed
to feel sorry for cowboys.
反過來才對
It's the other way around.
你這算遺囑執行人嗎?
And this makes you the executor?
嗯哼
Mm-hmm.
不管他們怎麼起訴我們 都無法奪走是嗎?
So, no matter what they charge us with,
they can't take it away?
賭場的資金無法追蹤吧?
There's no way to trace funds
from a casino, all right?
你一旦把支票交給銀行  信託是無形的
Once you get the checks to the bank,
trust is untouchable.
你跟誰都不會說一個字是吧?
You can't tell
nobody nothing, right?
有什麼好說的呢?
Well, what is there to tell?
我的意思是這錢你們倆是賭博贏來的 是吧?
I mean, you boys won
that money gambling, didn't you?
32000美元 付清倒按揭借款
$32,000 pays off
the reverse mortgage.
那些畜生從2012年至今都在抽財產稅
And those bastards paid
the property tax from 2012 to now.
額外的11000美元
That's another $11,000.
一共43000美元 就兩清了
So, $43,000
and you are free and clear.
只要再讓信貸員給我傳真一張留置權解除證明
Just have the loan officer
fax me a release of lien,
我再轉交雪佛龍的租賃管理人
and I'll get that over
to the lease manager at Chevron.
傳真號碼在這張名片上 - 好的
- The fax number is on the card.
- Okay.
你幹這單能掙多少錢?
How much you making
on this deal?
掙的不夠我冒的風險
Not near as much as I'm risking.
那你為什麼還干?
Why you doin' it, then?
你知道嗎 他們付給你的借款能少則少
You know, they loaned
the least they could.
只夠讓你老媽窮的有個基本承諾收益
Just enough to keep your mama poor
on a guaranteed return.
最後只用了25000刀買走她的地皮
Thought they could swipe
her land for $25,000.
太狂了 恨得我牙癢癢
That's just so arrogant,
it makes my teeth hurt.
看到你們倆…
To see you boys...
用那幫畜生自己的錢還給自己?
pay those bastards back
with their own money?
如果這不是德州人作風 我都不知道什麼是了
Well, if that ain't Texan,
I don't know what is.
多謝了
Thank you.
他們星期五就會取終止抵押品的贖回權
Now, they can foreclose
on Friday.
你們就算赴湯蹈火
Come hell or high water,
也要在星期四趕到柴爾裏德斯的銀行

on Thursday.
他們那群混蛋會提早結束營業的
Knowing them fuckers,
they will close early.
會及時到達的 - 叫我托比
- We'll be there.
- Oh, and, Toby.
信託必須經由銀行
The trust needs to be managed
by a bank.
你們真的想要隱藏資金的流向嗎?
You really wanna cover
your tracks?
你們得找德州米德蘭來搞這個信託
You get Texas Midland
to handle this trust.
*名人T骨咖啡 營業中*
那麼 計劃是?
So, what's the plan?
盯著那家銀行
We're gonna watch that bank
like a deer feeder.
時間會證明我們是對的
In time, we'll be right.

You know, I've been working here
for 44 years.
還沒有人點過...
Ain't nobody
ever ordered nothing
除了T骨牛排以外的東西
but T-bone steak
and a baked potato.
除了一位從紐約來的二貨
Except this one asshole
from New York
1987年 那時他想點三文魚
tried to order trout
back in 1987.
我家從來不賣特奶奶的三文魚
We don't sell
no goddamned trout.
只賣T骨牛排
T-bone steaks.
但你可以不要玉米棒子
So, either you don't want
the corn on the cob,

the green beans.
所以 你不要什麼?
So, what don't you want?
我不要青豆
I don't want green beans.
我也不要青豆
I don't want green beans either.
牛排三分熟
Steaks cooked medium rare.
我的牛排可以燒的... - 不許多嘴
- Can I get my steak cooked...
- That weren't no question.
好吧
All right.
給你們冰茶
Iced tea for you boys.
冰茶不錯
Iced tea would be great.
冰茶 謝謝 大姐
Iced tea, yep.
Thank you, ma'am.
嗯哼
Uh-huh.
好吧 我告訴你件事
Well, I'll tell you one thing.
沒人會搶劫這個老太婆
Nobody's gonna rob
this son of a bitch.
相信我
My word.
感覺她怎麼樣?
How's she feel?
跑的不錯
She runs good.

她贏過冠軍?
She got a top?
到底怎麼樣
How she came.
我們要她了
We'll take her.
星期五 再報告失竊
Don't report it stolen till Friday.
雪佛龍的那夥計又減少了租賃協議條款
The guy from Chevron
is dropping off the lease agreement.
你獨自處理沒問題吧?
Are you okay dealing with that
by yourself?
一個人去黛比那裏行嗎?
You okay being with Debbie
by yourself?

Remember,
he ain't the enemy.
拿上文件走人 還要說謝謝
Just take the papers,
say thank you.
那個油商才是敵人 別犯錯

make no mistake.
他不是我們的目標
He just ain't ours.
我天黑前就回農場
I'll be back to the ranch by dark.

開車得像個模範教師 畢竟後面裝了一大堆玩意

我以為你會賣掉牧場
I guess you'll be selling
the ranch.
它是孩子們的了
It goes to the boys.
是嗎 - 嗯
- Really?
- Mmm.
它算進信託里了
It's been put in a trust.
什麼意思?
What's that mean?
就是說沒有人能賣掉它
It means no one can sell it.
這下好了
Great.
我又有新東西得照看了
Something else
I got to take care of.

不打算喝嗎?
Ain't gonna drink it?
你讓我不要像你一樣 卻給我啤酒
You tell me not to be like you,
and then you offer me a beer.
到底要怎樣?
Which is it?
好孩子
Good boy.
孩子們還好嗎? - 你在幹什麼?
- How are the boys?
- What are you doin'?
做些保險措施
Insurance.
我不想車上帶那個破玩意兒
I don't want that shit in the car.
老兄 我們下次會開兩輛車
We'll be running two cars
next time, brother.
我帶上它們
They'll ride with me.
所以 這就是你的計劃?
So, this is your plan?
我們就這樣坐在這裏
We're just gonna sit here
檢驗這家分行是不是會被他們搶劫
and see if this is the branch
they rob next.
那你又會怎樣做?
What would you rather do?
你願意驅車80英里去奧爾尼...
You wanna drive 80 miles
back to Olney
找那些根本就沒有蹤影的指紋嗎?
and look for more fingerprints
that we ain't gonna find?
還是你想開200英里回盧博克市
Or you wanna drive 200 miles
back to Lubbock
去看那些無關緊要的臉部照片 因為壓根就沒有人...
and look at mugshots that don't matter
'cause nobody knows
知道這些王八蛋長什麼樣?
what these sons of bitches
look like?
不然 我們就在這等著他們搶這家銀行
Or we can just wait here
for them to rob this bank,
而我又十分確定他們一定會來的
which is the one thing I'm pretty
damn sure they are going to do.
我知道你想幹嘛
I know what you're doing.
你在盡力拖延時間
You're trying to make this last
as long as you can
拖得時間越長
because the longer it lasts,
你離門廊構想的未來就越遠
the farther you are
from that front porch.
沒有 我在等這些傢伙犯錯
No, I'm waitin' for these boys
to make a mistake.
目前還沒有 但他們肯定會出岔子
So far they ain't, but they will.
而且就會在這家銀行
And they're gonna make it here.
所以 放輕鬆
So, just relax.
好好享受小鎮的生活吧
Enjoy this little town.
你想住在這裏嗎?
Do you wanna live here?
只有一家古老的五金店
Got an old hardware store
物品售價是家得寶（美國家居連鎖店）的兩倍
that charges twice
what Home Depot does,
還有一家餐館 女招待的皮膚堪比響尾蛇(的尾環)
one restaurant with
a rattlesnake for a waitress.
我是說 這裏的人都怎麼生活?
I mean, how is anybody
supposed to make a living here?
這裏住人有150年歷史
People have made a living here
for 150 years.
那人類還在洞穴裏住了十五萬年呢
Well, people lived in caves
for 150,000 years,
但你現在不會住山洞了啊
but they don't do it no more.
也許你的族人還會這樣做
Well, maybe your people did.
你們那樣的人也會
Your people did, too.
很久之前 你的祖先是印第安人...
A long time ago,
your ancestors was the Indians...
直到另外有人來屠殺他們
till someone came along
and killed them,
把他們趕盡殺絕 把你同化
broke 'em down,
made you into one of them.
150年前 這裏全都是我祖先的土地
150 years ago, all this
was my ancestors' land.
你現在所看到的一切
Everything you can see.
以及你昨天看到的一切
Everything you saw yesterday.
你的祖輩們奪走了一切
Till the grandparents
of these folks took it.
現在 輪到他們被奪取了
And now, it's been taken
from them.
區別是 不再動用武力
Except it ain't no army doing it.
就是那裏邊的王八蛋(銀行家)干的
It's those sons of bitches
right there.
你在想明天的事嗎?
You thinking about tomorrow?
你沒想嗎?
Ain't you?
那個小酒店的前台妹
The little hotel clerk.
為什麼那些看起來甜美的人兒
Why is it always the sweet ones
一旦狂暴起來 會變得那麼狂放?
that are such devils
when you get them revved up?
不知道 從沒遇見甜美型的
Wouldn't know.
Never had a sweet one.
你喜歡他們狂放 似乎在找人洩憤
Yeah, you like them pissed off,
lookin' for someone to blame.
的確是那樣啊
Sure seems that way.
你做的很不錯
It's a good thing you're doing.
是我倆做的
We're doing it.
明天對銀行出納員好點
Go easy on the bank teller
tomorrow.
我會像年輕護士那樣的溫柔
I'll be as gentle
as a young nurse.
你來嗎?
You coming?
馬上
On my Way-
嘿
Hey.
該死
Shit.
早上好
Morning.
你想要早餐嗎?
You want some breakfast?
好啊 聽起來不錯
Yeah, breakfast sounds good.
我們先去傑頓分行 再去科爾曼分行 對嗎?
So we hit the Jayton branch first,
then Coleman, right?
好的 這應該差不多夠數了
Yeah, that should get us
what we need.
動手吧
Let's do this.
媽的 該死
Ugh... shit.
計劃可他媽的不是這樣
That's not part of the fucking plan.
那群混蛋把這家分行給關了
The bastards closed down
the branch.
現在怎麼辦 老弟?
What now, little brother?
去科爾曼分行
Coleman.
你他媽的在幹什麼? - 我們得去一趟郵局鎮
- What the hell you doing?
- We gotta head to Post.
你他媽的在幹什麼 - 得去...
- What the hell are you doing?
- Get...
我們得去一趟郵局鎮 - 你在說什麼?
- We got to head to Post.
- What are you talking about?
我們必須去一趟郵局鎮
We got to head to Post.
我們先去科爾曼
We're going to Coleman.
科爾曼只有一名出納
There's only one teller in Coleman.
無論如何都是不夠數額的
Whatever we get won't be enough.
我們現在就得去科爾曼
We go to Coleman right now.
如果那裏不夠的話就去郵局鎮
If that ain't enough,
we head to Post.
如果現在不去郵局鎮 那就得中午才能到
If we don't leave now for Post,
we won't get there till noon.
你可不想午飯時間搶銀行吧?
You don't wanna rob a bank
at lunchtime, do you?
我們又不知道那邊當地人的習慣
Yeah, we don't know the patterns
of folks out there.
這種習慣 都是一樣的
The patterns
are the same everywhere.
這些城鎮都僵化了 郵局鎮也是一樣
All these towns are dead.
Post ain't no different.
那可是家大銀行
It's a bigger bank.
我們得把你的車留在城外
We'll leave your car
just out of town.
快點吧
Come on, now.
操
Shit.
我想我弄懂了
I think I got this figured.
前兩家銀行 都是德州米德蘭銀行
First two banks,
they were Texas Midland Banks.
好了 米德蘭銀行一共有七家分行
All right, there are seven
branches altogether.
總行在沃思堡市
The main branch is in Fort Worth.
他們是不會去那裏的
They're not gonna mess with that.
他們去了奧爾尼分行
All right, they hit
the branch in Olney.
去了阿徹城的那家
They hit the one in Archer City.
這裏還有一家 - 他們還未搶劫
- Then there's the one here.
- Which they did not hit.
阿爾貝托 你可以跟著我的思路來嗎?
Alberto, will you please
follow me?
閉上嘴 別多話
Don't let... just keep
your mouth shut
好好聽著 我要說什麼
and just listen
to what I'm gonna say.
這有一家...
There's the one here...
柴爾德裏斯還有一家
then there's the one
in Childress.
傑頓還有一家
There's the one in Jayton.
這家關門了
That one's closed.
我知道這家關門了!
I know that one's closed!
我知道這家關門了 阿爾貝托
I know that one's closed,
Alberto.
我想說的是...
That's my point.
傑頓那家關門了
Jayton is closed.
就只剩郵局鎮了
That just leaves Post.
他們不會去搞柴爾德裏斯的分行
They're not gonna mess
with the bank in Childress.
那鎮子發展很不錯
That's a fairly
decent-sized town.
弗農那家不是米德蘭的 也被他們搶劫了
The branch in Vernon
wasn't Midlands and they hit that.
對 他們其中一個去的 就一個人
Yeah, one of them did.
Alone.
他一直跑過馬路 去車那邊
Then he ran all the way
across the road to get to the car.
他的同夥顯然都沒有料到會發生這件事
I think his partner had no idea
that was gonna happen.
這對我們有什麼價值呢?
What does that mean to us?
這說明他們唯一會去的地方就是郵局鎮
It means that the only branch
that fits the bill is in Post.
那好吧 咱們去吧
Well, then let's go.
這地方看起來很繁忙
The town looks busy.
有一點
Little bit.
相信我
My word.
這家太大了
It's too big.
這話她說的
That's what she said.
這很不妙
It's no good.
哎 這又不是你的首秀了
Aw, this ain't your first rodeo.
銀行越大
Bigger bank...
錢越多
more money.
所有人 都他媽趴到地上!
Everybody,

他媽的趴在地上!
Get on the fucking ground!
小姐 他媽的趴在地上 現在!

Get in the car!
別讓他們跑了!
Don't let them get away!
你在後面還好嗎 弟弟?
How you doing back there,
little brother?
你他媽的竟然殺人了
You fucking killed them.
那些偷偷帶著傢伙的人...
These concealed carry permits
顯然也是劫匪吧?
sure complicate
a bank robbery, don't they?
不是我的錯 鬼知道今天是發薪日
It's not my fault it was payday.
這次太出格了 阿坦
This has gone too far, Tan.
本來不應該有人死的
No one was supposed
to fucking die.
不是他們死就是我們亡 自己選
It was them or us.
Take your pick.
是的 說吧 瑪格麗特
Yeah, go, Margaret.
德州米蘭德郵局鎮剛剛遭遇搶劫
Texas Midlands in Post
has just been hit.
我說什麼來著?
Ah! What did I tell you?
好
Yeah.
嗯  - 當地的警察正在追捕他們
- Yeah!
- Locals are in chase.
嫌犯駕駛著一輛...
Suspects escaping west
破舊的野馬向西邊逃去
in an old Bronco.
明白了 瑪格麗特 保持聯絡 我們正趕過去
All right, Margaret, keep us posted.
We're on our way there.
給我一個印第安式的嚎叫 來吧
Give me an Indian whoop.
Come on.
那些小子們要吃癟了
These boys are gonna go down.
來點飄飄然的音樂
Let's get some giddy-up music
going on there.
不要這曲
Oh, please, not that.
耶
Yeah.
嘿 趕緊緩過來
Hey, hey. Come on.
Snap out of it.
快他媽給我緩過來
Snap the fuck out of it.
媽的 給我看看 你中彈了
Shit, let me see that.
You're hit.
孩子 你被槍打中了 轉過去
Boy, you're hit.
Get the back.
你會活下來的 百分百沒問題
Well, you'll live.
It's a through and through.
壓緊傷口 然後包紮好 必須緊緊包紮住
Compress it. Wrap it up.
You got to wrap it up tight.
前後都要包紮 前後
Front and back,
front and back.
包紮緊點
Wrap it tight.
噢 兄弟 現在給我認真聽好了
Oh, brother, hear me now,
hear me clear.
如果你不想成為你孩子生命中的污點
Unless you wanna be a black mark
on your sons' lives,
拿出點美洲獅精神來
I need you mountain lion mean.
聽到了嗎?
You hear me?
聽到了
I hear you.
美洲獅精神 - 對
- Mountain lion mean.
- Yeah.
會沒事的 一切都會好的
Yeah. It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.
堅持住
- Hold on.
- Yeah.
快走
Go.
給 把錢拿著
Here, take the money.
咱們走 - 去賭場那
- Let's go.
- Get to the casino.
按計劃洗錢
Change the money
like we planned.
這是你的計劃 這計劃確實有效
This was your plan,
and it worked.
每一步都是
Every step of the way.
相信自己
Trust it.
你準備去哪兒?
Where are you headed?
別傻了
Don't be stupid.
我愛你 托比
I love you, Toby.
我認真的
I mean it.
我也愛你
I love you, too.
嘿 托比 去你媽的
Hey, Tobe, go fuck yourself.
去你媽的
Go fuck yourself.
*陽光燦爛的早晨我信步而行*
As I walked out
one sunny morning
*一眼瞅見牛仔哥邁著大步*
I spied a young cowboy
a loping along
*他的帽子掛在背後*
His hat was laid back
*他的馬刺叮叮的響*
His spurs were a jinglin'
*他走近我的時候 唱著這首歌*
And as he come near me
He's singing this song
*咿辟咳咿吼 你這小狗狗*
Yippee hiyiyo.
You little doggies.
*這是你的不幸 而不是我的*
It's your misfortune
and none of my own
這就是所謂白人的直覺
This is what they call
white man's intuition.
也叫瞎貓抓到死老鼠
Sometimes a blind pig
finds a truffle.
*這是你的不幸 而不是我的*
It's your misfortune
and none of my own
快後退 噢 靠!
Back up! Oh, shit!
快 快 快走!
Go! Move!
相信我
My word.
好吧 看來我們需要一支特警隊
All right, We're gonna need
a SWAT unit up here
和一架直升飛機 來抓那兩個傢伙了
and a helo to pin
these boys down.
嫌犯是一名白人男性
Suspect is a white male.
所有人散開
Guys, spread it out!
對方持有槍械 彎腰!
He's got a rifle.
Get down!
對方持有槍械 彎腰!
He's on the ridge!
He's on the ridge!
我看見他了!
Come on, I see him!
只有一個人嗎?
There's just one?
是的 只有一個人
Yep, just one.
本來是有兩個人的
There's supposed
to be two of them.
也許在鎮上就抓住了一個
Maybe the town folks got one.
那麼抓住的那個 肯定是聰明出主意的人
Well, if they did,
they got the smart one.
這老小子簡直瘋了
This old boy
is out of his mind.
你不如翻越峽谷 用斧襲這混蛋?
Why don't you slip up this canyon
and tomahawk that son of a bitch?
巡警犧牲 請求支援
Ranger down.
Call it in.
快倒車 後退 讓這些皮卡車都後退!
Get back! Back!
Back those trucks up!
後退!
Get back!
讓那些卡車都後退
Get these trucks back.
快後退!
Back up!
讓他們後退
Back them up.
你熟悉這的地形嗎?
How well do you know the land
around here?
瞭如指掌
Like the back of my hand.
那好 他就藏在那個山脊樹叢裏
All right, he's hid up
in that brush on that hill.
能讓我繞到他後面去嗎?
Can you get me up there
behind him?
給我30分鐘 可以拿下那混蛋
Give me a half hour,
I'll have that bastard
後面的地形正好能給我的車做掩護
field dressed on the hood
of my truck.
你沒必要這麼做 只管帶我過去
I can't let you do that.
You just get me there.
如果真像你說的那樣 那可足足500碼遠
That's gonna be a 500-yard shot
if he's where you said.
只管帶我過去!
Just get me there!
操
Shit.
你好嗎?
How are you doing?
還好 你呢?
Good. You?
你準備去哪兒呢?
Where are you headed?
魯伊多索
Ruidoso.
你從哪兒來的?
Where you from?
哈姆林
Hamlin.
選這麼個荒涼的路線?
Taking the scenic route?
選了條唯一能走的路而已
Taking the only way I can.
他們封了郵局鎮的路線
They got the road closed
at Post.
每一條下口都被封了
Everywhere you turn
they got the road closed.
帶駕照了嗎? - 是的 我帶了
- You got your license on you?
- Yes, I do.
在這稍等一下
Wait right there.
好的 長官
Yes, sir.
先生 - 嗯
- Sir.
- Yeah.
一路順風
Have a good day.
多謝
Thanks much.
你有點喘不上氣啊
You're pretty winded.
你應該讓我來開槍 見鬼了 這可是我的槍
You oughta let me take the shot.
Hell, it's my gun.
現在不是了
Not on your life.
他是我的
He's mine.
就在樹的左邊
Just left of the tree.
我來搞定他
I got him.
我看到你了
I got you.
平原之王
Lord of the Plains.
就是我
That's me.
德州高速路巡邏隊和當地警察
Texas Highway Patrol
and the locals
在我身後的山上追趕搶匪
chased the robbers
to this hillside behind me,
鎮子西邊的20里外 交火依然在繼續
20 miles west of town,
where the gunfight continued.
現在我們得知
And right now we do know
巡邏警察馬庫斯·漢密爾頓借用當地居民的一把來福槍
Ranger Marcus Hamilton
killed one of the gunmen
擊斃了其中一個持槍嫌犯
using a rifle he actually borrowed
from a resident here.
我們現在還不清楚這個嫌犯的名字
We don't know the name
of that suspect yet...
真走運
Lucky guy-
時間卡得剛剛好
Just in the nick of time, too.
這種概率不太有
What are the odds?
好吧 現在這筆錢
Now, this, uh, satisfies
正好能還清倒按揭借款和...
both the reverse mortgage loan
and the, uh...
我們替你母親代付的稅款
and the back taxes that we've paid
on your mother's behalf.
當然 我們這麼做是出於好心
We do that as courtesy,
of course.
請把留置權解除證明傳真給這個號碼
You can fax the release of lien
to that number.
一個律師?
An attorney?
好的 嗯 我會把東西傳真發過去...
All right, well, I'll... I'll get that
faxed over to your attorney
在這週末之前
by the end of the week.
現在就是週末 我要親眼看著你做
It is the end of the week.
I wanna watch you do it.
這需要點準備時間
Well, it takes a little time
to prepare.
我一天都有空
I got all day.
有了
Here we go.
好的 就這樣
Okay. That's it.
很榮幸與你接洽
And it's been a pleasure
doing business with you.
問你個問題
Let me ask you a question.
你們有信託業務嗎?
Do y'all manage trusts?
嘿 馬庫斯 你不是退休了嗎?
Hey, Marcus,
ain't you supposed to be retired?
你好
Howdy.
雪莉 - 很高興看見你
- Shelley.
- Nice to see you.
你好 馬庫斯 - 嘿 瑪格麗特
- Well, hey, Marcus.
- Hey, Margaret.
當一陣子老百姓的滋味怎麼樣?
Been awhile.
How's life as a civilian?
就 你知道的...
Oh, just, you know...
我可以看一下霍華德的檔案嗎?
Think I can take a peek
at Mr. Howard's file?
坦納·霍華德
Tanner Howard.
行了 我沒有更好的差事可幹
Oh, come on.
I ain't got nothing better to do.
在我的桌子上
It's at my desk.
呃
Uh...
他在一次狩獵事故中 殺了他父親是吧?
Killed his father
in a hunting accident, huh?
我倒是想知道四月份的穀倉里 有什麼可以狩獵的
I'd love to know what he was hunting
in the barn in April.
因嚴重傷害罪 被關押在亨茨維爾十年
10 years in Huntsville
for aggravated assault.
他的獄友於2012年被釋放
Cellmate was released in 2012.
獲刑7年 他因搶劫大斯普林市銀行...
Before that,
he served seven years
被提起公訴
on bank robbery charges
up in Big Spring.
一直試圖追捕其獄友 但至今仍是未果
Been trying to track him down,
but no luck so far.
你們都忽略了他的兄弟嗎?
You all are off the brother?
他和這些搶劫案毫無關係
There's nothing that links him
to the robberies.
那弗農市的小服務員又怎麼解釋?
Now, what about
that little waitress in Vernon?
我們給她看了照片
Yeah, we showed her photos.
她說不認識他
She said she didn't
recognize him.
而且你拿走她的小費 令她極其沮喪
Pretty upset you took
her tips as evidence.
她絕對在搞事
She sure was sassy.
你把照片給那位老油子看了嗎?
You show that
to that old timer?
看了 他說他不像是那個用餐的小伙
Yep. He said he didn't look
like the fella from the diner.
他也沒認出坦納來
He didn't recognize
Tanner's photo either.
想法庭判令調查他的銀行賬戶和農場
Yeah, tried to get a court order
on his bank accounts and the ranch,
地檢官才不會做這事
DA wouldn't do it.
托比案底清白 沒有任何犯罪記錄
Toby's got no record.
He's never been arrested.
唯一出庭記錄是離婚案
His only court appearance
was at his divorce.
他並不符合案情 馬庫斯
He don't fit the bill, Marcus.
人不是一出生就會搶劫的
People don't start out
robbing banks.
是要慢慢升級的 比如他的混蛋哥哥
They graduate to it
like his asshole brother.
再說 我們到那的時候
Besides,
when we was out there,
看見兩組雪佛龍的員工
we saw two crews from Chevron
一組蓋井帽 一組安裝石油鑽井
capping wells
and putting in pumpjacks.
現場工程師說這裏將會...
Engineers out there
said they're gonna pull
每月產出2000桶原油
2,000 barrels a month
off that place.
你覺得法官會給你授權...
You just try convincing a judge
to issue warrants on somebody
以搶劫管理信託的銀行四萬美元為名立案
set to clear $50,000 a month
而那人卻每月淨入5萬美元
for robbing $40,000 from the bank
that manages the family trust.
米德蘭管理信託業務?
Midland manages the trust?
你認為銀行是想查個水落石出
You'd think they'd want
this thing figured out.
我覺得銀行什麼都不在乎
I don't think the bank cares
about anything
除了維持該信託的正常運行
but keeping that trust
right where it is.
該死 銀行方面比托比的律師還不肯配合
Hell, they were less cooperative
than Toby's attorney.
馬庫斯 他不是嫌疑犯 你也已經退休了
Marcus, he's not a suspect
and you are retired.
哦 聽你的
Oh, I hear you.
你喜歡這桌子嗎?
You like my desk?
至少不討厭
I don't hate it.
嘿 回頭見 馬庫斯
Hey, I'll see you, Marcus.
知道我是誰嗎?
Know who I am?
我是殺了你哥哥的人
I'm the man
who killed your brother.
我知道
I know.
我還知道你已經退休 你這算擅闖
I also know you're retired
and you're trespassing.
哦 你現在就可以斃了我 你的權利
Well, you could shoot me now
and be within your rights.
你手扣在扳機上 多方便
You toting a gun and all,
how convenient.
我猜你也有一支
I figure you got one, too.
介意我坐會兒嗎?
Mind if I sit?
進來吧
Go ahead.
啤酒?
You want a beer?
可以 我再也不用執勤了
Sure.
I ain't on duty no more.
謝了
Thanks.
在這坐著吹著小風真愜意
It's nice out here
in this breeze, huh,
儘管現在已經降溫了
now that it's cooled down.
你怎麼做到的?
How did you do it?
算我沒說
Oh, never mind.
哦 沒關係 我會及時搞清楚的
I'll figure that out in time.
為什麼?為什麼要幹那事?
Why?
Why did you do it?
我可以理解你哥哥坦納的動機
I know why your brother,
Tanner, did it.
他搶銀行是因為他喜歡
He robbed them banks
because he liked it.
他在300碼外射死了我的同事 就因為他喜歡
He shot my partner 300 yards away
'cause he liked it.
...覺得爽
It made him feel good.
如果不是我一槍射爆他的腦漿
If I hadn't blown
his shit for brains out,
這門口該有另外一輛嶄新的皮卡 並外掛水上摩托
there'd be a new truck out front
with jet skis
或者他想買啥就買啥
or whatever else
he could think to buy.
他會花光所有錢 好給他藉口再去偷
He'd spend it all just to give
an excuse to steal some more.
但你不這樣
But not you.
沒給這裏買什麼新東西...
There's nothing new
around here...
除了鑽井
except them pumpjacks.
這些機器傢伙每個月...
Each one of them
making you a month
給你賺的錢大大超過你兄弟倆連搶四家銀行的總和
what you and your brother stole
from all four banks combined.
那麼幫我想想
Help me understand, then.
幫我想明白都有四個人丟了性命...
Help me understand
why four people died...
似乎你們搶來的錢 並沒有花掉
so you could steal money
that it don't seem you've spent,
感覺這錢並不是急需的
that it don't seem you need.
你有家人嗎?
You got a family?
我搭檔 一大家子人
My partner had a family.
A big one.
他們家後院可沒有石油鑽井
They don't got no pumpjacks
in their backyard.
我沒殺你的朋友 - 不 你殺了
- I didn't kill your friend.
- Yes, you did.
你幕後策劃的一切
By setting this thing
in motion.
你覺得我會相信是你腦抽的哥哥策劃的一切?
You expect me to believe
your dimwitted brother planned this?
才不 策劃很聰明
Oh, no.
This was smart.
聰明的是你
This was you.
我窮了一輩子
I've been poor my whole life.
我父母窮 祖父母也窮
So were my parents,
their parents before them.
貧窮就像個遺傳病...
It's like a disease...
一代又一代地傳下去 變成頑疾
passing from generation to generation,
becomes a sickness.
就是這樣
That's what it is.
傳染給你認識的每一個人...
Infects every person you know...
但我兒子不能再窮下去了
but not my boys.
不可以
Not anymore.
現在這屬於他們
This is theirs now.
我一生從來沒殺過人
Now, I ain't never killed
no one in my life,
但如果你想讓我從你開刀 老人家
but if you want me to start with you,
let's get on with it, old man.
看看你抽出手槍之前 我能否一槍轟翻你
See if you can grab that pistol
before I blast you off this porch.
你好 - 怎麼回事?
- Howdy.
- What's going on?
家豬回家了啊
The hogs are back
in the garden.
野豬開道 動物兇猛
Feral hogs tearing up this place
something fierce.
這是哪位?
Who's this?
我是你丈夫的一個老朋友
I'm an old friend
of your husband.
是前夫
Ex-husband.
我只是來裝修房子的
I'm just working on the house.
哦 你不住在這裏?
Oh, you don't live here?
不 這裏不屬於我 是他們的房產
No, it's not mine.
It's theirs.
哦
Oh.
造福後代的事情
The things we do
for our kids, huh?
那麼
Well...
我最好走了
I best be going.
女士
Ma'am.
我也走了 黛比 我要去洗洗乾淨
Me, too, Debbie.
I'm gonna wash up,
大概明天9點回來完成前門的活兒
be back around 9:00 tomorrow
to finish the front.
然後準備粉刷其餘部分
Start painting the extension
等蘭迪放學回家後
and then help Randy
with his homework
和他完成作業 好嗎?
when he gets back
from school, okay?
好的
Okay-
嘿
Hey.
我在鎮上租了一間小屋
I rent a little house in town.
如果你想找我繼續這個談話
If you wanna stop by
and finish this conversation,
隨時歡迎
you're welcome anytime.
哦 我會的
Oh, I'd like that.
回頭見了
I'll be seeing you.
是啊 很快 我想
Yeah.
Soon, I hope.
我準備好了結這一切了
I'm ready to be done
with this.
你永遠都不會了結 無論是什麼
You'll never be done with it
no matter what.
它會伴隨你終身 孩子
It's gonna haunt you, son,
for the rest of your days.
但你不孤獨
But you won't be alone.
它也會伴隨我終身
It's gonna haunt me, too.
如你有空拜訪 也許我會給你安寧
If you stop by,
maybe I'll give you peace.
也許吧 也許是我給你安寧
Maybe.
Maybe I'll give it to you.
