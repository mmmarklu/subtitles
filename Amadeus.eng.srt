1
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,959
Mozart!

2
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,958
Mozart!

3
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,628
Forgive your assassin!

4
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,630
I confess, I killed you!

5
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,759
Si, I killed you, Mozart.

6
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,997
Mozart, pietà!
Forgive your assassin!

7
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,434
Forgive me, Mozart!

8
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,109
Signore Salieri,
open the door, be good now!

9
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,553
Signore, we have
something special for you.

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,719
Something you' re going to love.

11
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,551
Is that good !

12
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,349
Signore, believe me. . .

13
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,758
. . .this is the most delicious thing
I ever ate in my life!

14
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,672
Really, you don't know
what you' re miss--

15
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,317
All right, that's enough!
Open the door.

16
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,757
Signore, if you don't
open this door. . .

17
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,713
. . .we' re gonna leave nothing
for you.

18
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,992
And I' m never gonna come
see you again!

19
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,836
Good morning, Father.

20
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,992
Herr Salieri?

21
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,916
Leave me alone.

22
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,717
I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.

23
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,872
Do you know who I am?

24
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,075
That makes no difference.

25
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,353
All men are equal in God's eyes.

26
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,672
Are they?

27
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,040
Offer me your confession.

28
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,958
I can offer you God's forgiveness.

29
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,918
How well are you trained in music?

30
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,076
I know a little.
I studied it in my youth.

31
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,428
-Where?
-Here in Vienna.

32
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,511
Then you must know this.

33
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,069
I can't say that I do.

34
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,434
What is it?

35
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,598
It was a very popular tune in its day.

36
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,994
I wrote it.

37
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,230
Here, how about this?

38
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,710
This one brought down the house
when we played it.

39
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,752
Well?

40
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,829
I regret it is not too familiar.

41
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,190
Can you recall no melody of mine?

42
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,312
I was the most famous composer
in Europe.

43
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,988
I wrote 40 operas alone.

44
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,272
Here!

45
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,755
What about this one?

46
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,512
Yes, I know that!

47
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,154
That's charming !

48
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,238
I' m sorry, I didn't know
you wrote that.

49
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,877
I didn't.

50
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,920
That was Mozart.

51
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,716
Wolfgang . . .

52
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,549
. . .Amadeus Mozart.

53
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,192
The man you accuse yourself
of killing .

54
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,596
You've heard that?

55
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,717
Is it true?

56
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,953
For God's sake, my son. . .

57
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,596
. . .if you have something to confess,
do it now.

58
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,560
Give yourself some peace.

59
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,037
He. . .

60
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,152
. . .was my idol.

61
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,230
Mozart.

62
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,829
I can 't think of a time
when I didn't know his name.

63
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,758
I was playing games. . .

64
00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:00,078
. . . when he was playing music
for kings and emperors.

65
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,840
Even the pope in Rome.

66
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,795
I admit, I was jealous. . .

67
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,192
. . . when I heard the tales
they told about him.

68
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,675
Not of the brilliant little prodigy. . .

69
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,556
. . .but of his father,
who had taught him everything.

70
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,991
My father, he did not care for music.

71
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,993
When I told him. . .

72
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,590
. . . how I wished I could be
like Mozart. . .

73
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,032
. . .he would say, ''Why? Do you want
to be a trained monkey?

74
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,995
You 'd like me to drag you around,
doing tricks like a circus freak?''

75
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,796
How could I tell him. . .

76
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,595
. . .what music meant to me?

77
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,192
While my father
prayed earnestly to God. . .

78
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,960
. . . to protect commerce. . .

79
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,231
. . .I would offer up. . .

80
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,510
. . .secretly. . .

81
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,117
. . . the proudest prayer
a boy could think of.

82
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:19,438
''Lord, make me a great composer.

83
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,468
Let me celebrate your glory
through music. . .

84
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,353
. . .and be celebrated myself.

85
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,280
Make me famous through the world.

86
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,080
Make me immortal.

87
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,717
After I die. . .

88
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,550
. . .let people speak my name
with love for what I wrote.

89
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,796
In return. . .

90
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,751
. . . I will give you my chastity. . .

91
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,230
. . . my industry. . .

92
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,396
. . . my deepest humility,
every hour of my life.

93
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,356
Amen. ''

94
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,874
And do you know what happened?

95
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,111
A miracle!

96
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,798
My life changed forever.

97
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:29,110
I knew God had arranged it all .
That was obvious.

98
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,392
One minute I was a frustrated boy. . .

99
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,309
. . .in an obscure little town.
The next I was here. . .

100
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,512
. . .in Vienna, city of musicians. . .

101
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,195
. . .and Emperor Joseph,
the musical king.

102
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:49,155
In a few years, l was his court
composer. isn't that incredible?

103
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,477
Every night l sat with
the emperor of Austria. . .

104
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,432
. . .playing duets with him. . .

105
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,154
. . . correcting the royal sight-reading.

106
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,750
Actually, the man had no ear at all .

107
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,000
But what did it matter?

108
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,431
He adored my music.

109
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,997
Tell me. . . .

110
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,515
If you had been me. . .

111
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:20,432
. . .wouldn’t you have thought
God had accepted your vow?

112
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,435
And believe me, I honored it.

113
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,195
I was a model of virtue.

114
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,635
I kept my hands off women.

115
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:34,118
I worked hours every day
teaching students, many for free!

116
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,314
Sitting on endless committees
to help poor musicians.

117
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,034
Work, that was all my life.

118
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,276
And it was wonderful .

119
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,875
Everybody liked me.

120
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,910
I liked myself.

121
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,280
Until he came.

122
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,358
He came to Vienna to play
some of his music. . .

123
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,798
. . .at the residence
of the Prince Archbishop of Salzburg .

124
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,271
Eagerly, l went there to seek him out.

125
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,276
That night. . .

126
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,155
. . . changed my life.

127
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,755
As l wandered through the salon. . .

128
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,554
. . .l played a little game with myself.

129
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,992
This man had written
his first concerto at the age of 4. . .

130
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:40,955
. . .his first symphony at 7,
a full-scale opera at 12!

131
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,510
Did it show?

132
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,720
is talent like that. . .

133
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,593
. . . written on the face?

134
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,354
Which one of them. . .

135
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,152
. . . could he be?

136
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,109
Mozart is not here.

137
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,354
-Stop it!
-I am.

138
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,835
-Stop it!
-I am stopping it.

139
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,953
I am! I' m stopping it. Slowly.

140
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:15,438
There. You see? I've stopped .

141
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,551
-Now we' re going back.
-No!

142
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,320
Yes! You don't know where you are.

143
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,954
Here, everything goes backwards.

144
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:28,076
People walk and dance and sing
and even talk backwards.

145
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:32,912
-That's stupid .
-Why? People fart backwards.

146
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,637
Ssa-ym-ssik!

147
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,638
Ssa-ym-ssik!

148
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,115
Yes, you are. You are very sick.

149
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:44,596
No! Say it backwards, shit wit!

150
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,991
Ssa-ym-ssik.

151
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,437
Ssik, kiss.

152
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,029
Ym, my. Ssa.

00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,674
Kiss my ass.

154
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,834
Em-yrram!

155
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,634
-I' m not playing !
-Say it, it's serious.

156
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,159
It's very serious.

157
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,677
Yrram.

158
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,076
Marry me.

159
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,752
I' m not gonna marry you.
You' re a fiend .

160
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,279
Uoy-evoI-I-tub.

161
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,598
Tub.

162
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,552
But I . . .

But I love you?

165
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,438
-Tihs-ym-tae.
-What?

166
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,512
-Eat.
-Eat.

167
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,598
-Ym, my.
-My.

168
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,518
Tihs. Eat my shit.

169
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,156
You filthy fiend !

170
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,158
You filthy--!

171
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,470
My music.

172
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,995
They've started without me.

173
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,509
That was Mozart!

174
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,675
That giggling, dirty creature
I'd just seen crawling on the floor.

175
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,996
-I think that went well, don't you?
-Indeed .

176
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,556
The Viennese know good music,
don't you think?

177
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,749
Certainly.

178
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,310
Your Grace.

179
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,558
Ah, Mozart.

180
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,513
-Why?
-Why what, sir?

181
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,474
Why do I have to be humiliated
in front of my guests. . .

182
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,910
. . . by one of my own servants?

183
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,510
The more license I allow you,
the more you take.

184
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,474
If His Grace is not satisfied,
he can dismiss me.

185
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,556
I wish you to return immediately
to Salzburg .

186
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:08,514
-Your father is waiting for you there.
-No, Your Grace!

187
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:13,830
I would prefer you dismissed me.
It's obvious I don't satisfy.

188
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:19,194
I have no intention of dismissing you.
You will remain in my service. . .

189
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,960
. . .and learn your place.

190
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,678
On the page it looked. . . .

191
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,598
Nothing!

192
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:04,679
The beginning simple, almost comic.

193
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,359
Just a pulse.

194
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,070
Bassoons, basset horns. . .

195
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,158
. . .like a rusty squeezebox.

196
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,428
And then, suddenly. . .

197
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,756
. . . high above it. . .

198
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,595
. . .an oboe.

199
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,837
A single note, hanging there,
unwavering .

200
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,712
Until . . .

201
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,718
. . .a clarinet took it over. . .

202
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:44,272
. . .sweetened it into a phrase
of such delight.

203
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:52,193
This was no composition
by a performing monkey.

204
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:58,115
This was a music I had never heard .

205
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:04,594
Filled with such longing,
such unfulfillable longing .

206
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,791
It seemed to me l was hearing
the voice of God.

207
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,194
Excuse me.

208
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,312
But why?

209
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:19,879
Why would God choose an obscene child
to be his instrument?

210
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,470
It was not to be believed .

211
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:27,117
This piece had to be an accident.
It had to be.

212
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,678
It better be.

213
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,995
How good is he, this Mozart?

214
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:41,558
He's remarkable, Majesty. I heard an
extraordinary opera of his last month.

215
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:45,031
-Idomeneo, King of Crete.
-That?

216
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,234
A tiresome piece. I heard it too.

217
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,074
Tiresome?

218
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,073
A young man trying to impress
beyond his abilities.

219
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,555
Too much spice.

220
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,799
Too many notes.

221
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,594
Majesty. . .

222
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:05,190
. . .it was the most promising work
I've heard in years.

223
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,870
Then, we should make
some effort to acquire him.

224
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:13,232
We could use a good German composer
in Vienna, surely?

225
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:17,917
I' m sure he could be tempted
with the right offer. Say. . .

226
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,996
. . .an opera in German
for our National Theater.

227
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,349
Excellent, sire!

228
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:27,192
But not German. I beg, Your Majesty.

229
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:31,598
Italian is the proper language
for opera.

230
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,394
All educated people agree on that.

231
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,669
What do you think, chamberlain?

232
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,352
In my opinion, it's time
we had a piece in our own language.

233
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:49,833
Plain German for plain people.

234
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,154
Kapellmeister?

235
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,873
Majesty. . .

236
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:00,197
. . . I must agree with Herr Direttore.

237
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,750
German is. . .

238
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,396
. . .too brute for singing .

239
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,114
Court composer. . .

240
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,836
. . .what do you think?

241
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,719
I think it's an interesting notion
to keep Mozart in Vienna.

242
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,559
It should infuriate the archbishop. . .

243
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,674
. . .if that is Your Majesty's
intention.

244
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:33,236
You are cattivo, court composer.

245
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:40,155
I want to meet this young man.
Arrange a pleasant welcome for him.

246
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,274
Well, there it is!

247
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,673
This is a beautiful wig for you.

248
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:21,668
It looks so marvelous and I I’ve it.

249
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,074
The other one.

250
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:28,356
Here is the other one.
I think you will I’ve it.

251
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:35,075
Here's the third one. So? Here we go.

252
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:38,795
-How do you like it?
-They' re all so beautiful !

253
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,639
Why don't I have three heads?

254
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,916
This is funny!

255
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,354
Three heads!

256
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,794
Gentlemen.

257
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,833
-Good morning .
-Morning, Your Majesty.

258
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,155
What do you have for me today?

259
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,309
-Your Majesty, Herr Mozart.
-Yes, what about him?

260
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,391
He's here.

261
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,437
Well, there it is. Good !

262
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:12,919
I hope you won't find it improper,
but I've written a march in his honor.

263
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,999
What a charming idea, court composer.
May I see?

264
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,519
Just a. . . .

265
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,280
Just a trifle, of course.

266
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,714
May I try it?

267
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,990
Let's have some fun.

268
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,912
Delightful, court composer!

269
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,714
May I play it when he comes in?

270
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,235
-You do me too much honor.
-Bring in Herr Mozart.

271
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,032
But slowly.

272
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,754
I need a minute to practice.

273
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,554
Good, continue.

274
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,076
G, Majesty.

275
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,911
Excellent!

276
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,636
Good, Majesty.

277
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:41,156
Continue. Very good .

278
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,879
Very good, Majesty.

279
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,434
Tempo! Up.

280
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:53,189
Lightly, then strongly!
It's a march, Majesty.

281
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,958
Again.

282
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,311
Bravo, Majesty!

283
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,994
Gentlemen, please.
A little less enthusiasm, I beg you.

284
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:48,349
No, please. It's not a holy relic.

285
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,795
You know, we have met before.
In this very room.

286
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,710
You don't recall . You were only 6.
He was giving a delightful concert!

287
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,874
As he got off the stool, he fell .

288
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,789
My sister Antoinette helped him up.
Know what he did?

289
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,710
He jumped into her arms and said,
""Will you marry me? Yes or no?""

290
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,109
You know all these gentlemen.
The Baron Van Swieten.

291
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:22,915
-I' m a great admirer of yours.
-Thank you.

292
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,712
Kapellmeister Bonno.

293
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,834
My pleasure.

294
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:31,510
The Director of Opera,
Count Orsini-Rosenberg .

295
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,792
Sir, yes. The honor is mine,
absolutely!

296
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:40,034
Here is our
illustrious court composer. . .

297
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,071
. . . Maestro Salieri .

298
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,717
At last, such immense joy!

299
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,351
I know your work well .

300
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:54,951
You know, I composed some variations
on a melody of yours.

301
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,993
-Really? Which one?
- ''Mio Caro Adone. ''

302
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,519
I' m flattered .

303
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:02,712
A funny tune,
but it yielded good things.

304
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,673
And now he has returned
the compliment.

305
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:09,316
Herr Salieri composed
this little march for you.

306
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,112
Really?

307
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,793
Well, there it is.

308
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,120
Down to business. We' re going
to commission an opera from you.

309
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,117
What do you say?

310
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,636
Did we vote in the end
for German or Italian?

311
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:32,314
Sire, if you remember,
we did finally incline to Italian.

312
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,476
Did we?

313
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:39,314
I don't think it was really decided,
Your Majesty.

314
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,633
-German. Please let it be German.
-Why so?

315
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:48,719
Because I've already found
the most wonderful libretto.

316
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,076
Have I seen it?

317
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,639
I don't think you have, Herr Direktor.
It's quite new.

318
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:00,038
-I'll show it to you immediately.
-I think you'd better.

319
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,559
Well . . .

320
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,914
. . .tell us about it.
Tell us the story.

321
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,869
Well, it's quite amusing, Majesty.

322
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:16,596
It's set--
The whole thing is set in a. . . .

323
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,394
Yes? Where?

324
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:28,434
In a harem, Majesty. In a seraglio.

325
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,871
-You mean in Turkey?
-Yes, exactly.

326
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:37,158
Then why especially
does it have to be in German?

327
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:42,715
It doesn't, especially. It could be
in Turkish if you really want.

328
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:47,717
No, my dear fellow, the Language
is not finally the point.

329
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:53,278
Do you really think that subject
is appropriate for a national theater?

330
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:56,278
Why not? It's charming .

331
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:02,511
I mean, I won't actually show
concubines exposing their. . . .

332
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:06,470
It's not indecent.
It's highly moral, Majesty.

333
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:09,353
It's full of proper German virtues.

334
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:13,712
Excuse me, Majesty, but what
do you think these could be?

335
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,718
Being a foreigner, I'd I’ve to learn.

336
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,351
Well, tell him, Mozart.

337
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,989
Name us a German virtue.

338
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,033
-Love, sire.
-Oh, I’ve!

339
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,630
Of course, in Italy
we know nothing about I’ve.

340
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,356
No, I don't think you do.

341
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:39,951
Watching Italian opera,
all those male sopranos screeching . . .

342
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:45,917
. . .stupid, fat couples rolling their eyes
about. That's not I’ve. It's rubbish!

343
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,476
Majesty, you choose the Language.

344
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:55,037
I'll set it to the finest music
ever offered a monarch.

345
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:58,710
Well, there it is.
Let it be German.

346
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,108
This is yours.

347
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,914
Keep it.
It's already here in my head .

348
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,192
What? On one hearing only?

349
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,517
I think so, sire. Yes.

350
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,478
Show us.

351
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,793
The rest is just the same, isn't it?

352
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:54,193
That doesn't really work, does it?

353
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,554
Did you try. . . ?

354
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:02,199
Shouldn’t it be a bit more. . . ?

355
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,198
Or this?

356
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,311
This. Yes.

357
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,200
Better? What do you think?

358
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,474
Grazie, Signore.

359
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:06,594
All l ever wanted
was to sing to God.

360
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,997
He gave me that longing . . .

361
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,592
. . .and then made me mute. Why?

362
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,797
Tell me that.

363
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,475
If he didn't want me
to praise him with music. . .

364
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,353
. . .why implant the desire. . .

365
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:27,478
. . .like a lust in my body?

366
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,269
And then deny me the talent?

367
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,952
Madame Cavalieri is here
for her lesson, sir.

368
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,752
Maestro.

369
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,314
Well . . . ?

370
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,554
How do you like it?

371
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,273
It's Turkish.

372
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:53,837
My hairdresser said everything
this year's going to be Turkish.

373
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,798
Does he?

374
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,837
What else did he tell you today?

375
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,390
Come, come! Give me some gossip.

376
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:12,590
Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart.

377
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,035
News travois fast in Vienna.

378
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,678
And he's been commissioned
to write an opera. Is it true?

379
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,472
-Yes.
-Is there a part in it for me?

380
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:29,274
-No.
-How do you know?

381
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,995
-Do you know where it's set, my dear?
-Where?

382
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,952
In a harem.

383
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:39,071
-What's that?
-A brothel .

384
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,393
Come.

385
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,157
Let's begin.

386
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,990
-What does he look like?
-Mozart?

387
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,760
-You might be disappointed .
-Why?

388
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:58,752
Looks and talent don't always
go together, Katerina.

389
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,633
Looks don't concern me, maestro.

390
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:05,913
Only talent interests
a woman of taste.

391
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,550
Shall we continue?

392
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,631
There she was.

393
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,598
l don 't know where they met or how.
There she stood!

394
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,075
On stage, for all to see.

395
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:59,159
Showing off like
the greedy songbird she was.

396
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:36,039
Ten minutes of ghastly scales.
Arpeggios!

397
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:40,153
Whizzing up and down
like fireworks at a fairground.

398
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,789
Understand, I was
in I’ve with the girl .

399
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,671
Or at least in Lust.

400
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,912
And I swear to you,
I never laid a finger on her.

401
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:11,194
All the same, I couldn’t bear
to think of anyone else touching her.

402
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:14,198
Least of all, ""the creature. ""

403
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:58,076
Brava, madame!
You are an ornament to our stage.

404
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,474
Your Majesty.

405
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:06,832
Well, Herr Mozart. A good effort.

406
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,678
Well, decidedly that.

407
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:12,429
An excellent effort!
You have shown us something . . .

408
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:17,157
-. . . quite new tonight.
-It is new.

409
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,828
-It is, isn't it, sire?
-Yes, indeed .

410
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:24,238
So then, you liked it?
You really liked it, sire?

411
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:27,318
Well, of course I did ! It's very good !

412
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:31,399
Of course, now and then,
just now and then. . .

413
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,068
. . .it seemed a touch. . . .

414
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,237
What do you mean, sire?

415
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:41,513
Well, I mean, occasionally,
it seems to have. . . .

416
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,549
How shall one say. . . ?

417
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,469
How shall one say, direktor?

418
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:53,070
-Too many notes, Majesty?
-Exactly. Very well put.

419
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:57,319
-Too many notes.
-I don't understand .

420
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:01,877
There are just as many notes
as I required, neither more nor Less.

421
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,640
My dear fellow, there are in fact. . .

422
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:08,594
. . .only so many notes
the ear can hear in an evening .

423
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:14,592
I think I' m right in saying that,
aren't I, court composer?

424
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:18,876
Yes. On the whole, yes, Majesty.

425
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:20,993
This is absurd !

426
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:25,273
Young man, don't take it too hard .
Your work is ingenious.

427
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,072
It's quality work.

428
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:32,593
And there are simply too many notes.
Just cut a few and it'll be perfect.

429
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,990
Which few did you have in mind?

430
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,598
Wolfgang !

431
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:41,233
Wolfgang, my dear!

432
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:46,719
-Wolfgang !
-Majesty, this is Frau Weber.

433
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,309
She's my landlady.

434
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:57,113
-Enchanted, madame.
-Sire, such an honor!

435
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:03,717
This is my dear daughter, Constanze.

436
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,549
-She's the fiancée of Herr Mozart.
-Really?

437
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:14,877
How charming . Please.

438
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,198
Well . . .

439
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,995
. . .when do you marry?

440
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:40,509
We haven't exactly received
my father's consent yet.

441
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:44,548
Not entirely. Not altogether.

442
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:51,631
-Excuse me, but how old are you?
-26.

443
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:56,438
My advice is for you to marry
this charming young lady. . .

444
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,791
-. . .and stay with us in Vienna.
-You see?

445
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,992
I told him that,
but he won't listen to me.

446
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:06,829
Your Majesty,
you give such wonderful . . .

447
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:11,552
. . .such royal advice. May I . . . ?

448
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:23,239
Well, there it is.

449
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:26,999
WoIfie, will you get some water?

450
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:32,398
Will you get some water, please?

451
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:38,709
WoIfie, get some water!

452
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,518
Excuse me. Excuse me.

453
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:58,591
Did you know?

454
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,955
-What?
-The marriage.

455
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,950
What does it matter to you?

456
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:11,790
Nothing . He can marry who he pleases,
I don't give a damn.

457
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,876
How was I?

458
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:19,037
You were sublime.

459
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:22,233
And what did you think of the music?

460
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,596
Extremely clever.

461
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,556
Katerina, I--

462
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:30,239
Excuse me.

463
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:34,470
Is that woman still lying
on the floor?

464
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:39,834
-No, she's fine.
-Oh, I' m so relieved .

465
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:43,438
Dear Mozart,
my sincere congratulations.

466
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:47,875
-Did you like it then?
-How could I not?

467
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:51,790
It's the best music
in Vienna today, don't you agree?

468
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,992
She must be dazzling in bed .

469
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:00,476
I assume she's the virtuoso
in that department.

470
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:04,389
No other reason why
you'd marry someone like that.

471
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:07,279
Come in.

472
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,629
Excuse me.
WoIfie, Mom isn't feeling very well .

473
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:15,432
-Can we go home?
-Yes.

474
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:18,757
No, no, no.
You can't take him away now.

475
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,599
This is his night.

476
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,268
Won't you introduce us, Wolfgang?

477
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,995
Excuse us, Fräulein.
Good night, signore.

478
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:34,395
At that moment l knew,
beyond any doubt. . .

479
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,591
. . .he 'd had her.

480
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:40,190
The creature had had my darling girl .

481
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:50,114
It was incomprehensible!

482
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:53,160
What was God up to?

483
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:57,477
Was it possible I was being tested?

484
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:02,917
Was God expecting me
to offer forgiveness. . .

485
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:05,793
. . .in the face of every offense?

486
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,752
No matter how painful?

487
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,831
It's very possible.

488
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:14,396
But why him?

489
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:20,394
Why choose Mozart
to teach me lessons in humility?

490
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:22,798
My heart was filling up. . .

491
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,992
. . .with such hatred
for that little man.

492
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:31,030
For the first time in my life,
I began to know. . .

493
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:32,878
. . . really. . .

494
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,556
. . .violent thoughts.

495
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:41,549
Every day, sometimes for hours,
l would pray.

496
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,279
Lord . . .

497
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,879
. . . please. . .

498
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:49,678
. . .send him away. . .

499
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:52,519
. . . back to Salzburg .

500
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,475
For his sake. . .

501
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:59,629
. . .as well as mine.

502
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:05,393
-No! I won't have him back.
-But, Your Grace--

503
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:10,754
Your son is an unprincipled,
spoiled, conceited brat!

504
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:14,036
Yes, sir. . .

505
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:16,830
. . .that is the truth.

506
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:23,030
But don't blame him.
The fault is mine, entirely.

507
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:26,073
I was too indulgent with him.

508
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:29,433
Please, Your Grace?

509
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,350
Give him one more chance?

510
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:35,869
You have leave to try.

511
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:40,073
God bless, Your Grace!
I thank Your Grace.

512
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:42,157
I thank you!

513
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:49,918
l write to you with urgent news.
I'm coming to Vienna.

514
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:53,829
Take no further steps
towards marriage until we meet.

515
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:57,999
As you honor the father who has
devoted his life to yours. . .

516
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,998
. . . do as l bid, and await my coming.

517
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:17,674
I now join you
in the holy bonds of matrimony.

518
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,313
Those whom God hath joined together. . .

519
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:24,432
. . .Let no man put asunder.

520
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,759
Beloved father:

521
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:44,239
You say Vienna is the musicians ' city.
To conquer here is to conquer Europe.

522
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:48,069
With my wife l can do it.
One day, when I’m wealthy. . .

523
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:51,590
. . . you'll live with us,
and we'll be so happy.

524
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:05,275
Good morning .
This is my niece, Princess Elizabeth.

525
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:06,674
Your Highness.

526
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:10,077
She's asked me to recommend
a music instructor.

527
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:13,875
-I've come up with an excellent idea.
-Your Majesty!

528
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:16,878
It would be such a tremendous honor!

529
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:21,198
I was thinking of Herr Mozart.
What is your view?

530
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:25,791
It's an interesting idea,
Majesty, but. . . .

531
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,592
Yes?

532
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,276
My concern is to protect you. . .

533
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:36,189
. . .from any hint of favoritism.

534
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:42,033
Favoritism.

535
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,754
-What is this?
-What is what?

536
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:50,557
Why must I submit samples of my work
to a committee to teach a girl?

537
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:53,399
Because His Majesty wishes it.

538
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:56,715
Is the emperor angry with me?

539
00:51:56,920 --> 00:52:01,152
-Quite the contrary.
-Then why not appoint me to the post?

540
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:04,432
You are not
the only composer in Vienna.

541
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:07,791
No. But I' m the best.

542
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:10,511
Mozart.

543
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:15,190
A little modesty
might suit you better.

544
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:23,951
Who is on this committee?

545
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:28,797
Kapellmeister Bonno, Count
Orsini-Rosenberg and Salieri .

546
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:33,357
Naturally, the Italians!
Of course, always the Italians!

547
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:36,234
They' re all musical idiots!

548
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:42,399
-And you want them to judge my music?
-Young man. . .

549
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:46,434
. . .the issue is quite simple.
If you want this position. . .

550
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:50,872
. . .you must submit your stuff,
along with all your colleagues.

551
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:52,877
Must I?

552
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:55,309
Well, I won't.

553
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:58,589
How are we supposed to live?

554
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:02,839
Do you want me to beg on the streets?

555
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:04,996
Don't be stupid .

556
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:08,632
-All they want to see is your work.
-Shit.

557
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:13,550
-What's wrong with that?
-Shut up! Just shut up.

558
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:17,878
One royal pupil,
and all of Vienna will come flocking .

559
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:20,196
They'll come anyway.

560
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:24,190
-No, they won't.
-They I’ve me here.

561
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:28,996
-I know how things work in this city.
-You know everything, don't you?

562
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:57,952
-Yes?
-Excuse me, sir.

563
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:00,993
-A Lady insists on taking to you.
-Who?

564
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:04,590
She didn't say,
but she says it's urgent.

565
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,790
Excuse me, my dear.

566
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:15,072
Your Excellency.

567
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:18,716
How can I help you?

568
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:27,399
-Frau Mozart?
-I've come on behalf of my husband .

569
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:32,993
I brought samples of his work so he
can be considered for the appointment.

570
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:38,519
How charming,
but why did he not come himself?

571
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:42,878
Well, he's terribly busy, sir.

572
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,519
I understand .

573
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,992
I will Look at them the moment I can.

574
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:57,398
It will be an honor.
Please give him my warmest regards.

575
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:01,798
Would it be too much trouble
to ask you to Look at them now?

576
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:05,595
-While I wait.
-I' m afraid I' m not at leisure. . .

577
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:08,234
. . .this precise moment.

578
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:12,194
Leave them with me.
I assure you, they will be safe.

579
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:16,078
I really cannot do that, sir.

580
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:20,030
You see, he doesn't know I' m here.

581
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:24,035
Then he didn't send you?

582
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:27,755
No, sir. This was my own idea.

583
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:33,589
-I see.
-Sir, we' re desperate.

584
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:37,478
We really need this job.

585
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:41,116
My husband spends far more
than he can ever earn.

586
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:45,472
I don't mean that he's lazy,
because he works all day long .

587
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:49,912
It's just that he's not practical .

588
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:54,273
Money simply slips through
his fingers. It's ridiculous.

589
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:59,879
Let me offer you some refreshment.

590
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:02,310
Do you know what these are?

591
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:07,196
Capezzolidi Venere!
Nipples of Venus.

592
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:12,955
They' re Roman chestnuts in brandied
sugar. Try one. Go on, try one!

593
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:15,594
They' re quite surprising .

594
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:22,117
They' re wonderful !

595
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,878
Thank you very much, Your Excellency.

596
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:29,640
Don't keep calling me that.

597
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,994
Keeps me at such a distance.

598
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:36,677
I wasn't born a court composer,
you know.

599
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:38,916
I' m from a small town.

600
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:41,156
Just like your husband .

601
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:46,273
Are you sure you can't. . .

602
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:49,995
. . .Leave this and come back again?

603
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:53,918
It's very tempting, sir.

604
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:57,271
But it's impossible, I' m afraid .

605
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:00,717
He'd be frantic
if he knew they were missing .

606
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:03,639
You see, they' re all originals.

607
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:07,751
-Originals?
-Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.

608
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,718
These. . .

609
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:22,319
. . .are originals?

610
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:58,719
Astounding!

611
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:02,550
It was actually--
It was beyond belief.

612
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:05,834
These were first and only. . .

613
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:08,476
. . . drafts of music.

614
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:15,078
But they showed no corrections
of any kind. Not one.

615
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:20,951
He had simply written down music. . .

616
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:23,993
. . .already finished in his head .

617
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:29,559
Page after page of it.
As if he were just taking dictation.

618
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,911
And music. . .

619
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:41,989
. . .finished as no music
is ever finished .

620
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:47,520
Displace one note. . .

621
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:50,474
. . .and there would be diminishment.

622
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:55,713
Displace one phrase,
and the structure would fall .

623
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:01,674
It was clear to me. . .

624
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:06,034
. . . that sound l had heard
in the archbishop 's palace. . .

625
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:09,073
. . .had been no accident.

626
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:14,670
Here again
was the very voice of God.

627
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:21,274
I was staring through the cage. . .

628
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:24,995
. . .of those meticulous ink strokes. . .

629
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:30,114
. . .at an absolute beauty.

630
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:47,189
Is it not good?

631
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:53,119
It is miraculous.

632
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:01,192
Yes, he's very proud of his work.

633
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:05,590
So you will help us?

634
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:10,512
I dine with the emperor
tomorrow evening .

635
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:14,030
One word from me and the post is his.

636
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:16,913
Thank you, Your Excellency!
Thank you!

637
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:19,595
Come back tonight.

638
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:23,155
-Tonight?
-Alone.

639
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:26,834
What for?

640
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:31,995
Some service
deserves service in return.

641
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:35,192
No?

642
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:40,229
-What do you mean?
-Isn't it obvious?

643
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:44,191
It's a post all Vienna seeks.

644
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:48,188
If you wish it for your husband,
come tonight.

645
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:51,274
I' m a married woman, sir.

646
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:53,072
Then don't.

647
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:55,477
It's up to you.

648
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:59,157
And not to be vague,
that is the price.

649
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:13,997
There is no God of mercy, Father.

650
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:18,998
Just a God of torture.

651
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:26,876
Evening came.

652
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:32,391
l sat there, not knowing
whether she would return or not.

653
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:37,676
l prayed as l had
never prayed before.

654
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,790
Dear God. . .

655
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,275
. . . enter me now.

656
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:47,917
Fill me with one piece of true music.

657
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:53,194
One piece with your breathing it,
so l know that you love me.

658
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:59,157
Show me one sign of your favor,
and l will show mine to Mozart.

659
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:03,759
l will get him the royal position.

660
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:05,832
Enter me.

661
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:07,871
Please.

662
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:11,270
Please!

663
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:18,874
Yes?

664
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:25,599
That Lady is back, sir.

665
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:31,034
Show her in.

666
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:04,912
Well?

667
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:08,191
I' m here.

668
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:14,871
My husband has gone to a concert.

669
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:18,393
He didn't think I would enjoy it.

670
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:31,393
Well, where shall we go?

671
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:35,199
Should we stay here?

672
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:38,272
Well . . . .

673
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:44,393
Do you still want to Look at these?

674
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:50,197
Or don't we need to bother anymore?

675
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,798
Suppose we don't, really.

676
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:51,476
Show this woman out.

677
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:13,593
Stanzi .

678
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:16,991
Stanzi .

679
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:24,397
What is it?

680
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:28,590
What's the matter? Tell me.

681
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:33,591
Tell me.

682
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:40,950
I I’ve you.

683
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:43,995
I I’ve you.

684
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:48,749
From now on, we are enemies.

685
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:50,518
You and l.

686
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:53,439
Because you choose
for your instrument. . .

687
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:58,270
. . .a boastful, lustful,
smutty, infantile boy. . .

688
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:04,197
. . .and give me for reward only the
ability to recognize the incarnation.

689
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:07,633
Because you are unjust. . .

690
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,592
. . . unfair. . .

691
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:12,670
. . . unkind. . .

692
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,598
. . .l will block you.

693
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:16,472
l swear it.

694
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:20,636
l will hinder and harm
your creature on earth. . .

695
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:23,070
. . .as far as l am able.

696
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:26,830
I don't like to talk
against a fellow musician.

697
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:28,473
Of course not.

698
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:30,796
I have to tell you.

699
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:36,708
Mozart is not entirely to be trusted
alone with young ladies.

700
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:38,717
Really?

701
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:42,799
One of my own pupils,
a very young singer. . .

702
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,956
. . . Maria Theresa Paradis. . .

703
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:47,276
. . .told me she was. . . .

704
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,916
Well . . . .

705
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:54,990
Well, what?

706
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:57,995
Molested, Majesty.

707
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:01,351
Twice, in the course of
the same lesson.

708
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:10,038
There is a Herr Mozart
waiting for you in the salon.

709
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:16,633
-Whom did they choose?
-Herr Zummer.

710
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:18,996
Herr Zummer?

711
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:22,715
But the man's a fool !
He's a total mediocrity.

712
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:27,596
No, no. He has yet
to achieve mediocrity.

713
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:33,479
I can't lose this post.
I simply can't.

714
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:36,631
Excellency, please.

715
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:40,674
Let's go to the palace.
You can talk to the emperor. . .

716
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:44,873
. . .and tell him that Herr Zummer
is an awful choice.

717
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:47,992
He could do musical harm
to the princess.

718
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:53,399
Between us, no one in the world
could do musical harm to the princess.

719
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:58,793
Look. . .

720
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,752
. . . I must have pupils.

721
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:03,679
Without pupils, I can't manage.

722
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:07,470
You don't mean
you' re living in poverty?

723
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:10,877
No, but I' m broke.

724
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:13,071
Well, how is this possible?

725
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:16,158
I hear your concerts are
quite successful .

726
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:19,392
They' re stupendously successful .

727
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:23,195
You can't get a seat.
But no one will hire me.

728
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:25,118
They want to hear me play. . .

729
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:29,871
. . . but they won't Let me teach
their daughters, as if I was a fiend .

730
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:36,831
Seriously. . .

731
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:40,271
. . .is there any chance
you could manage a loan?

732
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:44,953
Only for six months.
Eight, at the most.

733
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:49,318
You expect your fortunes to change
in six or eight months?

734
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:52,080
As a matter of fact, I do.

735
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:57,954
I am working on something that will
explode like a bomb all over Europe.

736
01:08:58,160 --> 01:09:03,234
I'll be the richest man in Vienna.
I'll pay you back double. Anything .

737
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:05,351
You name the terms.

738
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:07,596
Well, how exciting .

739
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:10,070
Tell me more.

740
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:15,548
-It's a bit of a secret.
-Come, come. I' m interested .

741
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:18,274
This is delicious. What is it?

742
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:21,878
It's cream cheese mixed with sugar. . .

743
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:26,232
. . .suffused with rum.
Crema Mascarpone Speciale.

744
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:27,993
Italian.

745
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:32,478
Forgive me. We all have
patriotic feelings of some kind .

746
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:34,478
Two thou--

747
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:38,036
Two hundred florins.
That's all I need .

748
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:41,472
A hundred .

749
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:44,999
Fifty.

750
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:49,071
What exactly are you working on?

751
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:54,671
Really, I can't say.

752
01:09:55,360 --> 01:10:01,276
I don't think you should become known
in Vienna as a debtor, Mozart.

753
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:09,557
However. . .

754
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:13,753
. . . I know a distinguished
gentleman I can recommend, and . . .

755
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:15,188
. . . he has a daughter.

756
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:22,400
Quiet! Quiet!

757
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:24,591
Herr Mozart.

758
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:28,349
Welcome. Pay no attention,
they' re impossible.

759
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:31,677
I treat them just like
my own children.

760
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:35,318
Which of them do you wish me to teach?

761
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:40,670
That's funny.

762
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:43,993
You' re a funny fellow.

763
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:48,512
This is the instrument.
I hope it's to your satisfaction.

764
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:51,632
Of course it'll be
to his satisfaction.

765
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:55,549
Come, we' re going to listen
to some music. Come!

766
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:58,111
Good boy.

767
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:04,953
Now.

768
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:09,199
Please play me something,
just to give me an idea.

769
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:12,236
Anything will do.

770
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:14,748
Just go ahead .

771
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:17,758
Just as if we weren't here.

772
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:23,755
Part of music, getting used
to an audience. Right, Herr Mozart?

773
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:27,350
Perhaps it would be better
if we were left alone.

774
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:29,471
We' re both a little shy.

775
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:30,874
Play.

776
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:34,152
-I said play!
-Michael, please.

777
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:38,512
Perhaps if I play first,
it might encourage the Fräulein.

778
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:41,190
Why don't you Let me try?

779
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:54,314
Stop it! Stop!
He always howls when he hears music.

780
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:57,239
We've got to break him of that habit.

781
01:11:57,440 --> 01:12:00,750
We've got to break them
of their habit!

782
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:02,188
Play. Please.

783
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:06,713
Herr Mozart, play. Please, I beg you.

784
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:15,876
That's it. That's it.

785
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:20,915
Keep playing !

786
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:29,518
Keep playing ! That's it!

787
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:51,277
Mozart, that's wonderful !
Wonderful !

788
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:56,156
Next time you wish me to instruct
another of your dogs, Let me know.

789
01:12:56,360 --> 01:12:59,875
Goodbye, Fräulein. Goodbye, madam.
Goodbye, sir.

790
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:56,557
Papa?

791
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:01,838
Papa!

792
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:07,517
Why are you here?

793
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:09,358
Am I not welcome?

794
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:13,991
Of course, welcome.
Papa, welcome! Welcome!

795
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:38,275
You' re very thin.
Doesn't your wife feed you?

796
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:42,632
Of course she feeds me.
She stuffs me like a goose all day!

797
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:47,229
-Is she not here?
-No, she had to help her mother.

798
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:49,158
She's like that.

799
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:52,272
Her mother's a very
sweet woman, you'll--

800
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:02,872
I didn't know you were home.

801
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:06,074
Stanzi, this is my father.

802
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:11,590
We'll wait. We'll wait.

803
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:16,477
Why don't you get up now, my darling?

804
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:26,797
She's very tired, poor creature.
You know me. I' m such a pig .

805
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,798
It's not easy cleaning up after me.

806
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:32,551
Don't you have a maid?

807
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:36,309
Oh. No. We could if we wanted . . .

808
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:40,672
. . . but Stanzi insists on doing
everything herself.

809
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:43,270
How is your. . .

810
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:46,429
. . .financial situation?

811
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:48,671
Couldn’t be better.

812
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:51,471
That's not what I hear.

813
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:54,513
What do you mean? It's wonderful .

814
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:58,872
Really, it's marvelous!
People I’ve me here.

815
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:02,079
They say you have debts.

816
01:16:02,440 --> 01:16:03,873
Who?

817
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:06,317
Who says that?

818
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:08,750
That's a malicious lie!

819
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:11,076
Do you have pupils?

820
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:14,518
I don't want pupils!

821
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:17,069
They get in the way.

822
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:20,879
I have to have time for composition.

823
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:23,998
Composition doesn't pay.
You know that.

824
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:26,077
That one will .

825
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:28,477
What's that?

826
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:31,512
It's a secret.

827
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:34,598
Secret?
You don't have secrets from me.

828
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:41,199
No! Please! I don't want you to see it.
I don't want anyone to see it.

829
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:43,356
You'll be so proud of me.

830
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:47,872
It'll be the best thing I've
ever done. The best thing anyone--

831
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:51,394
There she is!

832
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:55,593
Look at her! Isn't she beautiful?
Now, Papa, confess it.

833
01:16:55,800 --> 01:17:00,271
-Could you want a prettier daughter?
-Stop it, WoIfie!

834
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:03,076
I Look dreadful .

835
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:05,679
Are you. . .

836
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:07,950
. . .expecting?

837
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:11,948
-Yes, I am.
-Isn't it marvelous? We' re delighted .

838
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:17,112
-May I offer you some tea?
-Who wants tea? Let's go out!

839
01:17:17,320 --> 01:17:20,949
This calls for a feast.
You don't want tea, do you?

840
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:25,278
I know! Let's go dancing .
Papa loves parties, don't you?

841
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:28,631
How can you be so boring? Tea!

842
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:34,557
Come on, Papa. Hurry!

843
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:36,478
Here we go. Good day.

844
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:18,873
Now!

845
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:28,717
I name the penalty!
I name the penalty!

846
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:32,153
And the penalty is. . . .

847
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:36,273
-Give her a good one!
-Show us your legs!

848
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:42,675
Come on, come on!

849
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:57,274
It's just a game, Papa.

850
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:11,112
Thank you.

851
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:38,872
Herr Mozart, why don't you
name your son's penalty?!

852
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:43,872
Yes, Papa. Name it.

853
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:48,478
Name it. I'll do anything
you say. Anything .

854
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:53,509
I want you to come back
to Salzburg with me.

855
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:57,110
The penalty must be
performed in the room.

856
01:19:57,320 --> 01:19:59,151
I' m tired of this game.

857
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:03,917
But my penalty!
I've got to have a penalty!

858
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:10,390
I name a penalty!

859
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:14,479
The penalty is. . .

860
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,116
. . .you shall play our tune. . .

861
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:21,757
. . .in the manner of
Johann Sebastian Bach!

862
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:50,358
-Turn him over!
-Over?!

863
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:54,879
Now you play it backwards!

864
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:25,472
-Another one! Give me another one!
-Play it like Gluck!

865
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:28,319
-Boring . Another!
-Handel !

866
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:30,875
I don't like him! Another one!

867
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:33,476
Play Salieri .

868
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:37,636
Now that is a challenge!
That is a challenge.

869
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:40,719
Please! Please!

870
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:16,593
Go on. Mock me. Laugh!

871
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:24,113
That was not Mozart laughing, Father.

872
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:25,878
That was God .

873
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:30,551
That was God Laughing at me
through that obscene giggle.

874
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:36,069
Go on, Signore. Laugh.

875
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:40,319
Show my mediocrity for all to see.

876
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:44,393
One day I will laugh at you.

877
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:50,158
Before I Leave this earth. . .

878
01:22:50,360 --> 01:22:53,033
. . . I will Laugh at you.

879
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:16,480
-WoIfie?
-What?

880
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:20,278
There's a young girl here to see you.

881
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:21,913
What does she want?

882
01:23:22,120 --> 01:23:26,477
She won't talk to me.
She says she has to speak to you.

883
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:29,273
Damn.

884
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,228
Yes?

885
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:39,838
-Are you Herr Mozart?
-That's right.

886
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:45,235
My name is Lori, sir.
I' m a maidservant.

887
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:49,228
I was asked to come here
and offer my services to you.

888
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:54,389
They'll be paid for by an admirer
of yours who wishes to remain. . .

889
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:56,477
. . .anonymous.

890
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:59,873
Is this your idea, Papa?

891
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:01,994
Mine?

892
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:06,352
-Are you playing a trick on me?
-I've never seen this girl .

893
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:10,710
-Is this some kind of joke?
-Not at all, sir.

894
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:13,195
Young woman, this won't do.

895
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:17,632
My son can't accept such an offer,
no matter how generous. . .

896
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:22,152
-. . . unless he knows who's behind it.
-I can't tell you that, sir.

897
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:25,432
-This is ridiculous!
-What is ridiculous?

898
01:24:25,640 --> 01:24:28,234
WoIfie has many admirers in Vienna.

899
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:31,079
People send us gifts all the time.

900
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:34,192
You cannot accept her
without references.

901
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:37,233
Well, this is none of your business.

902
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:41,035
-Whoever sent you is going to pay?
-That's right.

903
01:24:41,240 --> 01:24:45,438
Splendid ! Now we' re going
to Let a stranger into our house.

904
01:24:45,640 --> 01:24:48,677
Who is we? Who is letting who--?

905
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:55,874
-Could you please wait outside?
-Yes, ma'am.

906
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:57,354
Look, old man!

907
01:24:57,560 --> 01:25:01,872
We spend a fortune on you,
and all you can do is criticize.

908
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:03,274
-And now--
-Stanzi !

909
01:25:03,480 --> 01:25:07,792
No! It's right that he should hear!
I' m sick to death of it.

910
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:11,356
We can't do anything
right for you, can we?

911
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:15,235
You won't have to do anything
for me ever again.

912
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:17,032
I' m leaving .

913
01:25:17,240 --> 01:25:20,232
-No, Papa.
-I won't stay and be a burden.

914
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:22,271
No one calls you that.

915
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:25,790
She does. She says I sleep all day.

916
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:27,752
And so you do!

917
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:31,032
The only time you come out is to eat.

918
01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:34,390
Well, what do you expect?

919
01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:41,150
Do you expect anyone to walk out
into a mess like this every day?

920
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:45,956
-So now I' m a bad housekeeper!
-So you are. It's a pigsty.

921
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:48,276
When can you start?

922
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:50,596
-Right away, ma'am.
-Good .

923
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:19,279
They' re out every night, sir.

924
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:23,471
Thank you, sir.

925
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:27,077
Do any pupils come to the house?

926
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:30,996
Not that I've seen.

927
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:33,873
Then how does he pay for all this?

928
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:37,070
Does he work at all?

929
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:42,957
Yes, sir. All day Long . He never
leaves the house till evening .

930
01:26:43,160 --> 01:26:46,072
He just sits there,
writing and writing .

931
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:47,998
Really?

932
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:51,475
What is it he's writing?

933
01:26:54,360 --> 01:26:56,794
I wouldn’t know that, sir.

934
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,718
Of course not.

935
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:00,831
You' re a good girl .

936
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:03,349
You' re very kind to do this.

937
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:07,997
The next time you' re sure they'II
be out of the house, Let me know.

938
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:17,034
Thank you, sir.

939
01:28:52,280 --> 01:28:54,680
l think l found out
about the money.

940
01:28:56,360 --> 01:28:58,280
Yes? What?

941
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,680
He kept seven snuff boxes in here.

942
01:29:01,880 --> 01:29:03,640
l could swear they were all gold.

943
01:29:04,240 --> 01:29:05,480
And now look.

944
01:29:06,200 --> 01:29:07,960
There's only one left.

945
01:29:09,160 --> 01:29:10,360
Where does he work?

946
01:29:58,720 --> 01:30:02,200
l have just heard some news
that may be of interest to you.

947
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:05,040
What?

948
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:07,360
Mozart is writing a new opera.

949
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:08,920
An italian opera.

950
01:30:10,520 --> 01:30:11,760
Italian?

951
01:30:13,160 --> 01:30:14,360
That's not all.

952
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:17,200
He has chosen for his subject, Figaro.

953
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:19,800
The Marriage of Figaro.

954
01:30:20,840 --> 01:30:24,080
He is setting that play to music?

955
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:25,680
Yes.

956
01:30:27,160 --> 01:30:30,280
What is this Marriage of Figaro?

957
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:33,800
It's a French play, Kappelmeister.

958
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,960
It has been banned by the emperor.

959
01:30:37,240 --> 01:30:39,120
You're absolutely sure?

960
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:47,320
Gentlemen, sit down.

961
01:30:55,960 --> 01:30:59,720
Are you aware that l have declared
the French play of Figaro...

962
01:31:00,040 --> 01:31:01,720
...unsuitable for our theatre?

963
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:04,080
Yes, sire.

964
01:31:05,480 --> 01:31:08,160
Yet we hear you're making
an opera from it.

965
01:31:08,680 --> 01:31:09,880
Is this true?

966
01:31:13,680 --> 01:31:14,800
Who told you?

967
01:31:15,880 --> 01:31:18,560
It is not your place to ask questions.

968
01:31:19,320 --> 01:31:20,360
Is it true?

969
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:21,920
Yes.

970
01:31:23,160 --> 01:31:24,600
l admit it is.

971
01:31:27,320 --> 01:31:28,760
Would you tell me why?

972
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:34,240
Majesty, it is only a comedy.

973
01:31:34,440 --> 01:31:35,640
What you think...

974
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:37,160
...is scarcely the point.

975
01:31:37,360 --> 01:31:39,920
It’s what His Majesty thinks
that counts.

976
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:46,560
l am a tolerant man.

977
01:31:47,680 --> 01:31:49,680
l do not censor things lightly.

978
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:52,200
When l do, l have good reason.

979
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:54,280
Figaro...

980
01:31:54,920 --> 01:31:56,480
...is a bad play.

981
01:31:56,920 --> 01:31:59,400
It stirs up hatred between classes.

982
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:02,200
In France it has caused
nothing but bitterness.

983
01:32:02,640 --> 01:32:05,560
My sister Antoinette writes me
that she is beginning...

984
01:32:05,720 --> 01:32:07,640
...to be frightened of her own people.

985
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:11,480
Sire, l swear to you,
there's nothing like that in the piece.

986
01:32:11,680 --> 01:32:14,000
l took out everything
that could give offense.

987
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:15,400
l hate politics.

988
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:18,840
I’m afraid you're
rather innocent, my friend.

989
01:32:19,160 --> 01:32:20,680
In these dangerous times...

990
01:32:20,840 --> 01:32:24,400
...l cannot afford to provoke
our nobles or our people...

991
01:32:24,640 --> 01:32:26,480
...simply over a theatre piece.

992
01:32:26,920 --> 01:32:29,240
Majesty, this is just a frolic.

993
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:30,800
A piece about love.

994
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:32,400
Love.

995
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:33,560
Again!

996
01:32:34,240 --> 01:32:35,520
And it's new!

997
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:39,400
It’s entirely new. It’s so new
that people will go mad for it.

998
01:32:39,640 --> 01:32:41,400
l have scenes....

999
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:45,040
The end of the second act,
for example....

1000
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:46,680
It’s a simple duet...

1001
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:49,680
...just a husband and a wife quarreling.
Suddenly...

1002
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:53,680
...the wife's scheming little maid
comes in. It’s a very funny situation.

1003
01:32:54,640 --> 01:32:56,280
Duet turns into trio.

1004
01:32:56,680 --> 01:32:59,280
The valet enters.
He's plotting with the maid.

1005
01:32:59,480 --> 01:33:01,280
Trio turns into quartet.

1006
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:02,920
Then a gardener comes in.

1007
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:06,320
Quartet becomes quintet,
and so on and on...

1008
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:08,880
...sextet, septet, octet.

1009
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:11,480
How long do you think
l can sustain that?

1010
01:33:13,680 --> 01:33:15,000
l have no idea.

1011
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:16,240
Guess.

1012
01:33:17,320 --> 01:33:18,800
Guess, Your Majesty.

1013
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:21,760
Imagine the longest
it could be sustained...

1014
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:23,400
...then double it.

1015
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:27,680
6?

1016
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:30,920
7 minutes.

1017
01:33:34,280 --> 01:33:35,240
8 minutes?

1018
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:37,480
20, sire! 20 minutes!

1019
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:42,120
20 minutes of continuous music.
No recitatives!

1020
01:33:44,640 --> 01:33:46,040
Only opera can do this.

1021
01:33:46,240 --> 01:33:48,800
In a play, if more than one person
speaks at once...

1022
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:51,920
...it's just noise.
No one can understand a word.

1023
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:54,560
But with opera, with music....

1024
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:58,400
With music you can have 20 individuals
all talking at the same time.

1025
01:33:58,600 --> 01:34:01,720
And it's not noise.
It’s a perfect harmony!

1026
01:34:03,960 --> 01:34:05,400
Music is not the issue.

1027
01:34:05,720 --> 01:34:09,920
No one doubts your talent. It’s your
literary judgment that's in question.

1028
01:34:10,720 --> 01:34:15,480
Even with the politics taken out of it,
it would still remain a vulgar farce.

1029
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:19,200
Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?

1030
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:20,720
Surely...

1031
01:34:20,920 --> 01:34:23,680
...you can choose more elevated themes.

1032
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:25,960
Elevated!
What does that mean, elevated?

1033
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:28,440
l am fed...

1034
01:34:28,640 --> 01:34:30,120
...to the teeth with these...

1035
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:34,120
...elevated things.
Old dead legends.

1036
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:35,880
Why must we go on forever...

1037
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:38,120
...writing only about gods and legends?

1038
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:39,720
Because they do.

1039
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:43,160
They go on forever.

1040
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:47,040
At least what they represent:
the eternal in us.

1041
01:34:47,960 --> 01:34:50,520
Opera is here to ennoble us, Mozart.

1042
01:34:50,720 --> 01:34:53,760
You and me,
just the same as His Majesty.

1043
01:34:59,480 --> 01:35:01,200
Come on now, be honest!

1044
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:05,200
Who wouldn't rather listen
to a hairdresser than Hercules?

1045
01:35:06,280 --> 01:35:08,040
Or Horatius or Orpheus.

1046
01:35:08,240 --> 01:35:10,440
So lofty, they sound as if
they shit marble!

1047
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:13,520
What!

1048
01:35:14,840 --> 01:35:17,680
Govern your tongue, Mozart,
how dare you!

1049
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:24,960
Forgive me, Majesty.

1050
01:35:26,920 --> 01:35:28,840
I’m a vulgar man.

1051
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:32,520
But, l assure you,
my music is not.

1052
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,360
You are passionate, Mozart...

1053
01:35:40,680 --> 01:35:43,160
...but you do not persuade.

1054
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:48,200
Sire, the whole opera is finished.

1055
01:35:49,400 --> 01:35:51,040
You know how much work l did?

1056
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:54,760
His Majesty has been...

1057
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:57,800
...more than patient.

1058
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:01,720
How can l persuade you
if l can't show it?

1059
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:03,000
That will do.

1060
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:07,800
Let me tell how it begins.

1061
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:10,560
May l just do that?

1062
01:36:10,760 --> 01:36:11,880
Show how it begins?

1063
01:36:18,680 --> 01:36:19,600
Please.

1064
01:36:22,680 --> 01:36:25,880
There's a servant down on his knees.
And do you know why?

1065
01:36:26,200 --> 01:36:29,360
Not from any oppression, no.
Because he's measuring a space.

1066
01:36:29,680 --> 01:36:31,320
Do you know what for?

1067
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:32,840
His bed.

1068
01:36:33,080 --> 01:36:34,360
His wedding bed.

1069
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:36,120
To see if it will fit!

1070
01:36:45,640 --> 01:36:46,640
Late!

1071
01:36:50,360 --> 01:36:51,960
On the beat.

1072
01:36:52,120 --> 01:36:53,200
Good!

1073
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:56,800
Yes!

1074
01:37:03,240 --> 01:37:04,240
Early!

1075
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:12,600
Mozart is already rehearsing.

1076
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:20,560
In that case, gentlemen, l think...

1077
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:26,440
...we should help him all we can.

1078
01:37:31,120 --> 01:37:34,080
And do our best to protect him
against the emperor's anger.

1079
01:37:34,240 --> 01:37:35,360
What anger?

1080
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:37,440
About the ballet.

1081
01:37:38,920 --> 01:37:40,840
What ballet?

1082
01:37:41,680 --> 01:37:43,520
Excuse me...

1083
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,960
...but didn't
His Majesty specifically...

1084
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:49,120
...forbid the ballet at his opera?

1085
01:38:26,680 --> 01:38:27,720
A word with you.

1086
01:38:28,520 --> 01:38:30,120
Certainly, Herr Direktor.

1087
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:32,160
Now, Herr Mozart!

1088
01:38:33,320 --> 01:38:34,960
Five minutes, please.

1089
01:38:39,120 --> 01:38:43,880
Do you not know that His Majesty has
expressly forbidden ballet in operas?

1090
01:38:44,760 --> 01:38:47,160
It’s not a ballet, it's a dance
at Figaro's wedding.

1091
01:38:47,360 --> 01:38:49,720
Exactly. A dance.

1092
01:38:49,880 --> 01:38:53,200
Surely, His Majesty didn't mean
no dancing when it's in the story.

1093
01:38:54,480 --> 01:38:58,320
It is dangerous to interpret his edicts.
Give me your score, please.

1094
01:39:08,360 --> 01:39:09,880
Thank you.

1095
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:14,160
What are you doing?

1096
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:16,160
What are you doing?

1097
01:39:16,360 --> 01:39:18,760
Taking out what you should
never have put in.

1098
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:23,560
Please.

1099
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:25,440
l have no one else to turn to.

1100
01:39:25,640 --> 01:39:26,600
What is it?

1101
01:39:27,160 --> 01:39:28,560
It’s unbelievable.

1102
01:39:29,160 --> 01:39:32,800
The Direktor has actually torn up
a huge section of my music.

1103
01:39:33,160 --> 01:39:35,600
They say l have to rewrite the opera.

1104
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:38,880
But it's perfect as it is.

1105
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:40,640
l can't...

1106
01:39:40,840 --> 01:39:43,040
...rewrite what's perfect.

1107
01:39:45,040 --> 01:39:46,320
Please.

1108
01:39:46,520 --> 01:39:47,960
Can't you talk to him?

1109
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:53,440
Why bother with Rosenberg?
He's no friend of yours.

1110
01:39:53,640 --> 01:39:55,960
l could kill him.
l mean, really! Kill him!

1111
01:39:59,080 --> 01:40:02,440
l threw the entire score into the fire,
he made me so angry.

1112
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:04,320
You burned the score?

1113
01:40:05,640 --> 01:40:08,040
No, my wife took it out in time.

1114
01:40:10,040 --> 01:40:11,240
Thank God.

1115
01:40:12,920 --> 01:40:15,920
It’s unfair that a man like that
should have power over our work.

1116
01:40:19,040 --> 01:40:20,720
But others have power over him.

1117
01:40:23,920 --> 01:40:26,120
l think I'll take this up
with the emperor.

1118
01:40:28,920 --> 01:40:30,240
Excellency...

1119
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:31,720
...would you?

1120
01:40:33,400 --> 01:40:35,320
With all my heart, Mozart.

1121
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:38,400
Thank you.

1122
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:43,720
Please, Herr Mozart.
Please, it's not a holy relic.

1123
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:50,320
l don't need to tell you
l said nothing whatever to the emperor.

1124
01:40:51,200 --> 01:40:54,240
l went to the theatre to tell
Mozart something, anything...

1125
01:40:57,240 --> 01:40:58,720
...when suddenly...

1126
01:40:59,960 --> 01:41:01,920
...in the middle of the third act...

1127
01:41:02,680 --> 01:41:05,160
...to my astonishment,
the emperor...

1128
01:41:05,360 --> 01:41:07,680
...who never attended rehearsals...

1129
01:41:07,880 --> 01:41:09,040
...suddenly appeared.

1130
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:28,600
What is this?

1131
01:41:32,160 --> 01:41:33,720
l don't understand.

1132
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:36,320
Is it modern?

1133
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:40,640
The Herr Direktor...

1134
01:41:40,840 --> 01:41:43,840
...he has removed un balletto...

1135
01:41:44,040 --> 01:41:47,480
...that would have occurred
at this place.

1136
01:41:49,360 --> 01:41:50,440
Why?

1137
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:52,040
It’s your regulation.

1138
01:41:53,040 --> 01:41:54,600
No ballet in your opera.

1139
01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:06,360
Do you like this?

1140
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:10,960
It’s not a question of liking.

1141
01:42:12,920 --> 01:42:15,240
Your own law decrees it, I’m afraid.

1142
01:42:17,080 --> 01:42:18,080
Look at them!

1143
01:42:22,600 --> 01:42:24,320
This is nonsense!

1144
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:27,360
Let me see the scene with the music.

1145
01:42:28,680 --> 01:42:30,080
Oblige me!

1146
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:44,040
Can we see the scene
with the music back, please?

1147
01:42:44,240 --> 01:42:45,160
Certainly!

1148
01:42:45,400 --> 01:42:47,120
Certainly, Herr Direktor.

1149
01:42:53,200 --> 01:42:55,600
Bring the palace set back in, please.

1150
01:43:31,960 --> 01:43:33,720
The restored third act...

1151
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:36,080
...was bold, brilliant.

1152
01:43:37,080 --> 01:43:38,480
The fourth...

1153
01:43:41,240 --> 01:43:42,960
...was astounding.

1154
01:43:51,480 --> 01:43:52,560
l saw a woman...

1155
01:43:52,720 --> 01:43:55,320
...disguised in her maid's clothes...

1156
01:43:55,960 --> 01:44:00,720
...hear her husband speak the first
tender words he'd offered her in years.

1157
01:44:01,720 --> 01:44:04,360
Simply because he thinks
she is someone else.

1158
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:11,640
l heard the music of true forgiveness
filling the theatre...

1159
01:44:12,440 --> 01:44:16,720
...conferring on all who sat there
perfect absolution.

1160
01:44:17,400 --> 01:44:20,440
God was singing
through this little man...

1161
01:44:20,680 --> 01:44:22,680
...to all the world.

1162
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:25,200
Unstoppable.

1163
01:44:25,840 --> 01:44:30,600
Making my defeat more bitter
with every passing bar.

1164
01:45:07,560 --> 01:45:10,240
And then...
do you know what happened?

1165
01:45:13,440 --> 01:45:14,800
A miracle!

1166
01:45:21,760 --> 01:45:22,920
With that yawn...

1167
01:45:23,280 --> 01:45:25,120
...l saw my defeat turn...

1168
01:45:25,280 --> 01:45:26,960
...into a victory.

1169
01:45:31,280 --> 01:45:33,400
Mozart was lucky
The emperor yawned only once.

1170
01:45:34,640 --> 01:45:36,040
Three yawns...

1171
01:45:37,160 --> 01:45:40,480
...and the opera would fail
the same night. Two yawns...

1172
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:43,720
...within a week at most.
With one yawn...

1173
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:47,040
...the composer could still get...

1174
01:45:49,200 --> 01:45:52,440
...nine performances! Nine,
that's all it's had...and withdrawn.

1175
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
l know, l know.

1176
01:45:56,400 --> 01:45:58,120
It’s outrageous.

1177
01:45:59,720 --> 01:46:03,280
Still, if the public
doesn't like one's work...

1178
01:46:03,680 --> 01:46:06,120
...one has to accept
the fact gracefully.

1179
01:46:06,280 --> 01:46:08,040
But what is it they don't like?

1180
01:46:09,880 --> 01:46:14,200
l can speak for the emperor. You make
too many demands on the royal ear.

1181
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:17,560
He can't concentrate
over an hour.

1182
01:46:17,920 --> 01:46:19,280
You gave him four.

1183
01:46:25,680 --> 01:46:26,880
What did you think of it?

1184
01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:30,280
Did you like it at all?

1185
01:46:32,360 --> 01:46:33,760
l thought it was marvelous.

1186
01:46:35,280 --> 01:46:36,680
Of course.

1187
01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:38,640
It’s the best opera yet written!

1188
01:46:39,120 --> 01:46:40,400
l know it.

1189
01:46:43,480 --> 01:46:44,960
Why didn't they come?

1190
01:46:47,880 --> 01:46:51,120
l think you overestimate
our dear Viennese, my friend.

1191
01:46:51,400 --> 01:46:54,560
You didn't even give them
a good bang at the end of songs...

1192
01:46:54,800 --> 01:46:56,160
...to tell them when to clap.

1193
01:46:58,040 --> 01:46:59,480
l know.

1194
01:47:00,640 --> 01:47:02,520
You should give me lessons in that.

1195
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:06,240
l wouldn't presume.

1196
01:47:10,440 --> 01:47:13,120
Nevertheless, at the risk of imposing...

1197
01:47:13,480 --> 01:47:15,400
...I'd like you to see my new piece.

1198
01:47:17,560 --> 01:47:19,560
It would be a tremendous honor for me.

1199
01:47:20,040 --> 01:47:22,440
No, the honor would be all mine.

1200
01:48:45,200 --> 01:48:46,640
l believe...

1201
01:48:48,240 --> 01:48:49,720
...l believe...

1202
01:48:49,960 --> 01:48:52,280
...it is the best opera...

1203
01:48:52,480 --> 01:48:53,800
...yet written, my friends.

1204
01:48:58,800 --> 01:49:00,480
You are the brightest star...

1205
01:49:00,680 --> 01:49:02,400
...in the musical firmament.

1206
01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:04,000
You do honor to Vienna...

1207
01:49:04,680 --> 01:49:06,040
...and to me.

1208
01:49:33,840 --> 01:49:35,240
It was good of you to come.

1209
01:49:35,840 --> 01:49:36,960
How could l not?

1210
01:49:37,280 --> 01:49:38,360
Bravo, maestro.

1211
01:49:40,360 --> 01:49:41,880
Did my work please you?

1212
01:49:44,360 --> 01:49:47,800
l never knew that
music like that was possible.

1213
01:49:49,160 --> 01:49:50,440
You flatter me.

1214
01:49:52,720 --> 01:49:54,760
One hears such sounds...

1215
01:49:55,120 --> 01:49:57,320
...and what can one say but...

1216
01:49:57,520 --> 01:49:58,440
...Salieri!

1217
01:50:05,560 --> 01:50:08,280
Everybody's here and we've got guests.

1218
01:50:09,040 --> 01:50:10,880
I've got some more.

1219
01:50:11,080 --> 01:50:13,280
You remember
my good friend Schikaneder.

1220
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:14,720
Come in!

1221
01:50:14,920 --> 01:50:18,040
Don't be shy. This is...

1222
01:50:18,200 --> 01:50:20,360
...a very nice girl, and this is too....

1223
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:23,280
Yes, my love?

1224
01:50:23,880 --> 01:50:25,880
These gentlemen are from Salzburg.

1225
01:50:29,040 --> 01:50:31,080
We were just talking about Salzburg.

1226
01:50:33,200 --> 01:50:35,360
Your father is dead.

1227
01:50:57,160 --> 01:50:58,360
So rose...

1228
01:50:58,640 --> 01:51:01,640
...the dreadful ghost,
from his next...

1229
01:51:01,880 --> 01:51:03,920
...and blackest opera.

1230
01:51:09,440 --> 01:51:13,480
There, on the stage,
stood the figure of a dead commander.

1231
01:51:13,680 --> 01:51:14,960
And l knew...

1232
01:51:15,360 --> 01:51:17,080
...only l understood...

1233
01:51:17,400 --> 01:51:19,960
...that the horrifying apparition
was Leopold...

1234
01:51:20,720 --> 01:51:22,240
...raised from the dead!

1235
01:51:50,560 --> 01:51:53,000
Wolfgang had summoned up
his own father...

1236
01:51:54,280 --> 01:51:58,160
...to accuse his son
before all the world!

1237
01:51:59,440 --> 01:52:01,120
It was...

1238
01:52:01,560 --> 01:52:03,960
...terrifying and wonderful to watch.

1239
01:53:06,360 --> 01:53:07,800
And now...

1240
01:53:13,040 --> 01:53:15,360
...the madness began in me.

1241
01:53:18,160 --> 01:53:20,280
The madness of a man
splitting in half.

1242
01:53:25,080 --> 01:53:27,480
Through my influence, l saw to it...

1243
01:53:28,280 --> 01:53:30,840
...Don Giovanni was played
only five times in Vienna.

1244
01:53:31,280 --> 01:53:34,360
But, in secret,
l went to every one of those five.

1245
01:53:36,320 --> 01:53:38,160
Worshipping sound...

1246
01:53:38,360 --> 01:53:41,120
...l alone seemed to hear.

1247
01:54:26,080 --> 01:54:28,160
As l stood there, understanding...

1248
01:54:29,280 --> 01:54:32,320
...how that bitter old man
still possessed his poor son...

1249
01:54:32,960 --> 01:54:35,280
...even from beyond the grave...

1250
01:54:35,720 --> 01:54:37,600
...l began to see a way...

1251
01:54:37,800 --> 01:54:39,560
...a terrible way...

1252
01:54:39,760 --> 01:54:41,840
...l could finally triumph...

1253
01:54:42,760 --> 01:54:44,480
...over God.

1254
01:57:51,680 --> 01:57:53,960
l have come to commission
work from you.

1255
01:57:55,560 --> 01:57:56,520
What work?

1256
01:57:58,320 --> 01:58:00,040
A mass for the dead.

1257
01:58:00,440 --> 01:58:01,640
What dead?

1258
01:58:02,440 --> 01:58:03,320
Who's dead?

1259
01:58:04,920 --> 01:58:06,640
A man who deserved
a requiem mass...

1260
01:58:07,440 --> 01:58:09,000
...and never got one.

1261
01:58:09,480 --> 01:58:10,360
Who are you?

1262
01:58:10,960 --> 01:58:12,680
l am only a messenger.

1263
01:58:12,840 --> 01:58:13,800
Do you accept?

1264
01:58:15,640 --> 01:58:16,680
You'll be well paid.

1265
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:26,640
Do you accept?

1266
01:58:37,640 --> 01:58:38,920
Work fast.

1267
01:58:39,120 --> 01:58:41,520
And be sure to tell no one
what you do.

1268
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:43,760
You will see me again soon.

1269
01:59:31,320 --> 01:59:33,600
My plan was so simple...

1270
01:59:35,200 --> 01:59:37,000
...that it terrified me.

1271
01:59:39,600 --> 01:59:42,760
First, l must get the death mass,
and then...

1272
01:59:45,240 --> 01:59:46,760
...l must achieve his death.

1273
01:59:49,440 --> 01:59:50,160
What?

1274
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:53,960
His funeral!

1275
01:59:55,080 --> 01:59:57,600
Imagine it! The cathedral...

1276
01:59:57,800 --> 02:00:00,640
...all Vienna sitting there.
His coffin...

1277
02:00:00,800 --> 02:00:04,320
...Mozart's little coffin in the middle.

1278
02:00:05,240 --> 02:00:06,800
And then...

1279
02:00:07,360 --> 02:00:09,360
...in that silence...

1280
02:00:11,720 --> 02:00:13,280
...music!

1281
02:00:14,840 --> 02:00:19,600
A divine music bursts out
over them all.

1282
02:00:20,680 --> 02:00:24,000
A great mass of death.

1283
02:00:25,560 --> 02:00:29,040
Requiem mass for Wolfgang Mozart.

1284
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:33,120
Composed by his devoted friend...

1285
02:00:33,920 --> 02:00:36,320
...Antonio Salieri.

1286
02:00:37,920 --> 02:00:39,680
What sublimity!

1287
02:00:40,600 --> 02:00:41,840
What depth!

1288
02:00:42,080 --> 02:00:44,480
What passion in the music!

1289
02:00:45,680 --> 02:00:49,200
Salieri has been
touched by God at last...

1290
02:00:49,360 --> 02:00:52,040
...and God forced to listen.

1291
02:00:53,600 --> 02:00:56,720
Powerless to stop it!

1292
02:00:57,200 --> 02:00:59,480
l, for once, in the end,
laughing at Him!

1293
02:01:07,640 --> 02:01:09,320
The only thing that worried me...

1294
02:01:09,520 --> 02:01:11,240
...was the actual killing.

1295
02:01:11,840 --> 02:01:13,440
How does one do that?

1296
02:01:14,960 --> 02:01:16,960
How does one kill a man?

1297
02:01:18,240 --> 02:01:20,600
It’s one thing...

1298
02:01:20,760 --> 02:01:22,600
...to dream about it.

1299
02:01:23,320 --> 02:01:25,720
Very different when you...

1300
02:01:28,720 --> 02:01:30,520
...when you have to do it...

1301
02:01:33,360 --> 02:01:35,440
...with your own hands.

1302
02:01:45,960 --> 02:01:47,440
Come in!

1303
02:02:02,360 --> 02:02:05,560
I’ve come to dinner.

1304
02:02:07,320 --> 02:02:09,680
Dinner! Are you mad?
I’m a nobleman.

1305
02:02:09,920 --> 02:02:12,560
l only ever dine
with people of my own height.

1306
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:14,560
Stop it!

1307
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:17,840
Be careful! Be careful!

1308
02:02:18,080 --> 02:02:19,840
Hold tight!

1309
02:02:21,320 --> 02:02:24,040
I’m a famous...

1310
02:02:24,320 --> 02:02:26,240
...horseman

1311
02:02:28,320 --> 02:02:30,640
And we're a famous horsie

1312
02:02:32,800 --> 02:02:36,120
Give me a hoof my darling

1313
02:02:36,760 --> 02:02:40,040
And I’ll give you my heart

1314
02:02:43,760 --> 02:02:46,120
Take me to your stable

1315
02:02:46,320 --> 02:02:48,640
And never more we'll part

1316
02:02:56,360 --> 02:02:57,120
Kill me!

1317
02:02:59,320 --> 02:03:00,120
Kill me!

1318
02:03:19,600 --> 02:03:22,360
We're going to make a soprano stew

1319
02:03:29,800 --> 02:03:31,440
And when you make a soprano stew

1320
02:03:32,680 --> 02:03:34,120
Shut up!

1321
02:03:35,120 --> 02:03:37,520
I’m sick to death of that tune!

1322
02:03:55,800 --> 02:03:57,360
Give him some hay, my darling

1323
02:04:00,040 --> 02:04:01,480
And I’ll give you my heart

1324
02:04:03,120 --> 02:04:05,120
Leporello! Some hay!

1325
02:04:53,320 --> 02:04:56,080
We hope
You're contented

1326
02:05:03,120 --> 02:05:06,640
With what
We've presented

1327
02:05:09,840 --> 02:05:13,560
And love our dove of peace

1328
02:05:39,360 --> 02:05:40,600
What did you think?

1329
02:05:40,800 --> 02:05:42,000
Wonderful!

1330
02:05:42,160 --> 02:05:43,520
He liked the little people.

1331
02:05:44,680 --> 02:05:46,360
It’s all in good fun.

1332
02:05:47,600 --> 02:05:48,840
l liked the horse.

1333
02:06:00,280 --> 02:06:03,640
l tell you, if you played
Don Giovanni here...

1334
02:06:04,160 --> 02:06:06,920
...you would have had
a wonderful success.

1335
02:06:07,120 --> 02:06:09,040
You belong here!

1336
02:06:09,240 --> 02:06:12,800
Not at the snobby court.
You could do anything you like.

1337
02:06:13,040 --> 02:06:17,120
The more fantastic, the better.
That's what people want: fantasy!

1338
02:06:17,960 --> 02:06:22,240
You write a proper part for me
and a couple of catchy songs...

1339
02:06:23,640 --> 02:06:27,680
...l guarantee you a triumph deluxe!

1340
02:06:28,600 --> 02:06:31,120
-What do you say?
-How much will you pay him?

1341
02:06:35,600 --> 02:06:37,640
l see you brought
your manager with you.

1342
02:06:39,840 --> 02:06:41,160
Well, madame...

1343
02:06:41,800 --> 02:06:43,040
...how about...

1344
02:06:43,480 --> 02:06:44,800
...half the receipts?

1345
02:06:45,320 --> 02:06:46,760
Half the receipts!

1346
02:06:47,800 --> 02:06:49,520
I’m talking about now.

1347
02:06:49,680 --> 02:06:51,360
How much will you pay him now?

1348
02:06:51,640 --> 02:06:52,760
Down payment.

1349
02:06:52,960 --> 02:06:54,880
Down payment?

1350
02:06:55,960 --> 02:06:58,640
Who do you think l am, the emperor?

1351
02:06:59,120 --> 02:07:01,000
l have to go.

1352
02:07:01,560 --> 02:07:03,000
Stay, you'll enjoy this.

1353
02:07:06,680 --> 02:07:07,640
You won't do this.

1354
02:07:07,880 --> 02:07:09,600
-Why not? Half the house!
-When?

1355
02:07:09,920 --> 02:07:13,360
We need money now! Either he
pays you now, or you don't do it.

1356
02:07:14,560 --> 02:07:16,120
l don't trust that man.

1357
02:07:16,320 --> 02:07:19,240
And l don't like what he did
with your opera. It was common.

1358
02:07:19,440 --> 02:07:20,640
You liked it.

1359
02:07:21,080 --> 02:07:22,760
Monkey, punky, flunky!

1360
02:07:23,040 --> 02:07:26,120
Half the house!
You'll never see a penny.

1361
02:07:26,360 --> 02:07:28,240
l want it here in my hand.

1362
02:07:28,440 --> 02:07:31,040
I’ll put it here in your hand.

1363
02:07:32,480 --> 02:07:36,000
You won't put a thing in my hand
until l see some money!

1364
02:07:37,400 --> 02:07:41,760
It's embarrassing . Can't you think of
anyone who can do something for him?

1365
02:07:42,400 --> 02:07:45,120
I' m afraid Mozart
is a lost cause, baron.

1366
02:07:46,840 --> 02:07:49,880
He has succeeded in alienating
practically the whole of Vienna.

1367
02:07:50,920 --> 02:07:52,640
He never pays his debts.

1368
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:55,760
l can 't think of anyone
to whom I’d dare recommend him.

1369
02:07:56,560 --> 02:07:59,600
Herr Mozart. What a surprise!

1370
02:08:01,400 --> 02:08:02,880
What can I do for you?

1371
02:08:05,440 --> 02:08:08,680
Is my pupil still interested
in learning the art of music?

1372
02:08:11,640 --> 02:08:14,600
Your pupil is married
and living in Mannheim, young man.

1373
02:08:16,160 --> 02:08:17,400
Really?

1374
02:08:23,320 --> 02:08:28,800
Perhaps your dear wife might care
to profit from my instruction.

1375
02:08:29,280 --> 02:08:30,440
What is it, Mozart?

1376
02:08:31,920 --> 02:08:33,120
What's the matter with you?

1377
02:08:34,160 --> 02:08:35,120
Well . . .

1378
02:08:35,600 --> 02:08:38,600
. . .since it appears no one
is eager to hire my services. . .

1379
02:08:40,080 --> 02:08:43,240
. . .could you favor me
with a little money instead?

1380
02:08:47,360 --> 02:08:48,800
What for?

1381
02:08:50,600 --> 02:08:52,560
If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.

1382
02:08:57,600 --> 02:08:59,520
That's hardly the way to go about it.

1383
02:09:00,640 --> 02:09:04,400
You are right, sir. You are right.

1384
02:09:04,600 --> 02:09:07,960
But you see, I am endowed
with talent, and you with money.

1385
02:09:08,240 --> 02:09:10,440
If I offer mine. . .

1386
02:09:11,040 --> 02:09:13,000
. . .you should offer yours.

1387
02:09:16,640 --> 02:09:18,680
I'm sorry, no.

1388
02:09:20,840 --> 02:09:22,120
Please.

1389
02:09:24,640 --> 02:09:26,440
My answer is no, Mozart.

1390
02:09:33,040 --> 02:09:34,000
Please.

1391
02:09:39,280 --> 02:09:40,680
Please!

1392
02:10:17,360 --> 02:10:18,600
Don't answer it.

1393
02:10:21,040 --> 02:10:21,640
Why?

1394
02:10:27,680 --> 02:10:29,400
Tell him I'm not here.

1395
02:10:32,960 --> 02:10:34,680
Tell him I'm working on it.

1396
02:10:36,320 --> 02:10:37,600
Come back later.

1397
02:10:53,640 --> 02:10:55,520
Am I interrupting something?

1398
02:10:55,760 --> 02:10:57,760
-No.
-Good.

1399
02:10:58,120 --> 02:10:59,360
Where's our friend?

1400
02:10:59,560 --> 02:11:00,960
He's not here.

1401
02:11:01,920 --> 02:11:03,640
But he said he's working on it.

1402
02:11:06,040 --> 02:11:06,920
Is that it?

1403
02:11:13,640 --> 02:11:14,920
Is he happy with it?

1404
02:11:18,800 --> 02:11:19,640
What's this?

1405
02:11:20,160 --> 02:11:21,960
A requiem mass?

1406
02:11:22,320 --> 02:11:24,160
You think I'm in the funeral business?

1407
02:11:24,640 --> 02:11:26,120
Put it down! Put it down!

1408
02:11:26,320 --> 02:11:28,040
Put it down,
it's nothing for you!

1409
02:11:28,240 --> 02:11:29,280
I'm sorry.

1410
02:11:31,320 --> 02:11:32,840
What have you got for me?

1411
02:11:33,640 --> 02:11:34,800
Finished?

1412
02:11:36,560 --> 02:11:37,120
What?

1413
02:11:37,720 --> 02:11:40,440
The vaudeville, what do you think?

1414
02:11:41,560 --> 02:11:42,160
Yes.

1415
02:11:43,400 --> 02:11:44,640
Can I see it?

1416
02:11:44,920 --> 02:11:45,600
No.

1417
02:11:46,880 --> 02:11:47,680
Why not?

1418
02:11:48,760 --> 02:11:50,640
Because there's nothing to see.

1419
02:12:01,800 --> 02:12:06,400
I asked you if we could start
rehearsals next week and you said yes.

1420
02:12:08,360 --> 02:12:09,120
We can.

1421
02:12:09,320 --> 02:12:11,400
So let me see it.
Where is it?

1422
02:12:13,640 --> 02:12:14,720
Here.

1423
02:12:16,240 --> 02:12:18,120
It's all right here in my noodle.

1424
02:12:18,760 --> 02:12:21,080
The rest is just scribbling.

1425
02:12:21,960 --> 02:12:24,360
Scribbling and bibbling,
bibbling and scribbling.

1426
02:12:28,400 --> 02:12:29,520
Want a drink?

1427
02:12:30,800 --> 02:12:33,040
Do you know how many people
I've hired for you?

1428
02:12:33,280 --> 02:12:34,240
Leave him alone!

1429
02:12:34,440 --> 02:12:35,880
I'm paying these people!

1430
02:12:36,080 --> 02:12:37,360
He's doing his best.

1431
02:12:37,640 --> 02:12:40,200
I'm paying them to wait for you.
It's ridiculous!

1432
02:12:40,400 --> 02:12:43,240
You know what's ridiculous?
Your libretto's ridiculous!

1433
02:12:44,360 --> 02:12:46,640
Only an idiot would ask Wolfie
to work on that!

1434
02:12:47,400 --> 02:12:49,800
12-foot snakes, magic flutes?

1435
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:51,880
What's so intelligent about a requiem?

1436
02:12:52,600 --> 02:12:53,680
Money.

1437
02:12:58,480 --> 02:12:59,800
You're mad.

1438
02:13:00,920 --> 02:13:02,280
She's mad.

1439
02:13:03,960 --> 02:13:05,880
Wolfie, write it down.

1440
02:13:06,720 --> 02:13:08,480
Just write it down.

1441
02:13:08,960 --> 02:13:10,320
On paper.

1442
02:13:11,120 --> 02:13:13,600
It's no use to anybody in your head.

1443
02:13:14,240 --> 02:13:16,440
To hell with your death mass!

1444
02:13:18,560 --> 02:13:21,400
Calm yourself.
What's the matter with you?

1445
02:13:21,600 --> 02:13:23,400
I'm not working there anymore.

1446
02:13:23,760 --> 02:13:24,720
What has happened?

1447
02:13:25,960 --> 02:13:28,040
You don't know what it's like.

1448
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:31,440
Herr Mozart frightens me.

1449
02:13:32,080 --> 02:13:34,080
He drinks all day...

1450
02:13:34,280 --> 02:13:37,000
...then takes all that medicine
and it makes him worse.

1451
02:13:37,800 --> 02:13:39,240
Is he working?

1452
02:13:41,160 --> 02:13:43,960
I'm frightened, sir, really!

1453
02:13:44,240 --> 02:13:46,160
When he speaks he makes no sense.

1454
02:13:46,360 --> 02:13:47,760
Is he working?

1455
02:13:50,600 --> 02:13:52,480
I suppose so.

1456
02:13:53,320 --> 02:13:56,040
He sits there all the time,
doing some silly opera.

1457
02:13:58,800 --> 02:14:00,880
Please, don't ask me to go back again.

1458
02:14:01,240 --> 02:14:03,760
I'm frightened.
I'm very, very frightened!

1459
02:14:04,240 --> 02:14:06,000
Are you sure it's an opera?

1460
02:15:47,200 --> 02:15:48,600
I don't have it yet.

1461
02:15:49,960 --> 02:15:51,680
Are you neglecting my request?

1462
02:15:56,200 --> 02:15:57,440
I promise you.

1463
02:15:58,600 --> 02:16:00,600
I'll give you the best piece I ever--

1464
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:07,280
This is my wife.

1465
02:16:09,840 --> 02:16:12,800
I've been sick but I'm
all right now, aren't I?

1466
02:16:13,200 --> 02:16:14,920
Yes, sir.
He's all right.

1467
02:16:15,440 --> 02:16:17,760
And he's working on it very hard.

1468
02:16:19,600 --> 02:16:20,760
Two more weeks.

1469
02:16:21,800 --> 02:16:22,920
Please.

1470
02:16:23,560 --> 02:16:28,360
The sooner you finish,
the greater your reward. Work!

1471
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:43,680
I think you really are going mad.

1472
02:16:46,760 --> 02:16:50,680
You work like a slave for that idiot
actor who won't give you a penny!

1473
02:16:50,880 --> 02:16:51,960
And here....

1474
02:16:52,160 --> 02:16:53,880
This is not a ghost!

1475
02:16:54,080 --> 02:16:57,200
This is a real man
who puts down real money.

1476
02:16:59,680 --> 02:17:02,680
Why on earth won't you finish it?

1477
02:17:03,560 --> 02:17:06,840
Can you give me one reason
I can understand?

1478
02:17:08,920 --> 02:17:09,960
It's killing me.

1479
02:17:14,920 --> 02:17:16,640
You're drunk, aren't you?

1480
02:17:17,680 --> 02:17:20,280
Be honest, tell me.
You've been drinking.

1481
02:17:22,840 --> 02:17:24,680
It's not fair.

1482
02:17:25,160 --> 02:17:27,520
I worry about you all the time.

1483
02:17:27,920 --> 02:17:30,120
I do everything I can to help you.

1484
02:17:31,520 --> 02:17:35,640
And all you do is drink
and talk nonsense, and frighten me.

1485
02:17:35,920 --> 02:17:36,840
Go to bed!

1486
02:17:47,160 --> 02:17:48,200
Please.

1487
02:17:51,440 --> 02:17:53,200
Let me sit here.

1488
02:17:56,280 --> 02:17:58,320
Let me stay here with you.

1489
02:20:25,720 --> 02:20:28,480
I did it!
And I was proud to do it.

1490
02:20:28,680 --> 02:20:30,000
Leave, I said!
Right away!

1491
02:20:30,200 --> 02:20:33,360
And take the child with you!
Here's the money! Go to the spa...

1492
02:20:33,560 --> 02:20:34,960
...and get your health back.

1493
02:20:35,200 --> 02:20:36,920
I was shocked...

1494
02:20:37,120 --> 02:20:39,600
...shocked to my foundation
when I saw her.

1495
02:20:39,800 --> 02:20:42,400
I couldn't believe my eyes,
poor little thing.

1496
02:20:43,040 --> 02:20:46,520
You monster!
No one exists but you, do they?

1497
02:20:46,720 --> 02:20:48,440
You and your music.

1498
02:20:48,640 --> 02:20:49,960
I warned her.

1499
02:20:50,280 --> 02:20:52,520
''Choose a man, not a baby,'' I said.

1500
02:20:52,720 --> 02:20:55,480
You marry him,
you won't have a pot to piss in.

1501
02:20:55,680 --> 02:20:57,680
You selfish thing!

1502
02:20:57,880 --> 02:20:59,760
Selfish, that's what you are.
Selfish.

1503
02:20:59,960 --> 02:21:02,160
Simply selfish!
Do you hear me?

1504
02:24:36,640 --> 02:24:37,760
Pick him up.

1505
02:24:42,200 --> 02:24:43,880
Be careful!
Come with me!

1506
02:24:44,200 --> 02:24:45,640
You! Follow me.

1507
02:25:12,120 --> 02:25:12,960
Is it over?

1508
02:25:13,280 --> 02:25:14,960
Yes, it's over.
It's over.

1509
02:25:17,480 --> 02:25:18,600
Go!

1510
02:25:58,760 --> 02:25:59,560
Go!

1511
02:26:31,120 --> 02:26:32,600
Where is your wife?

1512
02:26:35,960 --> 02:26:37,200
Where is your wife?

1513
02:26:40,600 --> 02:26:44,080
She's not well either.
She went to the spa.

1514
02:26:45,800 --> 02:26:49,080
You are so good to me.
Truly.

1515
02:26:50,120 --> 02:26:51,400
Thank you.

1516
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:53,160
Please!

1517
02:26:54,280 --> 02:26:57,040
No, I mean, to come to my opera.

1518
02:27:00,720 --> 02:27:03,280
You are the only colleague
of mine who came.

1519
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:11,560
I would never miss anything
you had written.

1520
02:27:12,720 --> 02:27:14,680
It's just a vaudeville.

1521
02:27:16,680 --> 02:27:18,440
It's a sublime piece.

1522
02:27:19,720 --> 02:27:21,680
The grandest operone!

1523
02:27:30,480 --> 02:27:32,000
I tell you...

1524
02:27:32,840 --> 02:27:35,560
...you are the greatest
composer known to me.

1525
02:27:40,560 --> 02:27:41,560
Do you mean it?

1526
02:27:47,120 --> 02:27:47,920
It's him!

1527
02:27:49,800 --> 02:27:50,640
The man.

1528
02:27:51,640 --> 02:27:52,440
He's here.

1529
02:27:56,560 --> 02:27:58,440
Tell him to go away.

1530
02:27:58,640 --> 02:28:02,200
Tell him I'm still working on it.
Don't let him in.

1531
02:28:04,480 --> 02:28:05,480
Wait!

1532
02:28:05,880 --> 02:28:09,520
Ask him if he would
give me some money now.

1533
02:28:09,960 --> 02:28:11,640
Tell him it will help me finish.

1534
02:28:35,720 --> 02:28:37,680
-Can we come in?
-Better not.

1535
02:28:38,360 --> 02:28:39,320
He's sleeping.

1536
02:28:40,240 --> 02:28:41,200
He's all right?

1537
02:28:41,520 --> 02:28:43,720
Yes, he's just exhausted.

1538
02:28:43,920 --> 02:28:45,440
He became dizzy.

1539
02:28:45,720 --> 02:28:46,920
That's all.

1540
02:28:47,440 --> 02:28:49,640
Tell him we came by, won't you?

1541
02:28:50,160 --> 02:28:51,480
Of course.

1542
02:28:51,920 --> 02:28:53,480
Give him this.

1543
02:28:53,960 --> 02:28:55,040
That's his share.

1544
02:28:56,040 --> 02:28:58,520
-That should cheer him up.
-Indeed!

1545
02:28:58,720 --> 02:29:01,440
And now good night to you all.
It was...

1546
02:29:02,880 --> 02:29:04,080
...perfection. Truly!

1547
02:29:04,280 --> 02:29:05,760
Thank you.

1548
02:29:15,840 --> 02:29:17,280
What happened?

1549
02:29:25,720 --> 02:29:27,040
He said to give you this.

1550
02:29:28,920 --> 02:29:30,680
And if you finish by tomorrow...

1551
02:29:32,960 --> 02:29:34,520
...he'll pay 100 ducats more.

1552
02:29:38,920 --> 02:29:40,480
That's too soon!

1553
02:29:40,680 --> 02:29:41,760
Tomorrow night....

1554
02:29:43,400 --> 02:29:44,840
It's impossible!

1555
02:29:48,480 --> 02:29:49,800
Did he say 100?

1556
02:29:56,880 --> 02:29:58,360
It's too soon!

1557
02:30:03,120 --> 02:30:04,560
Could I help you?

1558
02:30:07,680 --> 02:30:09,040
Would you?

1559
02:30:13,040 --> 02:30:14,360
Actually, you could.

1560
02:30:21,520 --> 02:30:23,600
-I want to go!
-Where?

1561
02:30:24,440 --> 02:30:25,720
Back to Vienna.

1562
02:30:26,200 --> 02:30:27,320
Now?

1563
02:30:27,600 --> 02:30:29,160
-Yes.
-Why?

1564
02:30:31,560 --> 02:30:32,920
I feel wrong.

1565
02:30:34,240 --> 02:30:36,600
I feel wrong being here.

1566
02:30:39,720 --> 02:30:41,240
Where did I stop?

1567
02:30:41,440 --> 02:30:43,280
The end of the Recordare.

1568
02:30:43,480 --> 02:30:45,040
So. Now, confutatis...

1569
02:30:45,240 --> 02:30:47,800
...when the wicked are confounded.

1570
02:30:51,560 --> 02:30:53,480
How would you translate that?

1571
02:30:54,080 --> 02:30:55,560
''Consigned to flames of woe.''

1572
02:30:58,760 --> 02:30:59,840
You believe in it?

1573
02:31:02,680 --> 02:31:05,280
A fire which never dies,
burning you forever.

1574
02:31:08,040 --> 02:31:09,160
Yes.

1575
02:31:10,600 --> 02:31:12,240
Is it possible?

1576
02:31:13,600 --> 02:31:14,520
Let's begin.

1577
02:31:16,320 --> 02:31:17,600
We ended in F-major.

1578
02:31:18,040 --> 02:31:19,080
So now...

1579
02:31:19,280 --> 02:31:20,480
...A-minor.

1580
02:31:34,080 --> 02:31:36,200
Confutatis. A-minor.

1581
02:31:39,160 --> 02:31:40,240
Start with voices.

1582
02:31:41,280 --> 02:31:43,280
Basses first.
Second beat of the first--

1583
02:31:43,480 --> 02:31:44,480
Time? Time?

1584
02:31:44,680 --> 02:31:47,680
Common time.
Second beat of the first measure.

1585
02:31:50,040 --> 02:31:51,200
On ''A.''

1586
02:31:53,120 --> 02:31:54,440
Second measure, second beat.

1587
02:31:55,680 --> 02:31:56,480
You see?

1588
02:31:57,120 --> 02:31:58,080
Yes. D-sharp?

1589
02:31:58,280 --> 02:31:59,320
Of course.

1590
02:31:59,960 --> 02:32:02,040
Second beat of the
third measure, on ''E.''

1591
02:32:08,920 --> 02:32:10,240
Do you have me?

1592
02:32:10,560 --> 02:32:11,400
Show me!

1593
02:32:30,320 --> 02:32:31,400
Good.

1594
02:32:33,040 --> 02:32:34,360
Now the tenors.

1595
02:32:34,760 --> 02:32:37,280
Fourth beat of the first measure.
On ''C.''

1596
02:32:39,760 --> 02:32:43,160
Second measure.
Fourth beat. ''D.''

1597
02:32:46,480 --> 02:32:47,560
Yes, continue!

1598
02:32:47,800 --> 02:32:50,280
Second beat of the
fourth measure, on ''F.''

1599
02:32:57,560 --> 02:33:01,240
Now the orchestra. Second bassoon
and bass trombones with the basses.

1600
02:33:01,440 --> 02:33:03,360
Identical notes and rhythm.

1601
02:33:06,760 --> 02:33:09,400
First bassoon, tenor trombones,
with the tenors.

1602
02:33:15,560 --> 02:33:16,560
You go too fast.

1603
02:33:17,440 --> 02:33:18,200
Too fast!

1604
02:33:18,400 --> 02:33:19,280
Do you have it?

1605
02:33:19,480 --> 02:33:20,560
Trombone with what?

1606
02:33:20,800 --> 02:33:21,400
Tenors.

1607
02:33:22,760 --> 02:33:23,440
Identical?

1608
02:33:23,600 --> 02:33:25,960
Of course!
The instruments doubling the voices!

1609
02:33:26,160 --> 02:33:27,360
Trumpets and timpani.

1610
02:33:27,880 --> 02:33:29,480
Trumpets in ''D.''

1611
02:33:30,600 --> 02:33:31,520
Listen!

1612
02:33:32,360 --> 02:33:35,200
Trumpets in ''D,'' tonic and dominant.
First and third beats.

1613
02:33:37,840 --> 02:33:39,720
It goes with the harmony!

1614
02:33:56,920 --> 02:33:59,280
Yes, I understand.
Yes! And that's all?

1615
02:33:59,480 --> 02:34:02,000
No. Now for the real fire.
Strings in unison.

1616
02:34:02,360 --> 02:34:03,840
Ostinato on ''A.''

1617
02:34:04,040 --> 02:34:05,120
Like this!

1618
02:34:08,120 --> 02:34:10,040
Next measure is rising.

1619
02:34:11,880 --> 02:34:13,080
Do you have it?

1620
02:34:13,240 --> 02:34:14,160
Show me!

1621
02:34:21,160 --> 02:34:21,920
Wonderful!

1622
02:34:23,080 --> 02:34:24,320
Go on.

1623
02:34:31,480 --> 02:34:32,800
Write that down!

1624
02:34:36,720 --> 02:34:38,600
Call me among the blessed.

1625
02:34:39,840 --> 02:34:41,280
''C'' major.

1626
02:34:41,480 --> 02:34:43,040
Sopranos and altos in thirds.

1627
02:34:43,240 --> 02:34:45,760
Altos on ''C,''
sopranos above.

1628
02:34:58,240 --> 02:35:00,840
Sopranos up to ''F'' on the second voca?

1629
02:35:01,120 --> 02:35:02,160
And on dictis!

1630
02:35:02,360 --> 02:35:04,920
And underneath, just violins.
Arpeggios.

1631
02:35:07,480 --> 02:35:10,440
Descending scale in eighth notes,
then back to the Ostinato.

1632
02:35:10,600 --> 02:35:11,840
That's it. You have it?

1633
02:35:12,040 --> 02:35:13,440
You go too fast.

1634
02:35:13,920 --> 02:35:15,960
One moment please!
One moment!

1635
02:35:19,720 --> 02:35:21,240
Good! Show me!
The whole thing!

1636
02:35:21,440 --> 02:35:22,760
From the beginning!

1637
02:37:21,520 --> 02:37:22,600
Want to rest?

1638
02:37:24,480 --> 02:37:26,480
No, I'm not tired at all!

1639
02:37:31,880 --> 02:37:33,160
We'll stop...

1640
02:37:33,360 --> 02:37:36,520
...for a moment.
Then we'll finish the lacrimosa.

1641
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:38,440
I can keep going, I assure you!

1642
02:37:40,080 --> 02:37:41,880
Stay with me while I sleep a little?

1643
02:37:44,600 --> 02:37:45,680
I won't leave you!

1644
02:37:54,320 --> 02:37:55,560
I’m so ashamed.

1645
02:37:57,680 --> 02:37:58,480
Of what?

1646
02:38:00,080 --> 02:38:01,680
I was foolish.

1647
02:38:02,720 --> 02:38:05,120
I thought you did not care
for my work...

1648
02:38:05,440 --> 02:38:06,720
...or me.

1649
02:38:10,520 --> 02:38:12,000
Forgive me.

1650
02:39:14,200 --> 02:39:15,600
What are you doing here?

1651
02:39:18,320 --> 02:39:20,360
Your husband...

1652
02:39:20,520 --> 02:39:21,880
...took sick.

1653
02:39:22,880 --> 02:39:24,320
I brought him home.

1654
02:39:26,560 --> 02:39:27,520
Why you?

1655
02:39:29,400 --> 02:39:32,360
Because Madame, I was at hand.

1656
02:39:36,240 --> 02:39:38,600
Thank you very much,
you can go now.

1657
02:39:41,440 --> 02:39:42,480
He needs me.

1658
02:39:44,120 --> 02:39:45,800
No, he doesn't...

1659
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:47,920
...and I don't want you here.

1660
02:39:48,840 --> 02:39:49,920
Just go, please.

1661
02:39:50,440 --> 02:39:51,720
He asked me to stay.

1662
02:39:52,080 --> 02:39:53,480
And I'm asking--

1663
02:40:22,200 --> 02:40:23,160
I'm back.

1664
02:40:27,200 --> 02:40:29,040
I missed you so much.

1665
02:40:33,800 --> 02:40:35,440
If you'd just...

1666
02:40:36,600 --> 02:40:38,920
...show me that you need me.

1667
02:40:45,280 --> 02:40:47,480
And I'll try to do better, too.

1668
02:40:59,680 --> 02:41:01,120
What is this?

1669
02:41:04,720 --> 02:41:06,600
No, Wolfie, not this.

1670
02:41:12,280 --> 02:41:15,240
You're not to work on this ever again.

1671
02:41:16,760 --> 02:41:17,800
I've decided.

1672
02:41:22,160 --> 02:41:23,480
It's not his handwriting.

1673
02:41:26,520 --> 02:41:27,880
No, it's mine.

1674
02:41:29,200 --> 02:41:30,680
I was assisting him.

1675
02:41:32,440 --> 02:41:34,520
He's not to work on this anymore.

1676
02:41:35,680 --> 02:41:37,200
It's making him ill.

1677
02:41:40,920 --> 02:41:41,920
Good night.

1678
02:41:45,080 --> 02:41:48,920
I regret we have no servants
to show you out, Herr Salieri.

1679
02:41:49,160 --> 02:41:50,520
Respect my wish and go.

1680
02:41:54,480 --> 02:41:56,240
I will respect his.

1681
02:45:52,360 --> 02:45:54,160
Your merciful God.

1682
02:45:58,280 --> 02:46:00,040
He destroyed his own beloved...

1683
02:46:00,240 --> 02:46:02,560
...rather than let a mediocrity...

1684
02:46:02,760 --> 02:46:06,320
...share in the smallest part
of his glory.

1685
02:46:07,920 --> 02:46:09,800
He killed Mozart.

1686
02:46:10,280 --> 02:46:12,720
And kept me alive to torture.

1687
02:46:13,360 --> 02:46:17,040
32 years of torture.
32 years...

1688
02:46:17,240 --> 02:46:20,600
...of slowly watching myself
become extinct!

1689
02:46:21,120 --> 02:46:22,480
My music...

1690
02:46:23,400 --> 02:46:25,120
...growing fainter.

1691
02:46:25,480 --> 02:46:27,800
All the time fainter...

1692
02:46:28,480 --> 02:46:30,800
...till no one plays it at all.

1693
02:46:32,280 --> 02:46:33,360
And his....

1694
02:46:35,280 --> 02:46:36,200
Good morning!

1695
02:46:37,040 --> 02:46:39,160
Time for the water closet.

1696
02:46:40,360 --> 02:46:42,240
Then we have your favorite breakfast.

1697
02:46:42,440 --> 02:46:44,600
Sugar rolls!
He loves those.

1698
02:46:45,240 --> 02:46:47,200
Fresh sugar rolls.

1699
02:46:47,880 --> 02:46:50,320
I will speak for you, Father.

1700
02:46:50,720 --> 02:46:53,560
I speak for all mediocrities
in the world.

1701
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:56,440
I am their champion.

1702
02:46:57,000 --> 02:46:59,200
I am their patron saint.

1703
02:47:09,480 --> 02:47:11,880
Mediocrities everywhere...

1704
02:47:13,480 --> 02:47:14,720
...I absolve you.

1705
02:47:17,600 --> 02:47:19,240
I absolve you.

1706
02:47:28,360 --> 02:47:29,880
I absolve you all.
