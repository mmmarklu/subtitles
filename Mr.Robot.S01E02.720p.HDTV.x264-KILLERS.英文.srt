28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,430
What I'm about to tell you is top secret,

29
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,090
Evil Corp.

30
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:07,130
Tyrell Wellick.

31
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:08,610
You want to do these together then?

32
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:09,780
Pure Molly...

33
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:10,750
No, Shayla. 

34
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,360
I need you to come to AllSafe.

35
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,620
Shit. They're in the network?

36
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,600
This is it. Fsociety.

37
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,380
They're telling me to leave it here.

38
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:20,200
Who are you?

39
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,410
I think you should come with me.

40
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,020
Yeah, that's Darlene.

41
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,060
You are going to modify the dat file

42
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:26,540
put Colby's IP in there.

43
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:27,400
You do that,

44
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:31,120
you have set in motion the largest revolution the world will ever see.

45
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,610
sources have confirmed the hacks were

46
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:37,870
in part tied to Colby's terminal.

47
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:39,670
Sir, step inside the car.

48
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:47,570
Bon soir, Elliot.

49
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,950
"Give a man a gun and he can rob a bank,

50
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,630
but give a man a bank, and he can rob the world."

51
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,950
It's a bit of a silly expression, actually.

52
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,000
A little reductive, but still...

53
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:24,440
I like it,

54
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,480
for the same reason most people hate it,

55
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,840
because to me it means that 

56
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,370
power belongs to the people that take it.

57
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:34,550
Nothing to do with their hard work, strong ambitions,

58
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:36,790
or rightful qualifications, no.

59
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:42,500
The actual will to take is often the only thing that's necessary.

60
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:46,030
I'm sorry to bring you in like this.

61
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,130
Technically what we're doing might be considered illegal,

62
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,820
which is why I'm surrounded

63
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,960
by eleven of our most annoying lawyers.

64
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:58,120
Elliot Alderson...

65
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,570
I want to offer you

66
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:06,340
a position here at Evil Corp.

67
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,730
I want you to head our cybersecurity division.

68
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,030
Except I can't officially offer you anything

69
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,430
since we have this non-compete with your employer, Allsafe.

70
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,790
But if you do this of your own accord--

71
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,450
when you do this--

72
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:26,380
you'll be a multi-millionaire within the next five years.

73
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,560
What do you say?

74
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,470
Can I--

75
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,190
Can I think about it?

76
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,510
Gentlemen, I need the room.

77
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,040
Yes, thank you. Yes, yes.

78
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:13,790
You know,

79
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:18,790
Evil Corp has just named me interim CTO.

80
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,620
It won't be long until it's official.

81
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:26,030
I will be the youngest executive this company has ever seen.

82
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:29,400
I should track down these hackers out there

83
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,820
just to thank them.

84
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,430
In a way, it's kind of, um...

85
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,240
What's the word in English?

86
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,440
Serendipitous? Right?

87
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,930
You know, by the end of the quarter,

88
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,400
we're going to revamp our entire network

89
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,890
and consolidate our security protocols.

90
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:06,050
We're going to handle everything internally,

91
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:10,150
which means all of our vendors, including Allsafe,

92
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,640
will be cut loose.

93
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,280
And it's no secret that once Allsafe loses us as a client,

94
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,480
they'll be fini.

95
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,750
And when that happens,

96
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,090
I want you to be where you belong:

97
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:22,840
here with me.

98
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,580
This is an important choice you're making, Elliot.

99
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,490
I just wanted you to know all the facts

100
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:31,620
before you made your final decision.

101
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:46,390
I think I'm happy where I am.

102
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,690
Well, I thought I'd ask.

103
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,530
Call this number if you need to get in touch with Mr. Wellick.

104
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:01,180
You can call me Mr. X.

105
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,190
Come on, you've never seen JFK?

107
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:09,530
Oliver Stone movie?

108
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,040
Sir, I gotta be honest. That's embarrassing.

109
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,480
Do yourself a favor and watch it.

110
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,950
And pay, for Christ's sake.

111
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,080
Anyway, you can call me Mr. Sutherland for now.

112
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,290
Don't hesitate to reach me when you're ready.

113
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,870
We're always close by.

114
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,980
I'm gonna set a date right now--

115
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,010
- No, we're not. - For later.

116
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:40,390
I gotta go, thank you very much.

117
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,840
- You gonna have me up? - No.

118
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,440
- Gonna have me up? - No, stop.

119
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,930
- I'm coming up. - No, you're not coming up.

120
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,490
Another time. Okay, I gotta go.

121
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,470
Come on.

122
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:57,370
- Everything all right? - Yeah, he's just a creeper.

123
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,880
I hate it when your employers can't take a hint.

124
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,370
Hey, is your radiator messed up?

125
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:10,000
Because it's like 3,000 degrees in my apartment.

126
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:15,240
Hey, are you okay? You seem off.

127
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,670
While we're here, you mind if I reup?

128
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,990
A little early to reup, don't you think?

129
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,710
I'm deviating from the schedule a little.

130
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,760
Whoa, never thought I'd see the day, Mr. Stricty Pants,

131
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,730
but okie dokie.

132
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,390
Oh, yeah. Shit, I'm out of the other ones.

133
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,720
No, just the morphine. It's good.

134
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:38,630
Uh, no, you made me promise never to give you these

135
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,030
unless I had your Subs.

136
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,660
- Shayla. - No, Elliot.

137
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,490
Promises matter, okay?

138
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:47,620
I take this shit to heart.

139
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,820
Oh, my God.

140
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,890
Fine, but you have to promise me you won't do a lot

141
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,600
until I get your withdrawal meds, okay?

142
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,610
I'll go see Fernando later or something.

143
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:03,570
No, you have to say it.

144
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:08,400
I promise.

145
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:20,040
Hey, man.

146
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:23,110
What, you think I forgot about you?

147
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:25,210
Trust me, I need you now more than ever.

148
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,830
We gotta get to work.

149
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,460
Hacking Tyrell Wellick, you'd think it'd be tricky,

150
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,960
but it wasn't--Evil Corp's corporate mail servers,

151
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,220
they haven't patched anything since Shellshock.

152
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,040
He doesn't even use two-step verification.

153
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,830
His password was just his wife's maiden name

154
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:44,520
and Sweden's independence date, 6-6.

155
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,930
One six away from the obvious, but still,

156
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:48,890
this is bad noob practice.

158
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,900
These emails...

159
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:00,960
His life... it's nice, happy, perfect.

162
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,540
This doesn't make sense.

163
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,070
Did he know I was going to hack him?

164
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,220
Did he let me?

165
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,480
I'm gonna need to wipe everything.

166
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,370
I know, I know, taking more than I should.

167
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:16,060
I'm breaking my rule, but come on, it's an off week.

168
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,340
Come on.

169
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,610
My man, you gotta--

170
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:04,600
You gotta deuce it out over here, all right?

171
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,390
Yo, you gotta do your business up in here, all right?

172
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:17,840
You got this. You got this.

173
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,000
Terry Colby, the chief technology officer of--

174
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,480
Terry Colby's arrest is on everyone's mind.

175
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:53,540
Screen. Might as well be the same thing nowadays.

177
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,650
How do I go back to work after this?

178
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,520
How can I focus on anything?

179
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:02,070
And when's Mr. Robot going to contact me again?

180
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,420
What's he waiting for?

181
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,960
Did I just destroy a man's life for no reason?

182
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,890
I'm gonna talk to HR about a salary bump for you.

183
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:11,480
- Oh, please. - No, no.

184
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,520
Take the raise.

185
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:16,240
It's not gonna be much, but it's the best I can do right now.

186
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:18,510
Elliot...

187
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:20,460
You saved the company.

188
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:25,150
Now...

189
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,350
Why didn't you tell me about the dat file?

190
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,900
You could've come in here at any time before the meeting

191
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,770
to say you found something, but you didn't.

192
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,950
I gotta be honest. I found that kind of curious.

193
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:44,700
Yeah, I didn't know what I had.

194
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:48,440
Could've easily been a junk file.

195
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,430
C'mon...

196
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,870
You're never sure about anything

197
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,170
unless there's something to be sure about.

198
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,060
Maybe you don't know me that well.

199
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,160
Regardless,

200
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,700
I still need you to stay on it, now more than ever.

201
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,100
I mean, who knows what these fsociety hackers are going to do next.

202
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:09,980
What did he just say?

203
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:12,710
- What did you just say? - The ones working with Colby.

204
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,220
Who knows how deep these data dumps are going to get,

205
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,430
and Evil Corp is--

206
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,840
What're you talking about?

207
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,140
There's a twist.

208
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,010
You're usually the one a step ahead of me.

209
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:26,170
They hit the mother lode during the breach.

210
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,480
Potentially terabytes worth of emails and files.

211
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,320
They're threatening to dump everything

212
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,550
unless the FBI frees Colby.

213
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,480
They released the video this morning.

215
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:47,060
Hello, Evil Corp. We are fsociety.

216
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:49,190
Over the years, we have been watching you.

217
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,160
Your financial abuse of the poor;

218
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,100
your corruption of governments;

219
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,080
your cover-ups of the murder of innocent, ordinary citizens,

220
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,100
all for the sake of a profit.

221
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,960
This is why we at fsociety have decided you must die.

222
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:05,950
We are malicious and hostile. We do not compromise.

223
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:07,610
We are relentless.

224
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,620
We will not stop until every tentacle

225
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:13,630
of your evil monstrosity is sliced off at the nerve.

226
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:16,010
But we are also not without mercy.

227
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:18,670
Our latest hack was our last warning.

228
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:22,410
Meet our demands, and we will consider not destroying you.

229
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:24,920
First, release our leader Terry Colby

230
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,230
from your illegitimate prison immediately.

231
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:30,460
Second, release all the people of the world

232
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:33,820
from your even more illegitimate prisons of debt.

233
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,440
Third, dissolve your corporation

234
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:40,320
and donate all your assets to charities around the world.

236
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:42,630
This proposal is non-negotiable.

238
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:45,300
The people are realizing they don't have freedom of choice

239
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,830
so long as you exist.

240
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,640
The people are waking up,

241
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,550
no longer accepting your economic slavery.

243
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:55,460
Meet these demands, or we will kill you.

244
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,360
Consider yourself warned.

246
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,400
Play it again.

247
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,710
Yo, yo, yo, yo, my album just dropped.

248
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,470
Yo, please buy my CD. Only cost you 20 likes.

249
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,100
Yo, it'll give you the feels, y'all, I swear.

250
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,220
The CD's free. All's I ask is you Tweet.

251
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,480
Help my social media outreach.

252
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:17,910
You know, be like, "I want to set up this meeting.

253
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,450
It's like a very, like a--"

254
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:20,710
Oh, Elliot!

255
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:22,110
Hey, congrats, man.

256
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,790
Allsafe is all over the internet today because of you.

257
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:27,430
Dude, we should celebrate. We have this Groupon

258
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:29,570
for four at Morton's on Thursday.

259
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:31,760
This other couple we were going with totally bailed.

260
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,850
Why don't you come with?

261
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,910
Their steaks are badass. It's $29.95--

262
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,390
I'm not sure that Elliot would like that.

263
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,530
Yeah, okay.

264
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,030
Yeah? Okay. Awesome, man.

265
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:42,590
And, hey, why don't we make it a double date?

266
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,070
I heard that you had a girlfriend.

267
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,410
Ollie, you weren't supposed to say anything.

268
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:47,870
Babe, it's cool. Elliot's okay with it.

269
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:50,160
Yeah, okay, sure. I--have to go.

270
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,660
Um, my neighbor's complaining about the dog barking again.

271
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,690
Since when does he have a dog?

272
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:03,790
You look like a beautiful couple.

273
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,200
Yo, my album just dropped,

274
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,730
You like rap, hip-hop?

275
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,600
Yo, this shit is deep, lyrical, poetic.

276
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,390
Yo, your girl will like this, my man, I swear.

277
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:12,510
Come on, bro, you've been outside our building for two weeks now.

278
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:14,230
All right, you know, I'll take it,

279
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,560
if you leave us alone.

280
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,390
Thank you, thank you, man, thank you.

281
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:19,720
And I'll tweet, but only if I like it, all right?

282
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,540
I only have 48 followers, but it's growing.

283
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,900
- No doubt, no doubt. - Some tastemakers in there so--

284
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,330
I feel you, I feel you.

285
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,130
- Yeah. - All right.

286
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:26,860
Yo, I appreciate it, man, really.

287
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:27,940
- You guys have a good day. - Yeah, you too.

288
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,630
Thank you so much. Check track two out.

289
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,500
- Track two. - All right, man.

290
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,010
This was never part of the plan.

291
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:36,210
Data dumps? Releasing Terry Colby?

292
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:37,830
None of this makes sense.

293
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,520
Need to cut off all ties with fsociety.

294
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,190
Need to disconnect.

295
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,210
We need to call in sick and lie low for a--

296
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,820
Dude! Jesus Christ! I am naked, asshole!

297
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,680
Don't stare at me!

298
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:06,480
Why the hell are you in my shower?

299
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,470
Well, I was waiting for you.

300
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:09,720
You were supposed to come last night.

301
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,300
- Did you forget? - Come? Where?

302
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,500
It's fine, everyone's coming later.

303
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:22,730
I'm stealing your clothes.

304
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:25,450
My dress has cum stains on it.

305
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:31,290
Jesus, I am just messing with you.

306
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:32,560
My stuff is just in the wash.

307
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,400
I'm gonna borrow this for the time being.

308
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,290
Oh, by the way,

309
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,430
your dog shat on your bed.

310
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,830
You gotta walk that thing.

311
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,770
Hey, please take Flipper for a while.

312
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:48,400
She probably needs a walk or something.

313
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,120
She keeps shitting everywhere.

314
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,290
Of course she needs a walk, Elliot.

315
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:52,530
She's a friggin' dog.

316
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:55,520
Yo, I want to stop and get some froyo before we go.

317
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:00,080
Uh, I'll be back later.

318
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,740
- I owe you. - Yeah, big time.

319
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:17,090
How do you know where I live?

320
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:19,140
Why wouldn't I know where you live?

321
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,210
I don't know. I don't know where you live.

322
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,250
I don't live anywhere at the present.

323
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:34,490
The douche I was dating proposed to me, can you believe?

324
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:36,720
I mean, what an asshole.

325
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,750
Anyways, we got into this huge fight, and--

326
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:41,900
What the hell am I doing?

327
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,530
This chick is out of her mind batshit crazy.

328
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:46,540
I gotta go back, tell Gideon everything.

329
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,860
He'll understand, right?

330
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,250
He'll know what to do.

331
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,710
It's whatevs. He'll take me back.

332
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:52,990
He's just gotta get over this whole

333
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:55,340
"Love is forever" bullshit.

334
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,730
I'll do my disappearing act for a minute,

335
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:59,720
and then he'll come to his senses.

336
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,940
- Stand clear of the closing door. - You know, it's our thing.

337
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,260
Quick!

338
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:16,330
Can she see them, too?

339
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:17,450
What?

340
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:19,400
I like to stay on my toes.

341
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:25,550
Speaking of, that's, like, one of the most annoying things--

342
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:28,110
But what if Tyrell finds out? What will he do?

343
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:31,580
Shit, there's basically no scenario in which

344
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,610
I'm not getting killed or going to jail.

345
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:38,020
Because I wanted a turtle, and he was like, "No--"

346
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:40,210
I might need to crash with you for a couple of nights.

347
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:41,730
That's cool, right?

348
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:43,880
Seriously?

349
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:46,560
Fine! I'll crash at Mobley's.

350
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:48,710
Don't love dogs anyway.

351
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:50,710
Especially ones that shit in your bed.

352
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:52,600
I mean, how do you live like that, honestly?

353
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,660
How do you go to sleep when you know that there's...

354
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,270
For all we know,

355
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:57,580
I could be walking into a trap right now.

356
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,920
We could be dead the second I walk through that door.

357
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:03,610
Come on, kid. We got big things in store.

358
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,980
Big things.

359
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,620
Man of the hour. Take a curtsy.

360
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,920
Goddamn ducks.

361
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,850
Hey, hey, man!

362
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:29,040
What's... Oh. Shit, sorry, sorry, dude.

363
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,300
Um, okay.

364
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:33,090
Anyway, just, awesome work, man.

365
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:34,010
Really awesome.

366
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:35,380
Right on, man. Right on.

367
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:36,710
- Real cool. - Great.

368
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:39,400
So now that we're all done going down on each other,

369
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:41,660
can we please hear the plan?

370
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,340
Where are we at with Steel Mountain?

371
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,660
If I'm not mistaken,

372
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,350
these lines aren't 100% safe yet,

373
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:48,310
and we still haven't made the Colby project disappear.

374
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,230
Seriously?

375
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:51,420
It's been weeks. Any links or traces

376
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:52,720
would have been owned by now.

377
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,210
The lines are clean, Boss, I swear.

378
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,640
- Thank you. - I mean, um...

379
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,790
if it makes you feel better, Romero and I can check...

380
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,010
Great! Make me feel great.

381
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:04,840
I'm gonna hang back over here, collect my thoughts.

382
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:16,090
What's her deal?

383
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,080
Ah, she's a complicated woman.

384
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,980
Most malware coders are. Am I right?

385
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,030
She showed up at my apartment.

386
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:24,230
Why does she know where I live?

387
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:25,250
Let's not focus on her.

388
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,930
That'll be like entering a bad K-hole you'll never wake up from.

389
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:30,590
Instead, I need you to focus on the next phase of our project.

390
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:33,120
Comet, the natural gas plant up around Albany?

391
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:37,900
We're gonna blow it up.

392
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,580
Why would you blow...

393
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:44,160
Comet plant's right next to Steel Mountain.

394
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,780
Which, as you know,

395
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,590
is the off-site and data storage facility

396
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,400
for every corporation in the S&P,

397
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,460
including everyone's favorite--

398
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,350
- Evil Corp. - Bingo!

399
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,520
You're gonna destroy their tape backups.

400
00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:59,130
They're gonna be looking out for something like that.

401
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,760
They've been on high alert ever since the hack.

402
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,210
From what I heard, they've caught their hacker.

403
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:05,530
- Haven't they? - No, they haven't.

404
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:08,210
- Tyrell Wellick knows. - What they want him to know!

405
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:10,350
He's a corporate robot just like the rest of them.

406
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:12,530
Besides, the entire company is gonna be reeling

407
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:14,400
from all the data dumps we've got in store for them--

408
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,180
and man, do we have some goodies.

409
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,890
Some good old-fashioned executive racism,

410
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:19,770
sexism, Fascism.

411
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:22,200
Trust me, we are gonna "ism" so much all over them

412
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,690
they won't be able to see straight.

413
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:25,910
And asking for Colby's release as ransom was genius.

414
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:27,550
That'll only make his spotlight bigger,

415
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:29,000
keeping it off us.

416
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,340
That neat little ditty was Trenton's idea.

417
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:34,200
She may look innocent, but I'd be careful.

418
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:36,450
She's got some Allah Akbar in her.

419
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,740
And while all that's going on,

420
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:41,200
you will use your Allsafe security clearance

421
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,650
to hack the Comet PLC, increase the pressure,

422
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:45,430
causing a gas pipeline explosion

423
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:49,180
making Steel Mountain go kablooey along with Evil Corp's soul.

424
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,960
They know about all this?

425
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,020
You're the first.

426
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,650
Workers?

427
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:05,160
Anyone living around the plant...

428
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:06,730
They all die?

429
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:08,360
We'll give them a head start.

430
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,120
Sound some alarms. They'll be fine.

431
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,430
You're blowing up a gas pipeline.

432
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:17,750
The world is a dangerous place, Elliot,

433
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:19,260
not because of those who do evil,

434
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:21,890
but because of those who look on and do nothing.

435
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:22,950
This is war.

436
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,940
People will die. C'est la mort.

437
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,410
And once we blow up the pipeline,

438
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:30,860
Darlene's worm will kick into high gear

439
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:31,900
at the U.S. Data center

440
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,530
which you helped to us install, thank you very much.

441
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:38,720
The redundant backups at their eastern data center in China--

442
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:41,640
the Dark Army is covering us on that.

443
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:44,590
Dark Army? Why, man?

444
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:46,570
They got no code. They hack for anyone:

445
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:48,370
terrorists, North Korea, Iran, Russia--

446
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:51,600
Which means they hate U.S. capitalism just as much as anyone.

447
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,660
Last but not least.

448
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,130
Steel Mountain.

449
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:00,280
The hacker's dilemma. 

450
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:03,370
What to do when a bunch of data you want to destroy

451
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:05,170
is completely off the grid?

452
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,820
I'm not killing anyone.

453
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:17,320
Tell me one thing, Elliot.

454
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:20,080
Are you a one or a zero?

455
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:23,310
That's the question you have to ask yourself.

456
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:25,140
Are you a yes or a no?

457
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,580
Are you going to act or not?

458
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:34,250
Yo...you've been staring at a computer screen

459
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,180
way too long, homie.

460
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:38,140
Life's not that binary.

461
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,370
Isn't it?

462
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:41,980
Sure, there are grays--

463
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:44,410
but when you come right down to it, at its core,

464
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:48,190
beneath every choice, there's either a one or a zero.

465
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,950
You either do something or you don't.

466
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:54,100
You walk out that door, you've decided to do nothing,

467
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:57,450
to say no, which means you do not come back.

468
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:00,980
You leave, you are no longer a part of this.

469
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,550
You become a zero.

470
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,740
If you stay,

471
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,440
if you want to change the world,

472
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:10,810
you become a yes.

473
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:13,050
You become a one.

474
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:15,580
So, I'll ask you again:

475
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:19,180
are you a one or a zero?

476
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:21,410
An innocent man is in prison because of what I did.

477
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:23,250
Come on, let's not kid ourselves!

478
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,170
This has nothing to do with Colby.

479
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,730
This isn't even about my revolution.

480
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,310
This is more than that for you.

481
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:37,310
This is about how those bastards slowly killed your father

482
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:39,020
and how you wished he'd done something about it.

483
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:41,910
But he didn't. Because he was a zero,

484
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:44,030
just like you're being right now.

485
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,560
F--- you.

486
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,080
Disappearing again?

487
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:59,760
I'm not killing anyone. Leave me out of this.

488
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:03,750
You don't get to disappear from this.

489
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,260
We can do it with or without you,

490
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:07,150
but you're a part of it either way!

491
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:10,870
Yeah, even your stupid hoodie can't protect you, bitch!

492
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:12,090
This was a mistake.

493
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:14,050
I've gotta turn them in. Should I turn them in?

494
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:16,380
Will I get into trouble? Shit, she's right.

495
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:19,010
I'm culpable now. No, we're culpable.

496
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:22,550
You're in this with me, so start thinking of solutions now.

497
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:28,460
Shayla?

498
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:35,730
Yo, Shayla.

499
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,190
Yo, bro.

500
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:39,890
Can I help you with something?

501
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:46,500
I, uh...just need to talk to Shayla.

502
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,050
Oh, your girl.

503
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:49,940
She in the tub.

504
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,450
Shayla.

505
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:58,460
Yo, she'll be out in a minute.

506
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,320
Can sit and wait if you want.

507
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:06,930
I think we should check on her, make sure she's all right.

508
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:11,950
You a funny dude. I like you.

509
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,460
Don't be rude.

510
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:17,250
Sit down and chill.

511
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,360
No, that's right.

512
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,890
You only do this.

513
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:46,780
Only nigga I know that take withdrawal meds while he using.

514
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:48,660
That's smart.

515
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,270
Probably even convinced yourself you ain't an addict.

516
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,020
Oh, shit.

517
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:57,690
Forgot to introduce myself. I'm Fernan--

518
00:27:57,690 --> 00:27:59,430
Fernando Vera, Shayla's supplier.

519
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:01,350
One of the worst human beings I've ever hacked.

520
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:05,250
His password? "Eatadick6969."

521
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:08,840
Aside from the massive amounts of money he spends on porn and webcams,

522
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:12,650
he does all his drug transactions through emails, IMs, Twitter.

523
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,520
The fact that the cops haven't caught him yet is beyond me.

524
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,780
If they had half a brain cell,

525
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:19,510
they'd be able to crack his gang's simplistic code,

526
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:21,250
if it can even be called that.

527
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,940
After only a couple of hours of timing his tweets

528
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,380
with related news articles,

529
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,240
I figured out that "biscuit" and "clickety"

530
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,150
clearly referenced guns.

531
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:31,940
"Food," "sea shells" or "gas" for bullets.

532
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:34,890
And the ultimate: "Rock to sleep early."

533
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:37,240
I haven't made the direct connection to a hit yet,

534
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,970
but the math of guns plus bullets

535
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:40,930
usually adds up to one thing.

536
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,770
I've thought about turning him in,

537
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:44,740
but he's Shayla's only supplier.

538
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,040
I take him down, I lose my drugs,

539
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:50,300
and with everything going on right now, I can't have that.

540
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,850
You get that, though?

541
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:54,950
Anyway, bro,

542
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:57,120
I ain't nothing to worry about.

543
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,100
Just making a drop for you.

544
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:03,310
What's your name, anyway?

545
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,720
Elliot.

546
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,460
What it mean?

547
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,190
What, you ain't never Googled it?

548
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:13,030
Man, you gotta do that.

549
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:15,540
The meaning of a person's name is important, bro.

550
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,260
Yo, she good! She good.

551
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:24,000
Trust me.

552
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:26,530
Took care of that shit myself.

553
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:34,300
You remind me of me when I was younger,

554
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:36,110
depressed and sullen.

555
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:39,230
Matter of fact, tried to kill myself, a couple of times.

556
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,410
Never could get that shit right.

557
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,160
Biology wasn't my strong suit.

558
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:49,150
I hated myself, man. Still do.

559
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:52,230
Thought that shit was a weakness for a long time.

560
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:01,050
Then I realized that shit was my power.

561
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:05,410
People walk around, act like they know what hate means.

562
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:09,970
Nah, no one does, until you hate yourself.

563
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:11,120
I mean...

564
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:14,080
truly hate yourself.

565
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:17,230
That's power.

566
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:31,090
You ain't scared of me, are you?

567
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,170
That's good.

568
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,590
Means I didn't waste my time making friends with you.

569
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,840
You don't really need these, do you?

570
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,090
Man of your courage can last through a little withdrawal.

571
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:52,660
Ya know, you the only reason why I met Shayla.

572
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,420
I'm the only nigga in town carrying everything,

573
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,990
including your precious Suboxone.

574
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:02,770
So, in a weird way, I should be thanking you.

575
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,360
You brought her to me.

576
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:07,480
Your star orbiting with mine, gravitationally,

577
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:10,810
brought me the love of my life, Elliot.

578
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:13,070
I mean, this, us?

579
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,240
Being here?

580
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,900
This has...

581
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,640
beautiful meaning.

582
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:22,120
But make no mistake, that girl in there...

583
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,540
is mine.

584
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,510
I don't know what I'd do without her.

585
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,860
Now, I don't know what kind of arrangement

586
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:34,750
you had with her before, but now that we friends...

587
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:38,500
I trust you respect this boundary.

588
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:40,610
Feel me?

589
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:53,860
A dude earlier today gave me that same look.

590
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:56,070
Only thing I gotta say is,

591
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,540
there's a smart time to be scared, bro...

592
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:02,260
and a stupid time.

593
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,090
Shayla?

594
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:10,820
The lock pick.

595
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,620
Every hacker's favorite sport.

596
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,020
The perfect system to crack,

597
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:16,090
mostly because unlike virtual systems,

598
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:17,940
when you break it, you can feel it.

599
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,840
You can see it. You can hear it.

600
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,290
Shayla.

601
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:34,050
Wake up.

602
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,880
What happened?

603
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:42,260
You okay?

604
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,970
Why was that asshole here?

605
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,000
Why am I in the tub?

606
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:56,120
I don't know, um...I told him I needed your pills.

607
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,160
He came over. We smoked a little.

608
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,250
You remember having sex with him?

609
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:05,080
What? No.

610
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:07,300
But he definitely does.

611
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,340
Okay, let's go.

612
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,540
- Get your purse, make sure-- - Stop.

613
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:12,790
I'm not going anywhere, okay?

614
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:15,420
What do you mean?

615
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,330
Oh, he's just gonna get away with it?

616
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,840
You can't go back to him. Hey, I don't need the pills.

617
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,720
- Just find someone else. - I can't.

618
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:31,150
He gives me a really good deal on the split.

619
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,360
I make good money.

620
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:35,550
There it is again,

621
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:38,060
the invisible hand at work, controlling us,

622
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:40,850
even if it pushes us past our threshold of pain.

623
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,490
It's not gonna stop.

624
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,650
What if he does it again?

625
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:48,090
Promise me you won't do anything?

626
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,480
I'm serious, Elliot.

627
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,580
There's nothing to be done here.

628
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:56,870
It's not like I have a choice.

629
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,500
Would you mind sleeping here tonight?

630
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:08,990
Choices.

631
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:11,650
Maybe Mr. Robot's right.

632
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:15,790
That's what this is all about, the yesses and nos of life.

633
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:19,110
But do we decide them or do they decide us?

634
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,950
Fernando Vera. I get rid of him,

635
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:24,230
I get rid of my drug dealer's supplier.

636
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:25,810
I get rid of the morphine.

637
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:28,400
And the pain I've been holding in comes rushing out.

638
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,200
Sure, I can try to find another dealer,

639
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,230
but like Vera said, no one on the streets deals Suboxone.

640
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:36,820
I could go back to digitally counterfeiting scripts,

641
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:39,620
but pharmas spend a lot of dough protecting their wares.

642
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:41,990
Most places only take paper scripts.

643
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,800
Continuously getting legit refills isn't realistic,

644
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,490
and neither is being a junkie.

645
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,830
So I quit cold turkey or let Vera exist.

646
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,750
I know what you're thinking. The answer's too obvious.

647
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,100
Vera may have been groping Shayla before,

648
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:57,640
but he's graduated to rape.

650
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:04,530
Just like Shayla, he's left me no choice.

651
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:07,470
He can't be allowed to exist anymore.

652
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,450
Perhaps we should start with how you're feeling.

653
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,880
Not good.

654
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,100
What's not good right now?

655
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:35,560
Everything.

656
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:39,880
Humor me with some specifics.

657
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:48,380
How do we know if we're in control?

658
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:54,060
That we're not just making the best

659
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:56,300
of what comes at us, and that's it.

660
00:35:57,030 --> 00:36:00,520
Trying to constantly pick between two options.

661
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:03,340
Like your two paintings in the waiting room.

662
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:08,520
Or...Coke and Pepsi.

663
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,830
McDonald's or Burger King?

664
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,680
Hyundai or Honda?

666
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,640
It's all part of the same blur, right?

668
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,970
Just out of focus enough.

670
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,100
It's the illusion of choice.

672
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:33,980
Half of us can't even pick our own--

674
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:36,910
our cable, gas, electric.

676
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:41,240
The water we drink, our health insurance.

677
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,630
Even if we did, would it matter?

678
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:48,400
You know, if our only option is Blue Cross or Blue Shield,

679
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:50,820
what the f--- is the difference?

680
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:58,270
In fact, aren't they-- aren't they the same?

681
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,080
No, man...

682
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:06,220
our choices are prepaid for us,

683
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:08,160
long time ago.

684
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:12,860
I'm sorry you feel you have no control.

685
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:17,990
Thought I was doing something good.

686
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:24,160
I was a part of this... project.

687
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:28,830
Thought I was going to be a part of something special.

688
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:34,680
And now?

689
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:36,610
Now...

690
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:40,430
It turned out to be a mistake,

691
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:42,610
like everything else.

692
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:46,100
What's the point, right?

693
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:50,720
Might as well, just-- you do nothing.

694
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:53,350
Might as well do nothing.

695
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,190
You've brought up this issue before,

696
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:00,560
this issue of not feeling like you're in control.

697
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,610
Do you remember?

698
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:06,960
When we spoke about your father.

699
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:10,550
You talked about how he chose to do nothing

700
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:12,500
when he was battling his cancer.

701
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:16,540
You told him he could have fought the company that caused it.

702
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:18,510
He could have told people about it.

703
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,070
He could have sought better care than what he was getting.

704
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,530
Instead, he did nothing.

705
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:29,770
Maybe your father felt the same way as you do now.

706
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:33,870
After all, like you said, what's the point?

707
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,630
- It's different. - What's different

708
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:39,110
is you've found options, Elliot.

709
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:42,510
That's the power you have. That's the control you own.

710
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:45,380
You don't have to just take what life gives you.

711
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,000
Come on.

712
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:51,440
Tell me what is going on with you.

713
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,070
I cannot help you if you keep me in the dark.

714
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:55,100
Shut up!

715
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:00,080
Shut up!

716
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:04,790
You've got bags under your eyes.

717
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:06,780
You're yelling. You're jittery.

718
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,820
For the last month, I have seen you

719
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:11,750
slip into old patterns, old behaviors.

720
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:17,010
What is going on?

725
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,880
He's still not answering.

726
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:21,620
Well, we'll just have to ask him tomorrow.

727
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:24,380
Every time I try to play it or rip it,

728
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:27,900
it just freezes up my computer and spits it back out again.

729
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:30,290
He's not okay.

730
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:33,130
He was acting so out of it at work today.

734
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:46,230
Are you saying something, babe?

735
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,470
Something's wrong.

736
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:49,440
Should I go over there?

737
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,450
And just...

738
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:53,270
Check in on him?

739
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:56,420
Uh...come on.

740
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:58,220
That's ridiculous.

741
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,920
You know he's always been a weirdo, right?

742
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,680
I'm really worried about him.

743
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:10,110
My Arizona buddy Fred hit me up.

744
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:12,600
He wants to grab a drink.

745
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,780
Shouldn't take too long.

746
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:17,790
Okay.

748
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:33,120
"Deep passions, longing...

749
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:35,540
the two of them had never felt such a love,

750
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,800
such closeness, such a connection."

751
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,040
Found a way to do it without--

752
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:44,420
Sit down.

753
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:56,510
I know how to take out the backups

754
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:58,040
without blowing up the pipeline.

755
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,980
You know, Elliot, I really feel like we resolved

756
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:02,550
this thing between us. Didn't you walk away?

757
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:03,730
I did. 

758
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:05,430
Didn't I say that if you walked away,

759
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:06,900
you were no longer a part of this?

760
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,260
I have a real plan--

761
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:12,320
If you want me to let you back in,

762
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,270
there's an understanding we have to come to,

763
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,240
a debt you have to pay,

764
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,230
because, remember, you walked away.

765
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:19,810
I thought you didn't believe in debts.

766
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:22,270
Not true. I believe in debts.

767
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,810
I believe in erasing them.

768
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:29,550
What do you want?

769
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:35,310
I want you to tell me about your father.

770
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:38,640
You're not gonna get into my head, man.

771
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,740
Your David Koresh shit isn't gonna work on me.

772
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:42,070
Tell me how he died.

773
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,670
Why, man? Something tells me

774
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:46,440
you already looked that shit up anyway.

775
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:47,680
I wanna hear it from you.

776
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:56,680
So I do this...

777
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:59,090
we go back to the arcade,

778
00:43:59,090 --> 00:44:00,930
discuss the plan with the rest of them?

779
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:17,260
I don't know what you want me to say.

780
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:20,600
We were close. Very close.

781
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,900
He was my best friend.

782
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:25,070
Worked at Evil Corp his whole life.

783
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,930
He was one of the best computer engineers they had.

784
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:31,890
And out of the blue, he got fired.

785
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:32,980
No one knew why.

786
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:35,670
Then one day he told me.

787
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:38,630
He had leukemia.

788
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:41,750
Made me swear to never tell anyone,

789
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:43,200
especially my mom.

790
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:45,570
So I didn't.

791
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:47,760
A few months go by...

792
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,030
he got sicker and sicker.

793
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:52,920
Finally, I got so worried...

794
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:56,170
told my mom.

795
00:44:57,370 --> 00:44:59,880
When he found out, he got pissed.

796
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:01,680
Started yelling.

797
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:06,040
I remember I tried to hug him, tell him I'm sorry, and...

798
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,350
kept shoving me away and shoved me so hard

799
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:11,610
I fell backwards out the window.

800
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,520
I fell, and I broke my arm.

801
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,560
Never spoke to me after that.

802
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:19,100
Couldn't even look at me.

803
00:45:19,930 --> 00:45:21,240
Even the night he died.

804
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:26,480
We good?

805
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:44,490
I understand what it's like to lose a parent.

806
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:46,130
It's heartbreaking.

807
00:45:50,270 --> 00:45:51,600
Did you ever think he was right?

808
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:55,260
About what?

809
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,210
Hurting you that day?

810
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,290
For what you did to him?

811
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:02,050
You ever think you deserved it?

812
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:04,210
I didn't do anything to him.

813
00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:05,630
I was trying to help him.

814
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:07,100
For betraying his trust.

815
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:09,430
I was eight years ol--

816
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:17,710
You didn't commit to the sacred pact you'd formed.
