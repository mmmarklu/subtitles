- Hi.

I'm Maxine.

How do you do?

Good. [ Chuckles ]

611
00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:26,530
I wasn't sure
I was going to come...

612
00:45:26,610 --> 00:45:30,170

[ Lotte ]
You're so beautiful.

I must say,
I was intrigued by your voice.

And the funny thing is, Mr. Malkovich...

620
00:45:52,930 --> 00:45:56,610
my voice is probably
the least intriguing thing about me.

So, I mean-- So, how was it?
What was he doing?

624
00:46:04,290 --> 00:46:06,730
He wasn't doing anything really.

625
00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:09,610
He was just hanging
around his apartment.

626
00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:13,450
I think he's probably just a really...
uh, lonely guy.

See, men can feel
unfulfilled, too, Lotte.

I'm glad you're coming
to realize that.

629
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:20,450
You shouldn't be so quick to assume
that switching bodies...

to your problems.

You're right, Craig.
You're right.

You know what I was thinking?
I was thinking that maybe...

we should invite Maxine
over for dinner one night...

634

a really nice gesture.

- I think she'd like that. What?
- Maxine?

636

some tension between us at work--

and I would hate to expose you to that.

It'll be okay.

641
00:46:56,730 --> 00:47:01,450
Now, when you say that I can be
somebody else, what do you mean exactly?

642
00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:04,930
Well, we mean exactly that.

643

We can put you inside
someone else's body for 1 5 minutes.

Can I be anybody that I wanna be?

- You can be John Malkovich.

No, that's what I'm saying. See, I don't
really need an extra bath mat.

659
00:48:08,810 --> 00:48:11,730
So if I get the set,
would it be possible...

Yes, sir. Sure, we can do that.

The thing is,
the way that I see it...
