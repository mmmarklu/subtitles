行在沃思堡市
The main branch is in Fort Worth.

852

They hit the one in Archer City.

855
01:04:40,374 --> 01:04:43,335
@Y有一家 - 他未劫
- Then there's the one here.
- Which they did not hit.

856
01:04:44,962 --> 01:04:49,049

@有一家...
There's the one here...

860
01:04:57,432 --> 01:04:59,309
柴德Y斯有一家

Alberto.

865
01:05:12,489 --> 01:05:13,991

866
01:05:14,157 --> 01:05:16,576
茴D那家PT了
Jayton is closed.

867

That just leaves Post.

868
01:05:18,412 --> 01:05:19,955
他不去搞柴德Y斯的分行
They're not gonna mess
with the bank in Childress.

Then he ran all the way
across the road to get to the car.

873
01:05:32,009 --> 01:05:34,219

I think his partner had no idea
that was gonna happen.

874
01:05:34,386 --> 01:05:35,470

It means that the only branch
that fits the bill is in Post.
