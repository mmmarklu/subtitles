1
00:02:15,345 --> 00:02:16,346
Quiet.

2
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:19,015
Open the door,
open the door.

3
00:02:20,266 --> 00:02:21,559
What?

4
00:02:25,271 --> 00:02:27,273
What in the devil?

5
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,359
Can you please stand up
and take us to the cash drawer, ma'am?

6
00:02:29,525 --> 00:02:32,612
- I will not.
- We ain't asking.

7
00:02:32,779 --> 00:02:34,405
There's no money
in the drawers yet.

8
00:02:34,572 --> 00:02:36,658
It's in the safe
and I ain't got the code.

9
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:38,493
Prove it.

10
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,078
Drawer!

11
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:41,829
Here.

12
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:43,331
Open the drawer.

13
00:02:43,498 --> 00:02:45,375
- I need the keys.
- Keys.

14
00:02:52,882 --> 00:02:54,217
Step back.

15
00:02:55,593 --> 00:02:58,096
Shit. Damn it!

16
00:02:58,262 --> 00:03:00,640
Y'all are new at this,
I'm guessing.

17
00:03:00,807 --> 00:03:03,267
- Where's the money?
- I told you, it's in the safe.

18
00:03:03,434 --> 00:03:06,187
- Well, who has the code?
- Mr. Clauson.

19
00:03:06,354 --> 00:03:09,440
He'll be here soon
and I suggest you fellers don't be.

20
00:03:09,607 --> 00:03:12,235
All you're guilty of right now
is being stupid.

21
00:03:12,402 --> 00:03:14,404
Just leave and that's all it'll be.

22
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,826
Tell me I'm stupid again.

23
00:03:23,955 --> 00:03:25,915
What time does Mr. Clauson get here?
Ma'am, look at me.

24
00:03:26,082 --> 00:03:28,000
What time does
Mr. Clauson get here, huh?

25
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:29,711
8:30 every morning.

26
00:03:32,422 --> 00:03:33,923
We're walking.

27
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:38,636
And sit.

28
00:03:38,803 --> 00:03:40,763
Where do you think you're going?
Sit on the floor!

29
00:03:57,238 --> 00:03:58,823
You're stupid.

30
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,126
This ain't about you, darling.

31
00:04:17,498 --> 00:04:18,916
Elsie, you all right?

32
00:04:22,545 --> 00:04:24,088
Good morning.

33
00:04:34,681 --> 00:04:36,308
You didn't have to hit him.

34
00:04:43,732 --> 00:04:45,234
- Slow down.
- I ain't speeding.

35
00:04:48,945 --> 00:04:51,114
See, little brother,
not a worry in the world.

36
00:04:52,115 --> 00:04:54,075
Planning this and doing it
is two different things.

37
00:04:55,201 --> 00:04:58,121
Maybe we should get there ahead,
get up to Olney.

38
00:04:59,956 --> 00:05:02,375
Early bird gets the worm.

39
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:10,087
- Slow down.
- I ain't speeding.

40
00:05:32,229 --> 00:05:34,272
I found these coins
in the barn.

41
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:36,650
Lord knows how long
they've been sitting there.

42
00:05:36,817 --> 00:05:40,404
I've been living off an inmate's diet,
and had all these coins

43
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:43,281
sitting right underneath
a bunch of feed sacks.

44
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:48,703
- This one says 1953.
-1953?

45
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,831
I wonder if any of these
is collector's items.

46
00:05:50,997 --> 00:05:53,208
You could be sitting
on a fortune here.

47
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:54,626
I hope so.

48
00:05:54,793 --> 00:05:56,503
Good morning, folks.
Open the drawer!

49
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:58,880
Open the motherfucking drawer!

50
00:05:59,047 --> 00:06:01,633
Ones, fives, 10s, 20s,
no hundreds, no bundles.

51
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,094
- You boys robbing the bank?
- Shut up.

52
00:06:04,261 --> 00:06:05,762
Put your hands on the counter.
On the counter.

53
00:06:05,929 --> 00:06:07,848
- Yes, sir.
- That's it, come on.

54
00:06:08,014 --> 00:06:11,143
That's crazy.
Y'all ain't even Mexicans.

55
00:06:11,309 --> 00:06:12,853
Uh-uh, uh-uh.
No bundles.

56
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:14,521
Just loose cash.

57
00:06:14,688 --> 00:06:15,856
Okay-

58
00:06:16,022 --> 00:06:17,524
You ought to be
ashamed of yourselves.

59
00:06:17,691 --> 00:06:19,067
Hands on the counter
where I can see them!

60
00:06:19,234 --> 00:06:20,777
Yes, sir.

61
00:06:20,944 --> 00:06:22,487
You got a gun on you, old man?

62
00:06:22,654 --> 00:06:25,282
You're damn right
I got a gun on me.

63
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:26,616
- Are you gonna get his gun?
- Yeah.

64
00:06:26,783 --> 00:06:28,410
Keep up with
the circumstances, okay?

65
00:06:28,577 --> 00:06:31,455
- Yeah, I got it.
- So are y'all gonna steal my gun, too?

66
00:06:31,621 --> 00:06:33,165
I have my own gun.

67
00:06:33,331 --> 00:06:35,500
We ain't stealing from you.
We're stealing from the bank.

68
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:38,462
Much obliged.

69
00:06:40,755 --> 00:06:42,048
Let's go!

70
00:06:42,215 --> 00:06:43,800
Sorry about this, folks.

71
00:06:45,469 --> 00:06:47,429
Dirty, rotten sons of bitches.

72
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,308
Fuck you, old man!

73
00:06:51,475 --> 00:06:53,101
Go, run, go!

74
00:07:09,993 --> 00:07:12,204
Put the gun on the counter?
You trying to get us killed?

75
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:13,413
I ain't stealing
from some old man.

76
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,624
We're stealing
from one place, that's it.

77
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,459
You're turning out to be
a poor-ass criminal.

78
00:07:17,626 --> 00:07:18,877
Oh, fuck you.

79
00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:23,131
Whoo!

80
00:07:23,298 --> 00:07:25,800
See what the early bird gets?

81
00:07:27,302 --> 00:07:28,970
Maybe we should hit
that branch in Jayton?

82
00:07:29,137 --> 00:07:30,305
No, we ain't.
We hit those banks

83
00:07:30,472 --> 00:07:32,557
first thing in the fucking morning,
when they're empty.

84
00:07:32,724 --> 00:07:35,519
- When they're empty, God damn it!
- All right.

85
00:07:35,685 --> 00:07:37,354
It's the last time
I care to be shot at.

86
00:07:39,231 --> 00:07:41,441
We got to be smart.
We're a ways from being finished.

87
00:07:41,608 --> 00:07:43,360
Shit, I can do this all week.

88
00:07:43,527 --> 00:07:44,528
We're gonna.

89
00:07:44,694 --> 00:07:47,447
We're like the Comanches,
little brother,

90
00:07:47,614 --> 00:07:49,324
raiding wherever we please

91
00:07:49,491 --> 00:07:52,410
with the whole of Texas
hunting our shadow.

92
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,205
Lord of the Plains.

93
00:07:58,375 --> 00:07:59,960
- Hands off.
- Fuck off!

94
00:09:40,435 --> 00:09:42,187
<i>You hear about these bank robberies?</i>

95
00:09:45,482 --> 00:09:47,275
Why are you always
dressed like me?

96
00:09:48,985 --> 00:09:50,445
This is our uniform.

97
00:09:50,612 --> 00:09:52,197
We ain't got no uniform.

98
00:09:52,364 --> 00:09:54,282
You can wear whatever
color shirt you choose.

99
00:09:54,449 --> 00:09:56,034
You just keep choosing mine.

100
00:09:56,201 --> 00:09:58,662
Ranger regs say white,
blue, or tan dress shirts.

101
00:09:58,828 --> 00:10:01,956
Stands to reason every once in a while
we're gonna be dressed the same.

102
00:10:02,123 --> 00:10:05,460
Well, you know what they say
about imitation, Alberto.

103
00:10:06,753 --> 00:10:08,296
You wanna hear
about these bank robberies,

104
00:10:08,463 --> 00:10:10,423
or you'll just sit there
and let Alzheimer's run its course?

105
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:12,133
Where are they at?

106
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,718
Texas Midlands--

107
00:10:13,885 --> 00:10:16,471
the branch in Archer City
and the branch in Olney.

108
00:10:16,638 --> 00:10:18,014
FBI want an assist?

109
00:10:18,181 --> 00:10:20,725
Midlands ain't got
any branches outside Texas.

110
00:10:20,892 --> 00:10:23,520
Plus, they're just hitting the drawers
for a few thousand.

111
00:10:23,687 --> 00:10:25,105
FBI don't want it.

112
00:10:28,483 --> 00:10:29,567
You may get to have some fun

113
00:10:29,734 --> 00:10:31,945
before they send you off
to the rocking chair yet.

114
00:10:52,298 --> 00:10:54,300
I need you sober.

115
00:10:54,467 --> 00:10:55,927
Who the hell gets drunk
off a beer?

116
00:11:01,391 --> 00:11:03,143
Place looks like shit.

117
00:11:03,309 --> 00:11:04,811
You got anything else
you wanna say?

118
00:11:04,978 --> 00:11:07,063
There's not a decent steak

119
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:09,691
in the whole lot
of them sorry sons of bitches.

120
00:11:09,858 --> 00:11:11,651
Yeah, well,
while you were busy in jail,

121
00:11:11,818 --> 00:11:12,819
I was busy looking after Mama,

122
00:11:12,986 --> 00:11:14,362
so you can go fuck yourself.

123
00:11:25,749 --> 00:11:27,250
Was she in that bed awhile?

124
00:11:31,254 --> 00:11:32,297
Three months.

125
00:11:48,313 --> 00:11:50,023
The end there was pretty rough.

126
00:11:53,651 --> 00:11:55,862
I could've helped out a little
if she asked.

127
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,699
I could've fed
them skinny cows.

128
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:04,579
We had nothing to feed them.

129
00:12:04,746 --> 00:12:07,081
Well, I could've helped clean up
the house a bit.

130
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,837
Never took you for the go-to guy
for house cleaning.

131
00:12:13,004 --> 00:12:16,132
No. Just robbing banks.

132
00:12:16,299 --> 00:12:17,550
You know.

133
00:12:31,022 --> 00:12:32,023
Fuck her.

134
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:34,275
She never wanted nothing
to do with me anyway.

135
00:12:44,619 --> 00:12:45,745
She leave a will?

136
00:12:49,207 --> 00:12:50,250
Yeah.

137
00:12:51,709 --> 00:12:52,919
Am I in it?

138
00:12:59,634 --> 00:13:00,802
The will don't matter.

139
00:13:02,929 --> 00:13:06,057
She left everything to me.
By Friday it all goes to my boys.

140
00:13:09,978 --> 00:13:11,312
She didn't mean nothing by it.

141
00:13:12,647 --> 00:13:14,315
She damn sure meant it.

142
00:13:14,482 --> 00:13:17,318
She always hated me
for standing up to him.

143
00:13:17,485 --> 00:13:19,195
<i>We all got punished.</i>

144
00:13:19,362 --> 00:13:23,116
You never understood that fighting back
makes the beating last longer.

145
00:13:23,283 --> 00:13:25,285
No, I understood.

146
00:13:25,451 --> 00:13:28,121
That's why I stopped fighting
and shot that son of a bitch.

147
00:14:33,645 --> 00:14:36,773
Hey, What's going on?

148
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,566
Somebody robbed
the bank this morning.

149
00:14:38,733 --> 00:14:39,776
Do what?

150
00:14:39,943 --> 00:14:41,861
If you see anyone
looking a little sideways,

151
00:14:42,028 --> 00:14:43,321
give me a call.

152
00:14:43,488 --> 00:14:45,156
Sideways don't wanna meet me.

153
00:14:45,323 --> 00:14:47,659
Find itself on the wrong end
of a short rope.

154
00:14:47,825 --> 00:14:51,746
Oh, well, that would simplify things
for everyone but you.

155
00:14:51,913 --> 00:14:55,124
Maybe,
if you can find the tree.

156
00:14:58,294 --> 00:15:01,005
God, I love West Texas.

157
00:15:04,634 --> 00:15:06,594
- Ranger.
- Hi there.

158
00:15:06,761 --> 00:15:08,638
Wasn't much of a robbery.

159
00:15:08,805 --> 00:15:10,723
Got off with just under $7,000.

160
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:14,769
Took the drawer money,
20s and under, only loose bills.

161
00:15:14,936 --> 00:15:16,479
- No ink pack?
- Nope.

162
00:15:16,646 --> 00:15:18,314
- Smart.
- That was smart.

163
00:15:18,481 --> 00:15:20,400
Can we get a look
at the video?

164
00:15:20,566 --> 00:15:23,569
Let me introduce you
to the bank manager, Mr. Clauson.

165
00:15:26,364 --> 00:15:28,116
This here is Ranger Hamilton.

166
00:15:28,282 --> 00:15:29,575
- Ranger.
- Sir.

167
00:15:29,742 --> 00:15:32,495
Can we get a look
at the surveillance video?

168
00:15:32,662 --> 00:15:35,873
We got cameras, but they're
switching us over to a digital system

169
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,291
that feeds into the computer.

170
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:40,128
These new cameras
don't hook to our VCRs.

171
00:15:40,294 --> 00:15:42,088
Call over
the Young County Sheriffs.

172
00:15:42,255 --> 00:15:44,298
Ask them if they thought
to hook their cameras

173
00:15:44,465 --> 00:15:46,592
to some sort of
recording device.

174
00:15:48,886 --> 00:15:51,055
- Armed?
- Yes, sir. Pistols.

175
00:15:51,222 --> 00:15:52,348
Oh.

176
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,809
Faces covered?

177
00:15:54,976 --> 00:15:57,854
Ski masks, sweatshirts,
baggy pants...

178
00:15:58,021 --> 00:15:59,564
- Uh-huh.
- Like them thugs in Dallas.

179
00:15:59,731 --> 00:16:01,149
Tweakers, maybe?

180
00:16:01,315 --> 00:16:02,400
Maybe.

181
00:16:02,567 --> 00:16:05,403
A little early in the morning
for tweakers.

182
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:08,531
Tweakers don't sleep.
They just tweak.

183
00:16:08,698 --> 00:16:12,118
They rob drug stores
and parked cars, not banks.

184
00:16:12,285 --> 00:16:13,494
Can I take a look inside?

185
00:16:13,661 --> 00:16:14,871
Yes, sir.

186
00:16:15,038 --> 00:16:16,539
Yeah, I'm here, Margaret.

187
00:16:16,706 --> 00:16:18,666
So they bopped you
in the snozzola, huh?

188
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,793
Yes, sir.

189
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,253
Not very nice.

190
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:28,176
I know their faces was covered,
but could you tell their race?

191
00:16:28,342 --> 00:16:30,428
Black, white?

192
00:16:30,595 --> 00:16:33,222
Their skin or their souls?

193
00:16:33,389 --> 00:16:36,476
Let's leave their souls
out of this for now.

194
00:16:36,642 --> 00:16:38,269
White.

195
00:16:38,436 --> 00:16:41,647
From around here somewhere
is my guess,

196
00:16:41,814 --> 00:16:43,566
you know, from their voices.

197
00:16:43,733 --> 00:16:44,984
Oh?

198
00:16:45,151 --> 00:16:47,403
<i>Young County says same deal
with the branch in Olney.</i>

199
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:48,696
Excuse me.

200
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,908
Do they have video?

201
00:16:52,075 --> 00:16:53,493
Same deal all the way around.

202
00:16:54,744 --> 00:16:58,164
Doesn't Walmart sell all sorts
of electronic equipment?

203
00:16:58,331 --> 00:17:00,291
My word.
Get your hands off that.

204
00:17:01,751 --> 00:17:06,422
Well, these boys, they aren't done yet,
I'll tell you that.

205
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:08,341
- How come?
- Well, they're patient.

206
00:17:08,508 --> 00:17:12,220
They're just sticking to the drawers,
not taking the hundreds.

207
00:17:12,386 --> 00:17:14,680
That's the bank's money.
We can trace that.

208
00:17:14,847 --> 00:17:17,225
They're trying to raise
a certain amount.

209
00:17:17,391 --> 00:17:18,434
That's my guess.

210
00:17:18,601 --> 00:17:21,521
It's gonna take
a few banks to get there.

211
00:17:34,867 --> 00:17:36,452
Your boys know how rich
they're gonna be?

212
00:17:39,497 --> 00:17:40,915
They don't know anything yet.

213
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,460
You take them to the funeral?

214
00:17:47,088 --> 00:17:48,923
Like I said,
they don't know anything.

215
00:17:52,718 --> 00:17:54,303
When's the last time
you saw them?

216
00:17:58,891 --> 00:18:01,561
When we all went to the rodeo
in Stamford right after you got out.

217
00:18:04,063 --> 00:18:06,941
- That was a year ago.
- I talk to them on the phone.

218
00:18:07,108 --> 00:18:08,693
You talk to them on the phone?

219
00:18:12,155 --> 00:18:14,907
- You want a little advice?
- No. No, I don't.

220
00:18:15,074 --> 00:18:16,200
Go see them tomorrow.

221
00:18:20,037 --> 00:18:22,957
You got any idea how much
I owe Debbie in child support?

222
00:18:23,124 --> 00:18:25,835
You've got enough in your front pocket
to fix that problem right now.

223
00:18:28,254 --> 00:18:29,881
We can't spare it,
you know that.

224
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,092
Maybe we should hit
another branch.

225
00:18:37,763 --> 00:18:41,100
You know, you talk like
we ain't gonna get away with this.

226
00:18:41,267 --> 00:18:45,062
I've never met nobody who got away
with anything, ever.

227
00:18:45,229 --> 00:18:46,480
You?

228
00:18:50,484 --> 00:18:52,361
Then why in the hell
did you agree to do it?

229
00:18:53,988 --> 00:18:55,489
Because you asked,
little brother.

230
00:19:03,456 --> 00:19:05,166
I got to shit like an old goat.

231
00:19:06,584 --> 00:19:08,211
Grab the check,
meet me out front.

232
00:19:15,968 --> 00:19:18,679
Well, if that isn't a hint,
I don't know what is.

233
00:19:23,309 --> 00:19:25,853
- You like your steak?
- Yes, ma'am.

234
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,939
Well, you've got
a ways to go yet.

235
00:19:29,148 --> 00:19:32,443
Yeah, you'll be waiting around all day
for me to finish this.

236
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:36,155
I'll be here whether
you finish it or not, so...

237
00:19:36,322 --> 00:19:37,698
you take your time.

238
00:19:46,249 --> 00:19:47,541
Sure is quiet in here.

239
00:19:48,626 --> 00:19:51,379
Open the drawer.
Fives, 10s, 20s.

240
00:19:51,545 --> 00:19:53,256
Fan them out
like a deck of cards.

241
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,259
What do you do?

242
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,683
Last job was for a...

243
00:20:03,849 --> 00:20:05,726
natural gas company.

244
00:20:07,186 --> 00:20:08,271
Sounds high-dollar.

245
00:20:09,689 --> 00:20:12,525
No, there ain't nothing
high-dollar about drilling.

246
00:20:12,692 --> 00:20:14,819
No one seems to be
drilling for gas now, anyway.

247
00:20:14,986 --> 00:20:17,363
They're sure drilling for oil.

248
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:19,573
I mean, ain't one drill
the same as the next?

249
00:20:22,076 --> 00:20:23,577
That's my take on it.

250
00:20:24,704 --> 00:20:26,414
Guess I got to get
someone else to believe me.

251
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,457
<i>Son of a bitch!</i>

252
00:20:30,293 --> 00:20:31,836
We could use a cook.

253
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,467
Just a thought.

254
00:20:39,802 --> 00:20:41,595
<i>Order's up, Jenny Ann.</i>

255
00:20:47,435 --> 00:20:48,477
Bye.

256
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:11,792
Start the car!

257
00:21:11,959 --> 00:21:13,127
Shit!

258
00:21:18,674 --> 00:21:20,426
Fuck! Shit!

259
00:21:20,593 --> 00:21:21,886
Go, go, go!

260
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,864
I bet you don't owe this much
in child support.

261
00:21:42,907 --> 00:21:44,784
I must be out of my goddamn mind
to ask you for help.

262
00:21:46,702 --> 00:21:49,538
You wanna get us killed?!
Huh?!

263
00:21:49,705 --> 00:21:52,583
That's not a Midlands Branch.
That's not part of the plan.

264
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,585
Now, we got to go back to the ranch
and bury the car.

265
00:21:54,752 --> 00:21:55,920
- Fuck!
- No, we do not.

266
00:21:56,087 --> 00:21:57,421
We're over halfway to Oklahoma.

267
00:21:57,588 --> 00:22:01,675
I'm not driving a stolen getaway car
to a fucking Indian casino.

268
00:22:01,842 --> 00:22:03,219
You just put us
a goddamn day behind.

269
00:22:03,386 --> 00:22:06,305
Well, I got us a day ahead
this morning, so I guess we're even.

270
00:22:06,472 --> 00:22:08,099
- You're welcome.
- Fuck you.

271
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,485
Can't you answer
your own phone?

272
00:22:19,652 --> 00:22:22,780
I'm driving. You're just sitting there
twiddling your fat fingers.

273
00:22:24,448 --> 00:22:26,033
Ranger Hamilton's phone.

274
00:23:09,285 --> 00:23:10,870
It's reckless is what it is.

275
00:23:11,036 --> 00:23:12,121
It's tweakers, I'm telling you.

276
00:23:12,288 --> 00:23:13,956
I don't think these boys
is reckless.

277
00:23:14,123 --> 00:23:16,208
Damn sure ain't tweakers.

278
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:18,377
They know exactly
what they're doing.

279
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:23,382
I don't know how you're gonna survive
without somebody to outsmart.

280
00:23:24,633 --> 00:23:26,802
You need a hobby, and quick.

281
00:23:27,845 --> 00:23:29,013
How about a horse?

282
00:23:30,431 --> 00:23:32,516
Mary Beth was the rider.

283
00:23:34,185 --> 00:23:36,187
A horse would only
remind me of her.

284
00:23:38,314 --> 00:23:39,482
You like to fish.

285
00:23:41,734 --> 00:23:44,195
Not enough to do it
every goddamn day.

286
00:23:45,613 --> 00:23:47,448
Yeah, when I retire,

287
00:23:47,615 --> 00:23:50,659
I'm gonna move Esme and me
down to Galveston.

288
00:23:50,826 --> 00:23:52,119
Buy a fishing boat.

289
00:23:52,286 --> 00:23:54,955
Gonna live on that son of a bitch
right at the pier.

290
00:23:55,122 --> 00:23:57,833
Oh, who knows?

291
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,462
Maybe one of these bank robbers
is gonna want a gunfight

292
00:24:01,629 --> 00:24:05,466
and I can dodge my retirement
in a blaze of glory.

293
00:24:05,633 --> 00:24:07,510
Well, I've seen you shoot.

294
00:24:07,676 --> 00:24:09,261
There won't be much glory in it.

295
00:24:11,222 --> 00:24:13,224
Oh, well, I'm lucky

296
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:16,393
I got a half-breed by my side
to avenge me.

297
00:24:17,561 --> 00:24:20,272
If you can stay sober
long enough,

298
00:24:20,439 --> 00:24:23,192
knowing how you lnjuns
like the bottle.

299
00:24:30,407 --> 00:24:32,201
Whoa.

300
00:24:40,543 --> 00:24:42,336
Hey!

301
00:24:42,503 --> 00:24:44,505
What you all doing?
You burning this field?

302
00:24:44,672 --> 00:24:46,090
Why in the shit
would we do that?

303
00:24:46,257 --> 00:24:48,842
This kicked up on the highway,
been chasing us ever since.

304
00:24:49,009 --> 00:24:51,136
Wish we could do
something for you.

305
00:24:51,303 --> 00:24:53,347
Ought to just let it turn me to ashes,
put me out of my misery.

306
00:24:53,514 --> 00:24:55,307
Cut that fence.

307
00:24:55,474 --> 00:24:59,061
21st century, I'm racing a fire
to the river with a herd of cattle.

308
00:24:59,228 --> 00:25:01,939
And I wonder why my kids
won't do this shit for a living.

309
00:25:02,106 --> 00:25:04,066
Move 'em out.
Come on.

310
00:25:04,233 --> 00:25:05,609
Go, go! go-

311
00:25:08,612 --> 00:25:10,573
You wanna call it in?

312
00:25:10,739 --> 00:25:13,409
Oh, it's gonna burn out
when it hits the Brazos.

313
00:25:14,702 --> 00:25:17,621
No one to call
around here, anyway.

314
00:25:17,788 --> 00:25:19,915
No, these boys is on their own.

315
00:25:29,341 --> 00:25:30,426
I still don't see the problem, Toby.

316
00:25:30,593 --> 00:25:31,594
You still don't...

317
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,886
Well, the problem is,
thanks to you,

318
00:25:33,053 --> 00:25:34,763
we have to spend tomorrow morning
getting another car,

319
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:36,724
so we'll have to hit two banks
on Wednesday.

320
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:38,851
We already done three today.

321
00:25:39,018 --> 00:25:40,561
Stop worrying.

322
00:25:43,689 --> 00:25:44,815
Whose land is this?

323
00:25:47,401 --> 00:25:48,736
Jeremy Chalker.

324
00:25:50,321 --> 00:25:52,740
He lets me stay here in exchange
for shooting coyotes.

325
00:25:58,245 --> 00:25:59,496
Cold beer in the fridge.

326
00:26:17,681 --> 00:26:18,724
You stole my hat.

327
00:26:18,891 --> 00:26:20,100
I borrowed it.

328
00:26:20,267 --> 00:26:21,602
What the fuck you do to it?

329
00:26:35,741 --> 00:26:37,785
- What's this?
- My livelihood.

330
00:26:39,578 --> 00:26:40,788
We don't need all this.

331
00:26:40,954 --> 00:26:43,582
Can't keep the guns
in the trailer days on end.

332
00:26:43,749 --> 00:26:45,167
That's not coming with us
in the bank.

333
00:26:49,338 --> 00:26:50,631
Just spoke to the teller.

334
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:51,965
She's a little shook up.

335
00:26:52,132 --> 00:26:53,300
Perp took her driver's license,

336
00:26:53,467 --> 00:26:55,260
threatened her family
if she talked to us.

337
00:26:57,721 --> 00:27:00,307
Mind if I ask you
your name, young lady?

338
00:27:00,474 --> 00:27:02,226
Natalie Martinez.

339
00:27:02,393 --> 00:27:04,812
Well, Natalie,
I want you to know

340
00:27:04,978 --> 00:27:07,940
we're gonna have some officers
watching your house extra careful

341
00:27:08,107 --> 00:27:09,358
till we catch these buggers.

342
00:27:09,525 --> 00:27:11,694
You have my word on that.

343
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,195
There's more than one?

344
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:16,407
Only one man robbed the bank?

345
00:27:16,573 --> 00:27:18,367
- Yeah.
- What'd he look like?

346
00:27:18,534 --> 00:27:22,788
He was dressed like a cowpoke
except for the ski mask.

347
00:27:23,956 --> 00:27:27,918
I think he ran to a car
that was parked out front of the diner.

348
00:27:28,085 --> 00:27:29,920
You saw the car?

349
00:27:30,087 --> 00:27:32,047
It was green.

350
00:27:32,214 --> 00:27:34,717
- How old?
- I don't know cars, mister.

351
00:27:34,883 --> 00:27:38,595
Well, was it a nice car,
an okay car,

352
00:27:38,762 --> 00:27:40,055
or a real piece of shit?

353
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,933
It was a real piece of shit.

354
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,394
All right.
Now, we're getting somewhere.

355
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:49,648
Oh, that looks like a man
who could foreclose on a house.

356
00:27:49,815 --> 00:27:51,233
Excuse me, Natalie.

357
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,985
Excuse me, Mr. Banker.

358
00:27:53,152 --> 00:27:55,696
Natalie, I'm gonna have the officer
stay with you till your father arrives.

359
00:27:55,863 --> 00:27:56,989
- All right?
- Okay.

360
00:27:57,156 --> 00:27:59,867
Didn't happen to have your surveillance
cameras on this morning, did you?

361
00:28:00,033 --> 00:28:01,118
Of course.

362
00:28:01,285 --> 00:28:03,203
Oh, so you have
the robbery on video.

363
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:04,413
Of course we do.

364
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:07,291
What kind of bank would we be
if we didn't have video surveillance?

365
00:28:07,458 --> 00:28:10,544
Oh, you'd be
a Texas Midlands Bank.

366
00:28:10,711 --> 00:28:12,504
All right, we've got video.

367
00:28:12,671 --> 00:28:15,799
Care to give it a watch
while I wander over to the burger joint?

368
00:28:15,966 --> 00:28:17,342
Would you order me something
while you're there?

369
00:28:17,509 --> 00:28:20,387
- I'm starving.
- I doubt they serve pemmican.

370
00:28:20,554 --> 00:28:22,473
You know
I'm part Mexican, too.

371
00:28:22,639 --> 00:28:24,391
Yeah, well,
I'm gonna get to that

372
00:28:24,558 --> 00:28:26,935
when I'm through
with the Indian insults,

373
00:28:27,102 --> 00:28:28,604
but it's gonna be a while.

374
00:28:31,023 --> 00:28:33,192
You rangers are an odd bunch.

375
00:28:33,358 --> 00:28:36,236
No, just him.

376
00:28:36,403 --> 00:28:37,654
Let's take a look at that video.

377
00:28:37,821 --> 00:28:39,615
Yeah, it's right back here.

378
00:28:49,875 --> 00:28:51,335
Howdy.

379
00:28:51,502 --> 00:28:52,711
Ma'am.

380
00:28:52,878 --> 00:28:55,422
Guess you know about
the goings-on at the bank.

381
00:28:55,589 --> 00:28:56,673
I did notice.

382
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,092
Any out-of-towners
come through today?

383
00:29:00,093 --> 00:29:03,514
Jenny Ann waited on a couple of boys,
ain't from here.

384
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,723
Oh?

385
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:06,475
I'll go get her.

386
00:29:06,642 --> 00:29:07,976
Appreciate that.

387
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,732
Boys.

388
00:29:13,899 --> 00:29:15,818
Y'all been here for a while?

389
00:29:15,984 --> 00:29:17,903
Well, long enough to watch
a bank getting robbed

390
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:21,114
that's been robbing me
for 30 years.

391
00:29:21,281 --> 00:29:22,699
Oh, you say you've seen them?

392
00:29:24,201 --> 00:29:27,996
I'm pretty sure they were sitting
right over there having lunch.

393
00:29:28,163 --> 00:29:29,832
One of them was tall.

394
00:29:29,998 --> 00:29:32,459
The other one was short.

395
00:29:34,086 --> 00:29:36,213
They's both lean like cowboys.

396
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:38,882
Looked like brothers
if you ask me.

397
00:29:39,049 --> 00:29:40,968
You the Texas Ranger?

398
00:29:41,134 --> 00:29:43,011
Yes, ma'am.

399
00:29:43,178 --> 00:29:46,557
Tell me about those handsome
young strangers that you waited on.

400
00:29:48,308 --> 00:29:49,893
Who said handsome?

401
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:51,228
I did.

402
00:29:52,312 --> 00:29:54,898
Based on the fact that you didn't
meet me in the parking lot,

403
00:29:55,065 --> 00:29:56,692
hollering about
the two out-of-towners

404
00:29:56,859 --> 00:29:59,027
eating here
right before a bank robbery.

405
00:30:01,864 --> 00:30:03,615
Well, they didn't mention
they was robbing the bank.

406
00:30:03,782 --> 00:30:04,992
They paid cash?

407
00:30:06,243 --> 00:30:07,578
That a crime now?

408
00:30:10,956 --> 00:30:12,165
How much did they leave?

409
00:30:15,752 --> 00:30:16,795
How much?

410
00:30:17,963 --> 00:30:19,548
$200.

411
00:30:19,715 --> 00:30:23,427
And they left it before
the bank was robbed, so...

412
00:30:23,594 --> 00:30:26,013
Uh, before this bank
was robbed.

413
00:30:27,639 --> 00:30:29,308
I'm gonna need
to see them bills.

414
00:30:33,604 --> 00:30:35,355
- Ma'am.
- Mm-mm.

415
00:30:36,648 --> 00:30:39,234
Ma'am, them bills is evidence.

416
00:30:39,401 --> 00:30:41,778
Mm-mm, it's evidence
if they're the bank robbers.

417
00:30:41,945 --> 00:30:44,865
Till then, it's my tip.

418
00:30:45,032 --> 00:30:47,075
And half my mortgage.

419
00:30:47,242 --> 00:30:48,744
So, you go out there
and you get a warrant,

420
00:30:48,911 --> 00:30:49,912
and you come after the money

421
00:30:50,078 --> 00:30:52,956
that I will be using to keep a roof
over my daughter's head.

422
00:30:57,252 --> 00:31:00,547
One man hit the bank,
just like she said.

423
00:31:00,714 --> 00:31:02,299
- Yeah.
- Checkered button-down shirt,

424
00:31:02,466 --> 00:31:03,842
jeans, ski mask.

425
00:31:04,009 --> 00:31:05,218
- That's all the video will tell us.
- Yep. Yep.

426
00:31:05,385 --> 00:31:08,263
Checkered shirt.
That is him.

427
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:12,184
They were sitting right over there.
Tipped her $200.

428
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:16,605
Go wrestle a description

429
00:31:16,772 --> 00:31:19,149
from that big sassy girl
in the kitchen.

430
00:31:19,316 --> 00:31:20,400
You didn't get it yourself?

431
00:31:20,567 --> 00:31:24,154
Oh, and get that tip from her.
We're gonna check them bills.

432
00:31:24,321 --> 00:31:25,530
Good luck.

433
00:31:25,697 --> 00:31:28,492
Yeah, I'd expect some resistance.

434
00:31:28,659 --> 00:31:30,827
Oh, and, Alberto,

435
00:31:30,994 --> 00:31:35,374
call that motel on 287,
get us a room.

436
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:36,583
We're gonna stay the night?

437
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:38,293
Well, this is where the action is.

438
00:31:40,212 --> 00:31:41,546
Seems foolish.

439
00:31:41,713 --> 00:31:43,131
What's that?

440
00:31:43,298 --> 00:31:46,802
The days of robbing banks
and trying to live to spend the money...

441
00:31:48,387 --> 00:31:49,638
they're long gone.

442
00:31:50,639 --> 00:31:52,182
Long gone for sure.

443
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:02,818
What does Justin want to do
when he's grown?

444
00:32:05,362 --> 00:32:07,948
Right now he's dreaming
of slinging a football for A&M.

445
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:14,871
He's a lot like you.

446
00:32:15,038 --> 00:32:18,542
- I bet that puckers your red eye.
- More than you know.

447
00:32:21,044 --> 00:32:24,214
39 years of life, 10 in jail.

448
00:32:24,381 --> 00:32:27,426
If he turn left where I turned right,
he'll be okay.

449
00:32:34,516 --> 00:32:37,978
Let the world call me a fool

450
00:32:39,396 --> 00:32:42,691
Things are right with me and you

451
00:32:44,443 --> 00:32:45,444
Yaw.

452
00:32:47,571 --> 00:32:49,489
Yaw.

453
00:33:04,546 --> 00:33:05,756
You want anything?

454
00:33:05,922 --> 00:33:07,591
Dr Pepper, Winston Lights.

455
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,847
It's okay.
Come on.

456
00:33:25,901 --> 00:33:26,985
What?

457
00:33:29,154 --> 00:33:30,197
What, bitch?

458
00:33:32,574 --> 00:33:35,035
You looking for trouble,
motherfucker?

459
00:33:35,202 --> 00:33:37,120
You came to the right place.

460
00:33:37,287 --> 00:33:40,165
Boy, you'd think
there were 10 of me.

461
00:33:41,541 --> 00:33:42,584
Oh, yeah?

462
00:33:45,587 --> 00:33:48,256
Not so fucking tough now,
are you, bitch?

463
00:34:03,271 --> 00:34:04,397
Hey, man, he had it coming.

464
00:34:04,564 --> 00:34:06,066
He had it coming.
He had it coming.

465
00:34:12,072 --> 00:34:15,075
You got some spunk left in you.

466
00:34:16,493 --> 00:34:18,620
Oh, you remembered the gun.

467
00:34:18,787 --> 00:34:21,248
You're getting
to be old hat at this.

468
00:34:30,465 --> 00:34:32,467
Asshole could've killed you.

469
00:34:32,634 --> 00:34:35,137
Ah, not the way it would
have gone, little brother.

470
00:34:39,099 --> 00:34:42,018
10 of me, I told you!

471
00:34:43,937 --> 00:34:44,980
Are you trying to make me mad?

472
00:34:45,147 --> 00:34:47,065
I said Dr Pepper.
This is Mr. Pibb.

473
00:34:47,232 --> 00:34:48,233
That's all they had.

474
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,318
Only assholes drink Mr. Pibb.

475
00:34:50,485 --> 00:34:51,653
Drink up.

476
00:35:02,914 --> 00:35:03,957
Hello.

477
00:35:20,473 --> 00:35:21,683
No!

478
00:35:25,187 --> 00:35:26,313
Now we're talking.

479
00:35:28,481 --> 00:35:30,066
The women in this place.

480
00:35:32,611 --> 00:35:34,654
<i>What the hell you talking about?</i>

481
00:35:34,821 --> 00:35:36,740
We should get another shot.
They'll be pretty soon enough.

482
00:35:36,907 --> 00:35:39,367
Bartender,
whiskeys if you please.

483
00:35:39,534 --> 00:35:40,660
Coming UP-

484
00:35:45,207 --> 00:35:46,249
To your boys.

485
00:35:57,761 --> 00:35:59,012
Let's go change that money.

486
00:36:05,143 --> 00:36:07,229
Sorry.
I just sold my car.

487
00:36:07,395 --> 00:36:08,647
This is how the fella paid me.

488
00:36:08,813 --> 00:36:10,523
We take it any way
you bring it, mister.

489
00:36:23,536 --> 00:36:25,413
Wanna play some poker?

490
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:26,581
I don't gamble.

491
00:36:26,748 --> 00:36:28,500
You can't lose at poker,
not even you.

492
00:36:29,793 --> 00:36:31,920
I'm gonna watch the Aggie game
and have a beer.

493
00:36:32,087 --> 00:36:33,421
All right, suit yourself.

494
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:36,466
Come on, now.

495
00:36:36,633 --> 00:36:38,176
Suck a D.

496
00:36:38,343 --> 00:36:39,678
Don't lose it all.

497
00:36:39,844 --> 00:36:41,763
<i>Eat my A!</i>

498
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:43,640
Fucking asshole.

499
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:43,450
That's, uh--
that's quite a stack.

500
00:37:53,791 --> 00:37:54,958
Check?

501
00:37:55,125 --> 00:37:56,460
Don't chase me, chief.

502
00:38:09,881 --> 00:38:10,882
You Comanche?

503
00:38:14,928 --> 00:38:16,513
Lords of the Plains.

504
00:38:17,514 --> 00:38:19,099
Lords of Nothing now.

505
00:38:28,141 --> 00:38:29,351
I call.

506
00:38:31,812 --> 00:38:33,355
Show your cards, gentlemen.

507
00:38:46,451 --> 00:38:48,370
Do you know
what Comanche means?

508
00:38:51,123 --> 00:38:53,500
It means enemies forever.

509
00:38:53,667 --> 00:38:55,294
Enemies with who?

510
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,337
Everyone.

511
00:38:57,504 --> 00:38:59,256
You know what that makes me?

512
00:38:59,423 --> 00:39:00,424
An enemy.

513
00:39:00,591 --> 00:39:02,467
No.

514
00:39:02,634 --> 00:39:04,720
It makes me a Comanche.

515
00:39:14,349 --> 00:39:15,725
Does he look like you?

516
00:39:16,726 --> 00:39:17,936
I see his mom in him.

517
00:39:19,146 --> 00:39:20,730
Everybody else sees me.

518
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:23,233
I don't know.

519
00:39:28,405 --> 00:39:30,073
You staying in the hotel?

520
00:39:34,202 --> 00:39:35,245
Yeah.

521
00:39:37,414 --> 00:39:40,834
Take me to your room.

522
00:39:45,797 --> 00:39:47,132
Thank you.
Just, uh...

523
00:39:48,216 --> 00:39:51,803
There's no shame
in needing the touch of a woman.

524
00:39:54,806 --> 00:39:56,349
You need it.

525
00:39:57,434 --> 00:39:58,768
I know you do.

526
00:40:00,437 --> 00:40:02,647
Just let me touch you.

527
00:40:03,648 --> 00:40:05,650
Trying to work my little brother?

528
00:40:05,817 --> 00:40:07,611
- No, I wasn't doing anything, but I...
- Tanner, she didn't do nothin'.

529
00:40:07,777 --> 00:40:09,488
- She didn't do nothin'.
- But, but, but, but, but...

530
00:40:09,654 --> 00:40:11,448
You saw there was
a stack of chips here.

531
00:40:11,615 --> 00:40:12,657
- Don't.
- Easy mark?

532
00:40:12,824 --> 00:40:14,701
- Uh... no.
- What were you gonna do?

533
00:40:14,868 --> 00:40:16,828
Bring him up to his room,
call your pimp,

534
00:40:16,995 --> 00:40:18,038
-roll him, drug him, what?
- No. I...

535
00:40:18,205 --> 00:40:19,706
- What were you gonna do?
- Tanner, no.

536
00:40:19,873 --> 00:40:21,708
Mind if I sample the goods?
Real fuckin'...

537
00:40:21,875 --> 00:40:25,879
Hands off. Stop it.
Stop it.

538
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:33,303
- You're fucking crazy!
- Call me.

539
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:34,471
<i>We got a problem here?</i>

540
00:40:34,638 --> 00:40:36,264
- It's all good.
- It's all good.

541
00:40:36,431 --> 00:40:38,558
It's all good.
Just got a little drunk at the bar.

542
00:40:38,725 --> 00:40:39,893
Sorry about that.

543
00:40:43,355 --> 00:40:46,316
How the fuck have you managed
to stay out of prison for a year?

544
00:40:46,483 --> 00:40:47,734
It's been difficult.

545
00:40:52,614 --> 00:40:54,741
Like to pay this out
in cash or check?

546
00:40:54,908 --> 00:40:56,368
Get some Debbie money.

547
00:40:57,536 --> 00:41:00,080
Four in cash, rest in check.

548
00:41:01,623 --> 00:41:03,208
Who would you like
the check made out to?

549
00:41:05,293 --> 00:41:06,795
Texas Midlands Bank.

550
00:41:15,428 --> 00:41:16,513
Thank you much.

551
00:41:17,764 --> 00:41:19,266
Let's go get a room.

552
00:41:30,569 --> 00:41:33,113
Welcome to the Comanche 66.
Do you have a reservation?

553
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,864
We do not.

554
00:41:35,031 --> 00:41:38,410
Good Lord, look at you.

555
00:41:39,536 --> 00:41:41,913
We would be obliged if you
would provide accommodations,

556
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,165
though we failed to call ahead.

557
00:41:44,332 --> 00:41:46,334
Boy, you are trouble.

558
00:41:46,501 --> 00:41:47,669
I'm the worst kind, darling.

559
00:41:47,836 --> 00:41:52,716
In your last days in the nursing home,
you'll think of me and giggle.

560
00:41:57,846 --> 00:42:00,515
<i>Why, God?
Why won't you answer my prayers?</i>

561
00:42:00,682 --> 00:42:02,142
<i>You begged him for help,</i>

562
00:42:02,309 --> 00:42:04,728
<i>and yet you look around at your life
and nothing is different.</i>

563
00:42:04,894 --> 00:42:08,148
<i>And so you assume
that God has told you no.</i>

564
00:42:09,524 --> 00:42:12,110
God doesn't say no.

565
00:42:12,277 --> 00:42:14,487
Why couldn't we drive back
to Lubbock?

566
00:42:14,654 --> 00:42:16,823
'Cause they ain't robbing banks
in Lubbock.

567
00:42:17,824 --> 00:42:19,659
We're not gonna watch this,
are we?

568
00:42:21,786 --> 00:42:23,538
Ain't you Christian?

569
00:42:23,705 --> 00:42:25,248
Yeah, but I ain't stupid.

570
00:42:25,415 --> 00:42:28,460
God doesn't talk through this man
any more than he talks through my dog.

571
00:42:28,627 --> 00:42:31,338
Well, then maybe you should
give your dog a listen.

572
00:42:31,504 --> 00:42:32,589
Ain't you Indian?

573
00:42:32,756 --> 00:42:34,758
You're supposed to be
burning sage

574
00:42:34,924 --> 00:42:39,387
and dancing around the bed,
whooping like a bee stung you.

575
00:42:39,554 --> 00:42:41,514
I'm Catholic.

576
00:42:43,642 --> 00:42:44,643
Come on.

577
00:42:46,603 --> 00:42:50,273
Come on, I'd rather dance
around the fire with a spear.

578
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:53,276
I'd rather have you stab me
with a spear than watch this.

579
00:42:53,443 --> 00:42:55,445
This son of a bitch,
he wouldn't know God

580
00:42:55,612 --> 00:42:58,573
if he crawled up his pant leg
and bit him on the pecker.

581
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:00,075
Change the damn channel.

582
00:43:08,166 --> 00:43:10,794
Now, this, this is
what God watches right here.

583
00:43:14,881 --> 00:43:17,842
Don't worry, they're gonna have
soccer highlights on soon enough.

584
00:43:18,009 --> 00:43:19,678
That's for your Mexican half.

585
00:43:25,433 --> 00:43:27,352
Wow, look at this boy run.

586
00:43:28,353 --> 00:43:30,480
Longhorns are gonna have
a good team this year.

587
00:43:34,776 --> 00:43:37,904
That soccer,
never could understand that.

588
00:43:38,071 --> 00:43:41,282
Anything a 5-year-old can do
ain't a sport.

589
00:43:41,449 --> 00:43:44,869
Who invented it? Aztecs?

590
00:43:45,036 --> 00:43:47,330
Kickin' around skulls
or something, right?

591
00:43:48,832 --> 00:43:50,959
Sounds like a Comanche sport.

592
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:54,212
You know, in three weeks,

593
00:43:54,379 --> 00:43:57,632
you can watch whatever
you want on TV all day.

594
00:43:57,799 --> 00:44:00,218
Hell, you can do it right now
in your own room.

595
00:44:00,385 --> 00:44:02,470
Oh, where's the fun in that?

596
00:44:03,471 --> 00:44:05,473
You know what, Alberto?

597
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:07,642
What?

598
00:44:09,102 --> 00:44:10,687
In a year's time,

599
00:44:11,938 --> 00:44:14,399
it's my teasing
that you're gonna miss.

600
00:44:16,109 --> 00:44:17,402
It's what you'll laugh about

601
00:44:17,569 --> 00:44:20,572
when you stand over my grave
and wish me well.

602
00:44:20,739 --> 00:44:22,490
God, I hope that's tomorrow.

603
00:44:23,533 --> 00:44:24,909
Oh, that was a good one.

604
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:30,081
You'll get the hang of this yet.

605
00:44:36,504 --> 00:44:37,881
Isn't it getting late for you?

606
00:44:42,886 --> 00:44:43,887
Yeah.

607
00:44:48,808 --> 00:44:50,101
Yeah, it is.

608
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:08,286
Oh, heavens above.

609
00:45:08,453 --> 00:45:10,622
Heavens above.

610
00:45:10,789 --> 00:45:12,791
Look at those titties.
Are you fucking kidding me?

611
00:45:58,127 --> 00:45:59,170
<i>What are you doing?</i>

612
00:46:02,632 --> 00:46:05,552
Sleeping on the porch,
practicing my future.

613
00:46:11,474 --> 00:46:13,560
It's a dangerous thing
we do for a living.

614
00:46:15,144 --> 00:46:16,271
You're lucky...

615
00:46:17,814 --> 00:46:19,858
having seen it through
to the end.

616
00:46:20,942 --> 00:46:22,402
I hope I'm that lucky.

617
00:46:24,863 --> 00:46:26,114
Oh, well.

618
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:30,118
Without me by your side,
I doubt you'll get close enough

619
00:46:30,285 --> 00:46:32,829
to a criminal to ever be
in danger again.

620
00:46:37,625 --> 00:46:39,878
Just when I was starting
to feel sorry for you.

621
00:46:41,963 --> 00:46:44,716
Indians ain't supposed
to feel sorry for cowboys.

622
00:46:44,883 --> 00:46:46,509
It's the other way around.

623
00:46:55,101 --> 00:46:56,811
And this makes you the executor?

624
00:46:56,978 --> 00:46:58,521
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

625
00:46:58,688 --> 00:47:01,441
So, no matter what they charge us with,
they can't take it away?

626
00:47:01,608 --> 00:47:04,152
There's no way to trace funds
from a casino, all right?

627
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:07,697
Once you get the checks to the bank,
trust is untouchable.

628
00:47:07,864 --> 00:47:11,576
You can't tell
nobody nothing, right?

629
00:47:11,743 --> 00:47:12,952
Well, what is there to tell?

630
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:15,997
I mean, you boys won
that money gambling, didn't you?

631
00:47:18,625 --> 00:47:21,669
$32,000 pays off
the reverse mortgage.

632
00:47:21,836 --> 00:47:25,298
And those bastards paid
the property tax from 2012 to now.

633
00:47:25,465 --> 00:47:27,508
That's another $11,000.

634
00:47:27,675 --> 00:47:30,637
So, $43,000
and you are free and clear.

635
00:47:31,721 --> 00:47:35,433
Just have the loan officer
fax me a release of lien,

636
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:38,144
and I'll get that over
to the lease manager at Chevron.

637
00:47:38,311 --> 00:47:40,313
- The fax number is on the card.
- Okay.

638
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,148
How much you making
on this deal?

639
00:47:43,274 --> 00:47:45,693
Not near as much as I'm risking.

640
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:46,986
Why you doin' it, then?

641
00:47:52,742 --> 00:47:55,203
You know, they loaned
the least they could.

642
00:47:55,370 --> 00:47:58,539
Just enough to keep your mama poor
on a guaranteed return.

643
00:47:59,791 --> 00:48:03,294
Thought they could swipe
her land for $25,000.

644
00:48:04,462 --> 00:48:06,965
That's just so arrogant,
it makes my teeth hurt.

645
00:48:10,051 --> 00:48:11,344
To see you boys...

646
00:48:12,345 --> 00:48:14,806
pay those bastards back
with their own money?

647
00:48:17,725 --> 00:48:19,769
Well, if that ain't Texan,
I don't know what is.

648
00:48:25,233 --> 00:48:26,401
Thank you.

649
00:48:26,567 --> 00:48:28,444
Now, they can foreclose
on Friday.

650
00:48:28,611 --> 00:48:29,696
Come hell or high water,

651
00:48:29,862 --> 00:48:31,406
be at the bank in Childress
on Thursday.

652
00:48:31,572 --> 00:48:32,991
Knowing them fuckers,
they will close early.

653
00:48:33,157 --> 00:48:35,743
- We'll be there.
- Oh, and, Toby.

654
00:48:35,910 --> 00:48:38,037
The trust needs to be managed
by a bank.

655
00:48:38,204 --> 00:48:40,206
You really wanna cover
your tracks?

656
00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:43,918
You get Texas Midland
to handle this trust.

657
00:49:02,478 --> 00:49:06,065
So, what's the plan?

658
00:49:06,232 --> 00:49:09,485
We're gonna watch that bank
like a deer feeder.

659
00:49:09,652 --> 00:49:11,904
In time, we'll be right.

660
00:49:12,071 --> 00:49:14,615
Now, let's see
what they got to eat here.

661
00:49:15,867 --> 00:49:18,036
Howdy, ma'am.
How you doing today?

662
00:49:18,202 --> 00:49:20,955
Hot, and I don't mean
the good kind.

663
00:49:21,956 --> 00:49:23,958
So, what don't you want?

664
00:49:24,125 --> 00:49:25,752
Pardon?

665
00:49:25,918 --> 00:49:27,503
What don't you want?

666
00:49:29,047 --> 00:49:32,467
Oh, well, uh,
I think I'll just, uh...

667
00:49:32,633 --> 00:49:35,762
You know, I've been working here
for 44 years.

668
00:49:35,928 --> 00:49:38,014
Ain't nobody
ever ordered nothing

669
00:49:38,181 --> 00:49:40,808
but T-bone steak
and a baked potato.

670
00:49:40,975 --> 00:49:43,478
Except this one asshole
from New York

671
00:49:43,644 --> 00:49:46,731
tried to order trout
back in 1987.

672
00:49:46,898 --> 00:49:49,317
We don't sell
no goddamned trout.

673
00:49:50,318 --> 00:49:52,820
T-bone steaks.

674
00:49:52,987 --> 00:49:56,824
So, either you don't want
the corn on the cob,

675
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:59,368
or you don't want
the green beans.

676
00:49:59,535 --> 00:50:00,995
So, what don't you want?

677
00:50:05,166 --> 00:50:06,667
I don't want green beans.

678
00:50:06,834 --> 00:50:08,628
I don't want green beans either.

679
00:50:08,795 --> 00:50:10,880
Steaks cooked medium rare.

680
00:50:11,047 --> 00:50:14,342
- Can I get my steak cooked...
- That weren't no question.

681
00:50:14,509 --> 00:50:15,551
All right.

682
00:50:16,552 --> 00:50:18,596
Iced tea for you boys.

683
00:50:18,763 --> 00:50:20,014
Iced tea would be great.

684
00:50:21,307 --> 00:50:23,267
Iced tea, yep.
Thank you, ma'am.

685
00:50:23,434 --> 00:50:24,644
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

686
00:50:28,314 --> 00:50:29,941
Well, I'll tell you one thing.

687
00:50:31,192 --> 00:50:33,152
Nobody's gonna rob
this son of a bitch.

688
00:50:34,821 --> 00:50:35,905
My word.

689
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:45,706
How's she feel?

690
00:50:46,874 --> 00:50:48,543
She runs good.

691
00:50:48,709 --> 00:50:50,795
Ain't gonna win any races.

692
00:50:50,962 --> 00:50:52,505
Got New Mexico plates.

693
00:50:54,173 --> 00:50:55,424
She got a top?

694
00:50:55,591 --> 00:50:56,717
How she came.

695
00:50:58,636 --> 00:51:00,304
We'll take her.

696
00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:04,600
Don't report it stolen till Friday.

697
00:51:11,858 --> 00:51:13,776
The guy from Chevron
is dropping off the lease agreement.

698
00:51:13,943 --> 00:51:15,820
Are you okay dealing with that
by yourself?

699
00:51:15,987 --> 00:51:17,613
You okay being with Debbie
by yourself?

700
00:51:18,739 --> 00:51:19,866
Remember,
he ain't the enemy.

701
00:51:20,032 --> 00:51:22,743
Just take the papers,
say thank you.

702
00:51:23,786 --> 00:51:25,913
The oil man is the enemy,
make no mistake.

703
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:27,331
He just ain't ours.

704
00:51:29,584 --> 00:51:30,835
I'll be back to the ranch by dark.

705
00:51:31,002 --> 00:51:32,003
I will be waiting.

706
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:34,380
Drive like a schoolteacher
with all this shit in the back.

707
00:51:38,217 --> 00:51:40,678
Sure feels like beer o'clock.

708
00:51:41,971 --> 00:51:44,932
Ask and you shall receive.

709
00:52:14,253 --> 00:52:15,296
<i>Come in.</i>

710
00:52:26,224 --> 00:52:27,683
Mama died.

711
00:52:27,850 --> 00:52:29,518
When?

712
00:52:29,685 --> 00:52:30,853
A few weeks ago.

713
00:52:32,521 --> 00:52:33,814
Well, good riddance.

714
00:52:35,149 --> 00:52:36,275
No offense.

715
00:52:38,861 --> 00:52:39,904
You Okay?

716
00:52:41,614 --> 00:52:42,698
You?

717
00:52:46,661 --> 00:52:47,870
Here's the money I owe you.

718
00:52:50,665 --> 00:52:53,251
I guess you'll be selling
the ranch.

719
00:52:54,252 --> 00:52:55,503
It goes to the boys.

720
00:52:55,670 --> 00:52:56,671
- Really?
- Mmm.

721
00:52:56,837 --> 00:52:58,339
It's been put in a trust.

722
00:52:58,506 --> 00:52:59,674
What's that mean?

723
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:01,133
It means no one can sell it.

724
00:53:02,677 --> 00:53:04,053
Great.

725
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:06,305
Something else
I got to take care of.

726
00:53:19,277 --> 00:53:20,403
Hi.

727
00:53:58,024 --> 00:53:59,150
Where's your brother?

728
00:54:01,193 --> 00:54:02,278
I don't know.

729
00:54:03,362 --> 00:54:04,697
Friend's house, I guess.

730
00:54:11,203 --> 00:54:12,538
How come you ain't in school?

731
00:54:13,622 --> 00:54:15,458
School don't start yet.

732
00:54:15,624 --> 00:54:18,336
Just two-a-days
for football right now.

733
00:54:24,550 --> 00:54:26,052
Your grandmother died.

734
00:54:28,679 --> 00:54:30,723
I'm giving the ranch
to you and your brother.

735
00:54:32,808 --> 00:54:34,602
Remember going out there
when you was little?

736
00:54:36,729 --> 00:54:38,564
What am I supposed to do
with a ranch?

737
00:54:40,066 --> 00:54:41,233
Anything but sell it.

738
00:54:43,903 --> 00:54:45,279
We found oil on it.

739
00:54:47,865 --> 00:54:50,576
You and your brother ain't gonna
have to worry about money no more.

740
00:54:53,329 --> 00:54:54,330
Now...

741
00:54:55,998 --> 00:54:58,793
you may be hearing
a lot of things about me and...

742
00:54:59,919 --> 00:55:01,045
your uncle.

743
00:55:04,048 --> 00:55:05,424
Don't be like us.

744
00:55:05,591 --> 00:55:06,717
You hear me?

745
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:10,596
Whatever I hear,
I won't believe.

746
00:55:10,763 --> 00:55:11,972
No, you believe it.

747
00:55:13,474 --> 00:55:14,725
I did all of it.

748
00:55:17,269 --> 00:55:19,021
Now, you, you do it different.

749
00:55:29,865 --> 00:55:30,991
Ain't gonna drink it?

750
00:55:34,370 --> 00:55:37,581
You tell me not to be like you,
and then you offer me a beer.

751
00:55:37,748 --> 00:55:38,833
Which is it?

752
00:55:41,877 --> 00:55:42,962
Good boy.

753
00:56:03,899 --> 00:56:06,235
- How are the boys?
- What are you doin'?

754
00:56:06,402 --> 00:56:07,528
Insurance.

755
00:56:08,529 --> 00:56:10,322
I don't want that shit in the car.

756
00:56:10,489 --> 00:56:13,325
We'll be running two cars
next time, brother.

757
00:56:13,492 --> 00:56:14,618
They'll ride with me.

758
00:56:21,041 --> 00:56:22,710
So, this is your plan?

759
00:56:22,877 --> 00:56:24,295
We're just gonna sit here

760
00:56:24,462 --> 00:56:26,755
and see if this is the branch
they rob next.

761
00:56:26,922 --> 00:56:28,048
What would you rather do?

762
00:56:28,215 --> 00:56:29,884
You wanna drive 80 miles
back to Olney

763
00:56:30,050 --> 00:56:32,761
and look for more fingerprints
that we ain't gonna find?

764
00:56:32,928 --> 00:56:35,681
Or you wanna drive 200 miles
back to Lubbock

765
00:56:35,848 --> 00:56:37,975
and look at mugshots that don't matter
'cause nobody knows

766
00:56:38,142 --> 00:56:39,685
what these sons of bitches
look like?

767
00:56:39,852 --> 00:56:42,438
Or we can just wait here
for them to rob this bank,

768
00:56:42,605 --> 00:56:45,316
which is the one thing I'm pretty
damn sure they are going to do.

769
00:56:45,483 --> 00:56:46,650
I know what you're doing.

770
00:56:48,068 --> 00:56:50,070
You're trying to make this last
as long as you can

771
00:56:50,237 --> 00:56:51,405
because the longer it lasts,

772
00:56:51,572 --> 00:56:53,157
the farther you are
from that front porch.

773
00:56:53,324 --> 00:56:55,826
No, I'm waitin' for these boys
to make a mistake.

774
00:56:55,993 --> 00:56:57,620
So far they ain't, but they will.

775
00:56:57,786 --> 00:56:59,038
And they're gonna make it here.

776
00:57:00,372 --> 00:57:01,874
So, just relax.

777
00:57:03,167 --> 00:57:04,710
Enjoy this little town.

778
00:57:04,877 --> 00:57:06,128
Do you wanna live here?

779
00:57:06,295 --> 00:57:07,546
Got an old hardware store

780
00:57:07,713 --> 00:57:10,257
that charges twice
what Home Depot does,

781
00:57:10,424 --> 00:57:14,345
one restaurant with
a rattlesnake for a waitress.

782
00:57:14,512 --> 00:57:17,348
I mean, how is anybody
supposed to make a living here?

783
00:57:17,515 --> 00:57:20,184
People have made a living here
for 150 years.

784
00:57:20,351 --> 00:57:23,020
Well, people lived in caves
for 150,000 years,

785
00:57:23,187 --> 00:57:24,438
but they don't do it no more.

786
00:57:24,605 --> 00:57:27,274
Well, maybe your people did.

787
00:57:27,441 --> 00:57:29,026
Your people did, too.

788
00:57:30,611 --> 00:57:33,531
A long time ago,
your ancestors was the Indians...

789
00:57:35,074 --> 00:57:37,451
till someone came along
and killed them,

790
00:57:37,618 --> 00:57:40,704
broke 'em down,
made you into one of them.

791
00:57:42,206 --> 00:57:47,044
150 years ago, all this
was my ancestors' land.

792
00:57:48,629 --> 00:57:50,256
Everything you can see.

793
00:57:51,507 --> 00:57:53,342
Everything you saw yesterday.

794
00:57:54,552 --> 00:57:57,096
Till the grandparents
of these folks took it.

795
00:57:59,473 --> 00:58:01,267
And now, it's been taken
from them.

796
00:58:02,601 --> 00:58:04,603
Except it ain't no army doing it.

797
00:58:05,938 --> 00:58:08,065
It's those sons of bitches
right there.

798
00:58:18,325 --> 00:58:19,618
You thinking about tomorrow?

799
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:23,247
Ain't you?

800
00:58:24,498 --> 00:58:26,000
The little hotel clerk.

801
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:29,545
Why is it always the sweet ones

802
00:58:29,712 --> 00:58:32,381
that are such devils
when you get them revved up?

803
00:58:33,799 --> 00:58:36,093
Wouldn't know.
Never had a sweet one.

804
00:58:37,428 --> 00:58:40,931
Yeah, you like them pissed off,
lookin' for someone to blame.

805
00:58:42,725 --> 00:58:44,226
Sure seems that way.

806
00:58:56,739 --> 00:58:58,115
It's a good thing you're doing.

807
00:59:01,327 --> 00:59:02,453
We're doing it.

808
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,720
Go easy on the bank teller
tomorrow.

809
00:59:21,096 --> 00:59:23,515
I'll be as gentle
as a young nurse.

810
01:00:27,996 --> 01:00:29,039
You coming?

811
01:00:30,165 --> 01:00:31,375
On my Way-

812
01:01:15,627 --> 01:01:16,670
Hey.

813
01:01:17,755 --> 01:01:18,797
Shit.

814
01:01:23,010 --> 01:01:24,094
Morning.

815
01:01:26,597 --> 01:01:27,639
You want some breakfast?

816
01:01:27,806 --> 01:01:29,558
Yeah, breakfast sounds good.

817
01:01:34,229 --> 01:01:37,316
So we hit the Jayton branch first,
then Coleman, right?

818
01:01:37,483 --> 01:01:39,151
Yeah, that should get us
what we need.

819
01:02:34,790 --> 01:02:36,041
Let's do this.

820
01:02:39,503 --> 01:02:42,047
Ugh... shit.

821
01:02:43,048 --> 01:02:44,258
That's not part of the fucking plan.

822
01:02:44,424 --> 01:02:45,926
The bastards closed down
the branch.

823
01:02:48,345 --> 01:02:49,429
What now, little brother?

824
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:52,850
Coleman.

825
01:03:27,759 --> 01:03:29,761
- What the hell you doing?
- We gotta head to Post.

826
01:03:29,928 --> 01:03:31,263
- What the hell are you doing?
- Get...

827
01:03:37,936 --> 01:03:40,188
- We got to head to Post.
- What are you talking about?

828
01:03:40,355 --> 01:03:42,149
We got to head to Post.

829
01:03:42,316 --> 01:03:43,400
We're going to Coleman.

830
01:03:43,567 --> 01:03:44,902
There's only one teller in Coleman.

831
01:03:45,068 --> 01:03:46,486
Whatever we get won't be enough.

832
01:03:48,071 --> 01:03:49,156
We go to Coleman right now.

833
01:03:49,323 --> 01:03:50,449
If that ain't enough,
we head to Post.

834
01:03:50,616 --> 01:03:53,118
If we don't leave now for Post,
we won't get there till noon.

835
01:03:53,285 --> 01:03:54,995
You don't wanna rob a bank
at lunchtime, do you?

836
01:03:56,163 --> 01:03:57,664
Yeah, we don't know the patterns
of folks out there.

837
01:03:57,831 --> 01:03:59,374
The patterns
are the same everywhere.

838
01:03:59,541 --> 01:04:01,627
All these towns are dead.
Post ain't no different.

839
01:04:02,878 --> 01:04:03,962
It's a bigger bank.

840
01:04:05,088 --> 01:04:07,049
<i>We'll leave your car
just out of town.</i>

841
01:04:07,215 --> 01:04:08,300
<i>Come on, now.</i>

842
01:04:09,343 --> 01:04:11,011
Shit.

843
01:04:18,644 --> 01:04:20,187
I think I got this figured.

844
01:04:21,313 --> 01:04:25,692
First two banks,
they were Texas Midland Banks.

845
01:04:26,693 --> 01:04:28,737
All right, there are seven
branches altogether.

846
01:04:28,904 --> 01:04:31,031
The main branch is in Fort Worth.

847
01:04:31,198 --> 01:04:32,658
They're not gonna mess with that.

848
01:04:33,992 --> 01:04:37,412
All right, they hit
the branch in Olney.

849
01:04:37,579 --> 01:04:40,207
They hit the one in Archer City.

850
01:04:40,374 --> 01:04:43,335
- Then there's the one here.
- Which they did not hit.

851
01:04:44,962 --> 01:04:49,049
Alberto, will you please
follow me?

852
01:04:50,634 --> 01:04:52,552
Don't let... just keep
your mouth shut

853
01:04:52,719 --> 01:04:54,596
and just listen
to what I'm gonna say.

854
01:04:54,763 --> 01:04:56,181
There's the one here...

855
01:04:57,432 --> 01:04:59,309
then there's the one
in Childress.

856
01:04:59,476 --> 01:05:00,811
There's the one in Jayton.

857
01:05:00,978 --> 01:05:02,312
That one's closed.

858
01:05:02,479 --> 01:05:04,231
I know that one's closed!

859
01:05:07,025 --> 01:05:09,611
I know that one's closed,
Alberto.

860
01:05:12,489 --> 01:05:13,991
That's my point.

861
01:05:14,157 --> 01:05:16,576
Jayton is closed.

862
01:05:16,743 --> 01:05:18,245
That just leaves Post.

863
01:05:18,412 --> 01:05:19,955
They're not gonna mess
with the bank in Childress.

864
01:05:20,122 --> 01:05:23,333
That's a fairly
decent-sized town.

865
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:26,211
The branch in Vernon
wasn't Midlands and they hit that.

866
01:05:26,378 --> 01:05:28,755
Yeah, one of them did.
Alone.

867
01:05:28,922 --> 01:05:31,008
Then he ran all the way
across the road to get to the car.

868
01:05:32,009 --> 01:05:34,219
I think his partner had no idea
that was gonna happen.

869
01:05:34,386 --> 01:05:35,470
What does that mean to us?

870
01:05:35,637 --> 01:05:39,224
It means that the only branch
that fits the bill is in Post.

871
01:05:39,391 --> 01:05:40,434
Well, then let's go.

872
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:10,172
The town looks busy.

873
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:12,883
Little bit.

874
01:06:21,516 --> 01:06:23,018
My word.

875
01:06:33,487 --> 01:06:34,821
It's too big.

876
01:06:34,988 --> 01:06:36,281
That's what she said.

877
01:06:39,576 --> 01:06:41,495
It's no good.

878
01:06:41,661 --> 01:06:43,747
Aw, this ain't your first rodeo.

879
01:06:46,041 --> 01:06:47,209
Bigger bank...

880
01:06:49,377 --> 01:06:50,545
more money.

881
01:07:09,481 --> 01:07:12,192
Everybody,
get on the fucking ground!

882
01:07:12,359 --> 01:07:13,944
Get on the fucking ground!

883
01:07:14,111 --> 01:07:17,364
Young ladies, get on
the fucking ground! Now!

884
01:07:17,531 --> 01:07:21,827
Sir, down!
On the ground! Now!

885
01:07:21,993 --> 01:07:23,537
Thank you very much.

886
01:07:27,290 --> 01:07:28,542
Tellers, stand up!

887
01:07:30,794 --> 01:07:32,712
Open the drawers!

888
01:07:35,924 --> 01:07:37,884
Get down!

889
01:07:38,051 --> 01:07:40,095
Take three steps back!

890
01:07:40,262 --> 01:07:42,639
Open the fucking drawer,
young lady!

891
01:07:42,806 --> 01:07:44,224
Are you deaf and dumb?

892
01:07:44,391 --> 01:07:46,601
I said open
the motherfucking drawer!

893
01:07:46,768 --> 01:07:48,395
- You, down!
- All right. Oh, please.

894
01:07:48,562 --> 01:07:50,397
<i>Now step back!</i>

895
01:07:51,648 --> 01:07:52,649
Very good.

896
01:07:52,816 --> 01:07:54,651
Someone's paying attention.

897
01:07:56,528 --> 01:08:00,615
Now get on
your motherfucking knees!

898
01:08:00,782 --> 01:08:01,867
Hey!

899
01:08:02,868 --> 01:08:04,327
Stay down!

900
01:08:12,794 --> 01:08:14,045
All right.

901
01:08:35,150 --> 01:08:36,401
Dude.

902
01:08:48,330 --> 01:08:49,497
Hey, hey, let's go!

903
01:08:49,664 --> 01:08:50,999
<i>Call 911!</i>

904
01:08:52,542 --> 01:08:54,002
Jesus fucking Christ.

905
01:08:55,629 --> 01:08:57,505
The whole goddamn town
is shooting at us.

906
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:01,092
Get in the back.
Get in the fucking back.

907
01:09:14,146 --> 01:09:16,148
Come on, let's go!
Get in the car!

908
01:09:16,315 --> 01:09:17,399
Don't let them get away!

909
01:09:20,819 --> 01:09:22,904
How you doing back there,
little brother?

910
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:24,406
You fucking killed them.

911
01:09:24,573 --> 01:09:25,866
These concealed carry permits

912
01:09:26,033 --> 01:09:28,327
sure complicate
a bank robbery, don't they?

913
01:09:28,493 --> 01:09:30,120
It's not my fault it was payday.

914
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:36,416
This has gone too far, Tan.

915
01:09:36,583 --> 01:09:38,460
No one was supposed
to fucking die.

916
01:09:38,627 --> 01:09:41,171
It was them or us.
Take your pick.

917
01:09:55,809 --> 01:09:57,436
Yeah, go, Margaret.

918
01:09:57,603 --> 01:09:59,813
Texas Midlands in Post
has just been hit.

919
01:09:59,980 --> 01:10:02,274
Ah! What did <i>I</i> tell you?

920
01:10:02,441 --> 01:10:03,483
Yeah.

921
01:10:03,650 --> 01:10:05,611
- Yeah!
- Locals are in chase.

922
01:10:05,777 --> 01:10:07,404
Suspects escaping west

923
01:10:07,571 --> 01:10:09,239
in an old Bronco.

924
01:10:09,406 --> 01:10:11,867
All right, Margaret, keep us posted.
We're on our way there.

925
01:10:12,034 --> 01:10:13,869
Give me an Indian whoop.
Come on.

926
01:10:16,496 --> 01:10:18,040
These boys are gonna go down.

927
01:10:18,206 --> 01:10:20,876
Let's get some giddy-up music
going on there.

928
01:10:25,213 --> 01:10:26,256
Oh, please, not that.

929
01:10:45,975 --> 01:10:47,059
Yeah.

930
01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:52,273
Hey, hey. Come on.
Snap out of it.

931
01:10:55,776 --> 01:10:58,279
Snap the fuck out of it.

932
01:10:58,446 --> 01:11:00,614
Shit, let me see that.
You're hit.

933
01:11:00,781 --> 01:11:02,241
Boy, you're hit.
Get the back.

934
01:11:04,618 --> 01:11:07,330
Well, you'll live.
It's a through and through.

935
01:11:07,496 --> 01:11:11,167
Compress it. Wrap it up.
You got to wrap it up tight.

936
01:11:11,334 --> 01:11:12,710
Front and back,
front and back.

937
01:11:15,373 --> 01:11:16,416
Wrap it tight.

938
01:11:22,797 --> 01:11:25,842
Oh, brother, hear me now,
hear me clear.

939
01:11:26,009 --> 01:11:28,595
Unless you wanna be a black mark
on your sons' lives,

940
01:11:28,762 --> 01:11:30,847
I need you mountain lion mean.

941
01:11:31,014 --> 01:11:32,724
You hear me?

942
01:11:32,891 --> 01:11:33,975
I hear you.

943
01:11:34,142 --> 01:11:35,393
- Mountain lion mean.
- Yeah.

944
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:39,397
Yeah. It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

945
01:11:39,564 --> 01:11:40,732
- Hold on.
- Yeah.

946
01:12:37,747 --> 01:12:38,748
Go.

947
01:12:50,176 --> 01:12:51,302
Here, take the money.

948
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:57,267
- Let's go.
- Get to the casino.

949
01:12:57,433 --> 01:12:58,685
Change the money
like we planned.

950
01:12:58,852 --> 01:13:02,146
This was your plan,
and it worked.

951
01:13:02,313 --> 01:13:03,648
Every step of the way.

952
01:13:04,816 --> 01:13:06,025
Trust it.

953
01:13:11,531 --> 01:13:12,782
Where are you headed?

954
01:13:18,872 --> 01:13:19,956
Don't be stupid.

955
01:13:23,585 --> 01:13:24,878
I love you, Toby.

956
01:13:28,631 --> 01:13:29,757
I mean it.

957
01:13:36,973 --> 01:13:38,266
I love you, too.

958
01:13:44,147 --> 01:13:46,482
Hey, Tobe, go fuck yourself.

959
01:13:46,649 --> 01:13:47,817
Go fuck yourself.

960
01:14:04,542 --> 01:14:08,087
As I walked out
one sunny morning

961
01:14:08,254 --> 01:14:11,591
I spied a young cowboy
a loping along

962
01:14:11,758 --> 01:14:13,635
His hat was laid back

963
01:14:13,801 --> 01:14:15,762
His spurs were a jinglin'

964
01:14:15,929 --> 01:14:19,307
And as he come near me
He's singing this song

965
01:14:24,395 --> 01:14:26,898
Yippee hiyiyo.
You little doggies.

966
01:14:27,065 --> 01:14:30,610
It's your misfortune
and none of my own

967
01:14:59,514 --> 01:15:02,100
This is what they call
white man's intuition.

968
01:15:03,309 --> 01:15:05,478
Sometimes a blind pig
finds a truffle.

969
01:15:12,610 --> 01:15:17,115
It's your misfortune
and none of my own

970
01:16:00,908 --> 01:16:03,619
Back up! Oh, shit!

971
01:16:03,786 --> 01:16:05,413
Go! Move!

972
01:16:16,424 --> 01:16:17,759
My word.

973
01:16:17,925 --> 01:16:19,969
All right, We're gonna need
a SWAT unit up here

974
01:16:20,136 --> 01:16:22,013
and a helo to pin
these boys down.

975
01:16:33,107 --> 01:16:34,942
<i>Suspect is a white male.</i>

976
01:16:36,319 --> 01:16:37,361
<i>Guys, spread it out!</i>

977
01:16:39,072 --> 01:16:40,281
He's got a rifle.
Get down!

978
01:16:40,448 --> 01:16:42,325
<i>He's on the ridge!
He's on the ridge!</i>

979
01:16:44,702 --> 01:16:46,079
Come on, I see him!

980
01:16:48,956 --> 01:16:49,957
There's <i>just</i> one?

981
01:16:50,124 --> 01:16:51,292
Yep, just one.

982
01:16:51,459 --> 01:16:52,710
There's supposed
to be two of them.

983
01:16:52,877 --> 01:16:54,921
Maybe the town folks got one.

984
01:16:56,464 --> 01:16:58,549
Well, if they did,
they got the smart one.

985
01:16:58,716 --> 01:17:00,718
This old boy
is out of his mind.

986
01:17:00,885 --> 01:17:04,514
Why don't you slip up this canyon
and tomahawk that son of a bitch?

987
01:17:23,491 --> 01:17:25,493
Ranger down.
Call it in.

988
01:17:25,660 --> 01:17:29,580
Get back! Back!
Back those trucks up!

989
01:17:31,249 --> 01:17:32,375
Get back!

990
01:17:33,626 --> 01:17:35,086
Get these trucks back.

991
01:17:35,253 --> 01:17:36,921
Back up!

992
01:17:39,298 --> 01:17:40,383
Back them up.

993
01:17:40,550 --> 01:17:42,009
How well do you know the land
around here?

994
01:17:42,176 --> 01:17:44,095
Like the back of my hand.

995
01:17:44,262 --> 01:17:46,681
All right, he's hid up
in that brush on that hill.

996
01:17:46,848 --> 01:17:48,349
Can you get me up there
behind him?

997
01:17:48,516 --> 01:17:50,017
Give me a half hour,
I'll have that bastard

998
01:17:50,184 --> 01:17:52,436
field dressed on the hood
of my truck.

999
01:17:52,603 --> 01:17:54,355
I can't let you do that.
You just get me there.

1000
01:17:54,522 --> 01:17:56,566
That's gonna be a 500-yard shot
if he's where you said.

1001
01:17:56,732 --> 01:17:57,859
Just get me there!

1002
01:18:12,540 --> 01:18:13,708
Shit.

1003
01:18:58,085 --> 01:18:59,212
How are you doing?

1004
01:18:59,378 --> 01:19:01,589
Good. You?

1005
01:19:01,756 --> 01:19:03,007
Where are you headed?

1006
01:19:03,174 --> 01:19:04,258
Ruidoso.

1007
01:19:06,427 --> 01:19:07,470
Where you from?

1008
01:19:07,637 --> 01:19:08,679
Hamlin.

1009
01:19:11,390 --> 01:19:12,558
Taking the scenic route?

1010
01:19:13,601 --> 01:19:16,187
Taking the only way I can.

1011
01:19:16,354 --> 01:19:17,563
They got the road closed
at Post.

1012
01:19:17,730 --> 01:19:19,649
Everywhere you turn
they got the road closed.

1013
01:19:21,234 --> 01:19:23,319
- You got your license on you?
- Yes, I do.

1014
01:19:28,241 --> 01:19:29,325
Wait right there.

1015
01:19:29,492 --> 01:19:30,576
Yes, sir.

1016
01:20:08,614 --> 01:20:10,241
- Sir.
- Yeah.

1017
01:20:11,492 --> 01:20:13,452
Have a good day.

1018
01:20:13,619 --> 01:20:14,704
Thanks much.

1019
01:21:17,308 --> 01:21:19,101
You're pretty winded.

1020
01:21:19,268 --> 01:21:21,896
You oughta let me take the shot.
Hell, it's my gun.

1021
01:21:22,063 --> 01:21:24,190
Not on your life.

1022
01:21:24,357 --> 01:21:25,900
He's mine.

1023
01:21:55,596 --> 01:21:56,764
<i>Just left of the tree.</i>

1024
01:21:56,931 --> 01:21:58,015
I got him.

1025
01:22:14,407 --> 01:22:15,866
I got you.

1026
01:22:24,625 --> 01:22:26,001
Lord of the Plains.

1027
01:22:29,130 --> 01:22:30,339
That's me.

1029
01:23:45,664 --> 01:23:48,501
<i>Texas Highway Patrol
and the locals</i>

1030
01:23:48,667 --> 01:23:52,213
<i>chased the robbers
to this hillside behind me,</i>

1031
01:23:52,379 --> 01:23:56,425
<i>20 miles west of town,
where the gunfight continued.</i>

1032
01:23:56,592 --> 01:23:58,010
<i>And right now we do know</i>

1033
01:23:58,177 --> 01:24:02,139
<i>Ranger Marcus Hamilton
killed one of the gunmen</i>

1034
01:24:02,306 --> 01:24:05,851
<i>using a rifle he actually borrowed
from a resident here.</i>

1035
01:24:06,018 --> 01:24:09,063
<i>We don't know the name
of that suspect yet...</i>

1036
01:25:06,328 --> 01:25:07,496
Lucky guy-

1037
01:25:09,957 --> 01:25:12,209
Just in the nick of time, too.

1038
01:25:12,376 --> 01:25:13,544
What are the odds?

1039
01:25:16,839 --> 01:25:20,634
Now, this, uh, satisfies

1040
01:25:20,801 --> 01:25:23,887
both the reverse mortgage loan
and the, uh...

1041
01:25:24,054 --> 01:25:26,682
and the back taxes that we've paid
on your mother's behalf.

1042
01:25:26,849 --> 01:25:29,143
We do that as courtesy,
of course.

1043
01:25:33,522 --> 01:25:36,108
You can fax the release of lien
to that number.

1044
01:25:40,029 --> 01:25:41,155
An attorney?

1045
01:25:43,782 --> 01:25:46,452
All right, well, I'll... I'll get that
faxed over to your attorney

1046
01:25:46,619 --> 01:25:47,703
by the end of the week.

1047
01:25:47,870 --> 01:25:50,122
It is the end of the week.
I wanna watch you do it.

1048
01:25:55,002 --> 01:25:58,714
Well, it takes a little time
to prepare.

1049
01:25:58,881 --> 01:26:00,174
I got all day.

1050
01:26:08,974 --> 01:26:11,143
Here we go.

1051
01:26:11,310 --> 01:26:14,229
Okay. That's it.

1052
01:26:14,396 --> 01:26:18,192
And it's been a pleasure
doing business with you.

1053
01:26:32,998 --> 01:26:34,333
Let me ask you a question.

1054
01:26:36,126 --> 01:26:37,544
Do y'all manage trusts?

1055
01:26:43,050 --> 01:26:44,927
Hey, Marcus,
ain't you supposed to be retired?

1056
01:26:45,094 --> 01:26:46,136
Howdy.

1057
01:26:51,308 --> 01:26:53,560
- Shelley.
- Nice to see you.

1058
01:26:53,727 --> 01:26:55,604
- Well, hey, Marcus.
- Hey, Margaret.

1059
01:26:55,771 --> 01:26:57,314
Been awhile.
How's life as a civilian?

1060
01:26:57,481 --> 01:27:00,984
Oh, just, you know...

1061
01:27:01,151 --> 01:27:04,113
Think I can take a peek
at Mr. Howard's file?

1062
01:27:04,279 --> 01:27:05,447
Tanner Howard.

1063
01:27:06,949 --> 01:27:09,910
Oh, come on.
I ain't got nothing better to do.

1064
01:27:10,077 --> 01:27:11,203
It's at my desk.

1065
01:27:12,329 --> 01:27:13,455
Uh...

1066
01:27:18,669 --> 01:27:21,046
Killed his father
in a hunting accident, huh?

1067
01:27:21,213 --> 01:27:24,133
<i>I'd love to know what he was hunting
in the barn in April.</i>

1068
01:27:24,299 --> 01:27:27,761
10 years in Huntsville
for aggravated assault.

1069
01:27:27,928 --> 01:27:29,513
Cellmate was released in 2012.

1070
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:31,056
Before that,
he served seven years

1071
01:27:31,223 --> 01:27:33,308
on bank robbery charges
up in Big Spring.

1072
01:27:33,475 --> 01:27:35,728
Been trying to track him down,
but no luck so far.

1073
01:27:35,894 --> 01:27:37,604
You all are off the brother?

1074
01:27:37,771 --> 01:27:39,690
There's nothing that links him
to the robberies.

1075
01:27:40,858 --> 01:27:43,068
Now, what about
that little waitress in Vernon?

1076
01:27:43,235 --> 01:27:44,319
Yeah, we showed her photos.

1077
01:27:44,486 --> 01:27:46,196
She said she didn't
recognize him.

1078
01:27:46,363 --> 01:27:48,657
Pretty upset you took
her tips as evidence.

1079
01:27:50,242 --> 01:27:51,827
She sure was sassy.

1080
01:27:51,994 --> 01:27:53,746
You show that
to that old timer?

1081
01:27:53,912 --> 01:27:56,623
<i>Yep. He said he didn't look
like the fella from the diner.</i>

1082
01:27:56,790 --> 01:27:59,084
He didn't recognize
Tanner's photo either.

1083
01:27:59,251 --> 01:28:02,212
Yeah, tried to get a court order
on his bank accounts and the ranch,

1084
01:28:02,379 --> 01:28:03,422
DA wouldn't do it.

1085
01:28:03,589 --> 01:28:06,091
Toby's got no record.
He's never been arrested.

1086
01:28:06,258 --> 01:28:08,385
His only court appearance
was at his divorce.

1087
01:28:08,552 --> 01:28:10,554
He don't fit the bill, Marcus.

1088
01:28:10,721 --> 01:28:12,139
People don't start out
robbing banks.

1089
01:28:12,306 --> 01:28:14,600
They graduate to it
like his asshole brother.

1090
01:28:14,767 --> 01:28:16,226
Besides,
when we was out there,

1091
01:28:16,393 --> 01:28:17,978
we saw two crews from Chevron

1092
01:28:18,145 --> 01:28:20,397
capping wells
and putting in pumpjacks.

1093
01:28:20,564 --> 01:28:22,107
Engineers out there
said they're gonna pull

1094
01:28:22,274 --> 01:28:24,485
2,000 barrels a month
off that place.

1095
01:28:24,651 --> 01:28:27,196
You just try convincing a judge
to issue warrants on somebody

1096
01:28:27,362 --> 01:28:29,031
set to clear $50,000 a month

1097
01:28:29,198 --> 01:28:32,284
for robbing $40,000 from the bank
that manages the family trust.

1098
01:28:32,451 --> 01:28:34,495
Midland manages the trust?

1099
01:28:37,831 --> 01:28:40,000
You'd think they'd want
this thing figured out.

1100
01:28:40,167 --> 01:28:42,044
I don't think the bank cares
about anything

1101
01:28:42,211 --> 01:28:43,879
but keeping that trust
right where it is.

1102
01:28:44,963 --> 01:28:47,382
Hell, they were less cooperative
than Toby's attorney.

1103
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:53,013
Marcus, he's not a suspect
and you are retired.

1104
01:28:54,056 --> 01:28:55,224
Oh, I hear you.

1105
01:28:59,311 --> 01:29:00,687
You like my desk?

1106
01:29:02,064 --> 01:29:03,148
I don't hate it.

1107
01:29:06,068 --> 01:29:07,361
Hey, I'll see you, Marcus.

1108
01:30:44,207 --> 01:30:45,667
Know who I am?

1109
01:30:50,005 --> 01:30:52,299
I'm the man
who killed your brother.

1110
01:30:52,466 --> 01:30:53,592
I know.

1111
01:30:55,385 --> 01:30:57,721
I also know you're retired
and you're trespassing.

1112
01:30:59,014 --> 01:31:02,726
Well, you could shoot me now
and be within your rights.

1113
01:31:02,893 --> 01:31:05,896
You toting a gun and all,
how convenient.

1114
01:31:07,064 --> 01:31:08,649
I figure you got one, too.

1115
01:31:14,696 --> 01:31:15,989
Mind if I sit?

1116
01:31:20,619 --> 01:31:21,662
Go ahead.

1117
01:31:45,227 --> 01:31:46,436
You want a beer?

1118
01:31:47,646 --> 01:31:50,649
Sure.
I ain't on duty no more.

1119
01:32:01,284 --> 01:32:02,285
Thanks.

1120
01:32:07,530 --> 01:32:10,116
It's nice out here
in this breeze, huh,

1121
01:32:10,283 --> 01:32:11,910
now that it's cooled down.

1122
01:32:22,624 --> 01:32:23,750
How did you do it?

1123
01:32:26,085 --> 01:32:27,337
Oh, never mind.

1124
01:32:27,503 --> 01:32:29,422
I'll figure that out in time.

1125
01:32:29,589 --> 01:32:31,674
Why?
Why did you do it?

1126
01:32:33,509 --> 01:32:35,929
I know why your brother,
Tanner, did it.

1127
01:32:36,095 --> 01:32:38,932
He robbed them banks
because he liked it.

1128
01:32:41,389 --> 01:32:44,642
He shot my partner 300 yards away
'cause he liked it.

1129
01:32:44,809 --> 01:32:45,977
It made him feel good.

1130
01:32:48,646 --> 01:32:50,690
If I hadn't blown
his shit for brains out,

1131
01:32:50,857 --> 01:32:54,319
there'd be a new truck out front
with jet skis

1132
01:32:54,486 --> 01:32:56,362
or whatever else
he could think to buy.

1133
01:32:56,529 --> 01:33:00,742
He'd spend it all just to give
an excuse to steal some more.

1134
01:33:00,909 --> 01:33:02,285
But not you.

1135
01:33:04,863 --> 01:33:06,865
There's nothing new
around here...

1136
01:33:08,116 --> 01:33:10,994
except them pumpjacks.

1137
01:33:11,161 --> 01:33:12,746
Each one of them
making you a month

1138
01:33:12,912 --> 01:33:16,166
what you and your brother stole
from all four banks combined.

1139
01:33:17,625 --> 01:33:19,210
Help me understand, then.

1140
01:33:22,005 --> 01:33:24,257
Help me understand
why four people died...

1141
01:33:26,043 --> 01:33:29,839
so you could steal money
that it don't seem you've spent,

1142
01:33:30,006 --> 01:33:32,091
that it don't seem you need.

1143
01:33:32,258 --> 01:33:33,342
You got a family?

1144
01:33:33,509 --> 01:33:35,803
My partner had a family.
A big one.

1145
01:33:36,804 --> 01:33:38,806
They don't got no pumpjacks
in their backyard.

1146
01:33:38,973 --> 01:33:41,309
- I didn't kill your friend.
- Yes, you did.

1147
01:33:42,810 --> 01:33:44,854
By setting this thing
in motion.

1148
01:33:46,063 --> 01:33:49,233
You expect me to believe
your dimwitted brother planned this?

1149
01:33:50,443 --> 01:33:53,487
Oh, no.
This was smart.

1150
01:33:53,654 --> 01:33:54,864
This was you.

1151
01:33:58,743 --> 01:34:00,536
I've been poor my whole life.

1152
01:34:04,207 --> 01:34:06,626
So were my parents,
their parents before them.

1153
01:34:09,003 --> 01:34:10,504
It's like a disease...

1154
01:34:12,215 --> 01:34:15,176
passing from generation to generation,
becomes a sickness.

1155
01:34:15,343 --> 01:34:16,427
That's what it is.

1156
01:34:18,262 --> 01:34:19,931
Infects every person you know...

1157
01:34:21,140 --> 01:34:22,600
but not my boys.

1158
01:34:24,310 --> 01:34:25,603
Not anymore.

1159
01:34:29,357 --> 01:34:30,650
This is theirs now.

1160
01:34:35,154 --> 01:34:36,989
Now, I ain't never killed
no one in my life,

1161
01:34:37,156 --> 01:34:40,159
but if you want me to start with you,
let's get on with it, old man.

1162
01:34:41,953 --> 01:34:44,997
See if you can grab that pistol
before I blast you off this porch.

1163
01:35:24,537 --> 01:35:26,289
- Howdy.
- What's going on?

1164
01:35:27,957 --> 01:35:30,418
The hogs are back
in the garden.

1165
01:35:30,584 --> 01:35:33,045
Feral hogs tearing up this place
something fierce.

1166
01:35:34,797 --> 01:35:35,840
Who's this?

1167
01:35:36,007 --> 01:35:37,758
I'm an old friend
of your husband.

1168
01:35:38,801 --> 01:35:40,011
Ex-husband.

1169
01:35:41,971 --> 01:35:43,306
I'm just working on the house.

1170
01:35:44,432 --> 01:35:46,142
Oh, you don't live here?

1171
01:35:46,309 --> 01:35:49,103
No, it's not mine.
It's theirs.

1172
01:35:51,689 --> 01:35:53,274
Oh.

1173
01:35:53,441 --> 01:35:55,860
The things we do
for our kids, huh?

1174
01:35:58,446 --> 01:35:59,488
Well...

1175
01:36:01,532 --> 01:36:02,700
I best be going.

1176
01:36:02,867 --> 01:36:03,993
Ma'am.

1177
01:36:04,160 --> 01:36:05,953
Me, too, Debbie.
I'm gonna wash up,

1178
01:36:06,120 --> 01:36:08,748
be back around 9:00 tomorrow
to finish the front.

1179
01:36:08,914 --> 01:36:09,999
Start painting the extension

1180
01:36:10,166 --> 01:36:11,334
and then help Randy
with his homework

1181
01:36:11,500 --> 01:36:14,378
when he gets back
from school, okay?

1182
01:36:14,545 --> 01:36:15,588
Okay-

1183
01:36:18,841 --> 01:36:20,134
Hey.

1184
01:36:21,385 --> 01:36:23,304
I rent a little house in town.

1185
01:36:25,181 --> 01:36:26,932
If you wanna stop by
and finish this conversation,

1186
01:36:27,099 --> 01:36:28,309
you're welcome anytime.

1187
01:36:29,769 --> 01:36:31,270
Oh, I'd like that.

1188
01:36:32,396 --> 01:36:33,564
I'll be seeing you.

1189
01:36:33,731 --> 01:36:36,484
Yeah.
Soon, I hope.

1190
01:36:38,986 --> 01:36:40,446
I'm ready to be done
with this.

1191
01:36:40,613 --> 01:36:42,740
You'll never be done with it
no matter what.

1192
01:36:42,907 --> 01:36:45,451
It's gonna haunt you, son,
for the rest of your days.

1193
01:36:46,494 --> 01:36:48,245
But you won't be alone.

1194
01:36:48,412 --> 01:36:49,955
It's gonna haunt me, too.

1195
01:36:50,122 --> 01:36:52,208
If you stop by,
maybe I'll give you peace.

1196
01:36:52,375 --> 01:36:56,253
Maybe.
Maybe I'll give it to you.
