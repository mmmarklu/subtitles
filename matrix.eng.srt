1
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,110


2
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:49,003


3
00:00:49,203 --> 00:00:52,630
- Is everything in place?
- You weren 't supposed to relieve me.

4
00:00:52,874 --> 00:00:55,501
I know, but I felt like taking a shift.

5
00:00:56,044 --> 00:00:58,421
You like him, don 't you?
You like watching him.

6
00:00:58,671 --> 00:01:01,724
- Don 't be ridiculous.
- We're gonna kill him. You understand?

7
00:01:01,924 --> 00:01:04,427
Morpheus believes he is the One.

8
00:01:04,677 --> 00:01:05,553
Do you?

9
00:01:05,803 --> 00:01:07,597
It doesn 't matter what I believe.

10
00:01:07,847 --> 00:01:09,474
You don 't, do you?

11
00:01:09,724 --> 00:01:12,010
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?

12
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,644
Are you sure this line is clean?

13
00:01:13,895 --> 00:01:15,897
Yeah, of course I'm sure.

14
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,690
I better go.

15
00:01:55,645 --> 00:01:57,950
- Freeze! Police!
- Hands on your head!

16
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,065
Do it! Do it now!

17
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,600


18
00:02:20,461 --> 00:02:21,796
Lieutenant.

19
00:02:22,088 --> 00:02:23,089
Oh, shit.

20
00:02:23,923 --> 00:02:27,135
Lieutenant, you were given
specific orders.

21
00:02:27,385 --> 00:02:29,095
I'm just doing my job.

22
00:02:29,721 --> 00:02:34,400
You give me that "juris-my-dick-tion"
crap, you can cram it up your ass.

23
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,103
The orders were for your protection.

24
00:02:38,604 --> 00:02:40,815
I think we can handle one little girl.

25
00:02:45,945 --> 00:02:47,697
I sent two units!

26
00:02:47,947 --> 00:02:49,532
They're bringing her down now!

27
00:02:49,782 --> 00:02:52,910
No, Lieutenant, your men
are already dead.

28
00:03:22,315 --> 00:03:23,149
Shit.

29
00:03:25,693 --> 00:03:28,071
Morpheus, the line was traced.
I don't know how.

30
00:03:28,321 --> 00:03:29,906
I know. They cut the hard line.

31
00:03:30,156 --> 00:03:32,325
There's no time.
Get to another exit.

32
00:03:32,575 --> 00:03:33,951
Are there any agents?

33
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:34,994
Yes.

34
00:03:35,203 --> 00:03:36,371
Goddamn it.

35
00:03:36,621 --> 00:03:38,164
You have to focus, Trinity.

36
00:03:38,414 --> 00:03:40,792
There's a phone at Wells and Lake.

37
00:03:41,167 --> 00:03:42,835
You can make it.

38
00:03:43,086 --> 00:03:44,930
- All right.
- Go.

39
00:04:46,899 --> 00:04:47,942
That's impossible.

40
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:25,370
Get up, Trinity.
Just get up.

41
00:05:25,605 --> 00:05:26,814
Get up.

42
00:06:12,694 --> 00:06:14,195
She got out.

43
00:06:14,487 --> 00:06:15,780
It doesn't matter.

44
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:19,450
The informant is real.

45
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:21,119
We have the name of their next target.

46
00:06:21,369 --> 00:06:23,037
The name is Neo.

47
00:06:26,332 --> 00:06:27,834
We'll need a search running.

48
00:06:28,126 --> 00:06:30,044
It has already begun.

49
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,870


50
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,910


51
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,550


52
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:15,570


53
00:07:24,807 --> 00:07:26,017
What?

54
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,450


55
00:07:31,773 --> 00:07:33,274
What the hell?

56
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:40,730


57
00:07:40,907 --> 00:07:42,867
"Follow the white rabbit."

58
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,440


59
00:07:54,712 --> 00:07:55,880
Who is it?

60
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:57,423
It's Choi.

61
00:08:10,937 --> 00:08:12,105
You're two hours late.

62
00:08:12,689 --> 00:08:14,440
I know. It's her fault.

63
00:08:14,732 --> 00:08:15,692
You got the money?

64
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:18,987
Two grand.

65
00:08:19,862 --> 00:08:20,989
Hold on.

66
00:08:38,673 --> 00:08:40,049
Hallelujah.

67
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:43,228
You're my savior.
My own personal Jesus Christ.

68
00:08:43,428 --> 00:08:45,304
You get caught using that...

69
00:08:45,555 --> 00:08:47,682
I know. This never happened.
You don't exist.

70
00:08:48,808 --> 00:08:49,570
- Right.
- Something wrong, man?

71
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:53,710
You look a little whiter than usual.

72
00:08:54,313 --> 00:08:56,482
My computer, it...

73
00:08:59,485 --> 00:09:04,820
Ever have that feeling where you're
not sure if you're awake or dreaming?

74
00:09:04,824 --> 00:09:07,577
All the time.
It's called mescaline.

75
00:09:08,077 --> 00:09:10,204
It's the only way to fly.

76
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,583
It just sounds like you
need to unplug.

77
00:09:14,334 --> 00:09:16,377
Get some R and R?

78
00:09:16,753 --> 00:09:20,506
What do you think, Dujour?
Should we take him with us?

79
00:09:22,508 --> 00:09:23,718
Definitely.

80
00:09:23,968 --> 00:09:27,138
No, I can't. I have work tomorrow.

81
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,806
Come on.

82
00:09:29,057 --> 00:09:31,684
It'll be fun. I promise.

83
00:09:38,191 --> 00:09:39,692
Yeah.

84
00:09:40,526 --> 00:09:42,403
Sure. I'll go.

85
00:10:10,098 --> 00:10:11,057
Hello, Neo.

86
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,559
How do you know that name?

87
00:10:14,394 --> 00:10:16,104
I know a lot about you.

88
00:10:16,979 --> 00:10:17,814
Who are you?

89
00:10:18,064 --> 00:10:19,065
My name is Trinity.

90
00:10:20,024 --> 00:10:21,234
Trinity.

91
00:10:23,027 --> 00:10:24,028
The Trinity?

92
00:10:24,487 --> 00:10:26,197
That cracked the IRS D-base?

93
00:10:26,447 --> 00:10:27,907
That was a long time ago.

94
00:10:28,157 --> 00:10:28,992
Jesus.

95
00:10:29,242 --> 00:10:30,076
What?

96
00:10:30,535 --> 00:10:32,328
I just thought...

97
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,248
...you were a guy.

98
00:10:35,498 --> 00:10:36,958
Most guys do.

99
00:10:38,167 --> 00:10:40,378
That was you on my computer.

100
00:10:41,004 --> 00:10:42,130
How did you do that?

101
00:10:42,755 --> 00:10:45,466
Right now, all I can tell you...

102
00:10:46,092 --> 00:10:47,635
...is that you're in danger.

103
00:10:48,094 --> 00:10:50,950
- I brought you here to warn you.
- Of what?

104
00:10:51,097 --> 00:10:52,765
They're watching you, Neo.

105
00:10:53,349 --> 00:10:54,183
Who is?

106
00:10:54,392 --> 00:10:55,768
Please just listen.

107
00:10:59,272 --> 00:11:01,107
I know why you're here, Neo.

108
00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:03,860
I know what you've been doing.

109
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,987
I know why you hardly sleep...

110
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:09,407
...why you live alone and why,
night after night...

111
00:11:09,657 --> 00:11:11,993
...you sit at your computer.

112
00:11:13,161 --> 00:11:14,704
You're looking for him.

113
00:11:15,496 --> 00:11:18,499
I know, because I was once
looking for the same thing.

114
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,127
And when he found me...

115
00:11:21,753 --> 00:11:24,839
...he told me I wasn't really
looking for him...

116
00:11:25,757 --> 00:11:27,508
...I was looking for an answer.

117
00:11:28,134 --> 00:11:31,262
It's the question that drives us, Neo.

118
00:11:31,929 --> 00:11:34,599
It's the question
that brought you here.

119
00:11:36,684 --> 00:11:38,061
You know the question...

120
00:11:38,311 --> 00:11:39,812
...just as I did.

121
00:11:41,356 --> 00:11:42,982
What is the Matrix?

122
00:11:43,232 --> 00:11:45,693
The answer is out there, Neo.

123
00:11:46,361 --> 00:11:48,363
It's looking for you.

124
00:11:49,155 --> 00:11:50,865
And it will find you...

125
00:11:51,115 --> 00:11:53,117
...if you want it to.

126
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:00,750
Shit.

127
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,251
Shit, shit.

128
00:12:12,512 --> 00:12:15,348
You have a problem with authority,
Mr. Anderson.

129
00:12:15,598 --> 00:12:20,240
You believe that you are special,
that the rules do not apply to you.

130
00:12:20,353 --> 00:12:22,355
Obviously, you are mistaken.

131
00:12:25,316 --> 00:12:28,194
This is one of the top
software companies in the world...

132
00:12:28,444 --> 00:12:31,823
...because employees understand
they are part of a whole.

133
00:12:32,073 --> 00:12:36,703
Thus, if an employee has a problem,
the company has a problem.

134
00:12:38,955 --> 00:12:42,700
The time has come to make
a choice, Mr. Anderson.

135
00:12:43,042 --> 00:12:46,921
Either you choose to be at your desk
on time from this day forth...

136
00:12:47,547 --> 00:12:50,133
...or you choose to find another job.

137
00:12:51,009 --> 00:12:52,343
Do I make myself clear?

138
00:12:52,593 --> 00:12:55,013
Yes, Mr. Rhineheart.
Perfectly clear.

139
00:13:03,479 --> 00:13:04,313
Thomas Anderson?

140
00:13:06,607 --> 00:13:08,026
Yeah, that's me.

141
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:10,630


142
00:13:16,034 --> 00:13:17,201
Great.

143
00:13:18,619 --> 00:13:19,787
Have a nice day.

144
00:13:36,596 --> 00:13:39,932
Hello, Neo. Do you know who this is?

145
00:13:42,185 --> 00:13:42,970
- Morpheus.
- Yes.

146
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:46,189
I've been looking for you.

147
00:13:46,439 --> 00:13:49,609
I don 't know if you're ready to see
what I want to show you.

148
00:13:49,859 --> 00:13:53,029
But unfortunately, you and I
have run out of time.

149
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,041
They're coming for you, and I don 't know
what they're going to do.

150
00:13:57,241 --> 00:13:58,576
Who's coming for me?

151
00:13:58,826 --> 00:14:00,912
Stand up and see for yourself.

152
00:14:01,162 --> 00:14:02,664
What? Right now?

153
00:14:02,955 --> 00:14:03,956
Yes.

154
00:14:04,207 --> 00:14:05,458
Now.

155
00:14:06,334 --> 00:14:08,211
Do it slowly.

156
00:14:08,628 --> 00:14:09,837
The elevator.

157
00:14:14,717 --> 00:14:16,511
Oh, shit!

158
00:14:21,182 --> 00:14:22,183
What do they want?

159
00:14:22,433 --> 00:14:26,260
I don 't know. If you don 't want
to find out, get out of there.

160
00:14:26,354 --> 00:14:26,979
How?

161
00:14:27,188 --> 00:14:30,358
I can guide you,
but you must do exactly as I say.

162
00:14:31,234 --> 00:14:33,310
The cubicle across from you is empty.

163
00:14:36,364 --> 00:14:38,491
- But what if they...
- Go. Now.

164
00:14:45,248 --> 00:14:47,625
Stay here for just a moment.

165
00:14:54,841 --> 00:14:56,770
When I tell you,
go to the end of the row...

166
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:59,980
...to the office
at the end of the hall.

167
00:15:00,054 --> 00:15:02,432
Stay as low as you can.

168
00:15:04,851 --> 00:15:05,852
Go. Now.

169
00:15:20,241 --> 00:15:23,786
Good. Now, outside
there is a scaffold.

170
00:15:26,497 --> 00:15:28,883
- How do you know this?
- We don 't have time.

171
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:31,919
To your left there's a window.
Go to it.

172
00:15:34,172 --> 00:15:35,715
Open it.

173
00:15:36,549 --> 00:15:38,343
Take the scaffold to the roof.

174
00:15:38,593 --> 00:15:41,179
No way! No way!
This is crazy!

175
00:15:41,429 --> 00:15:43,806
There are two ways
out of this building.

176
00:15:44,057 --> 00:15:47,852
One is that scaffold.
The other is in their custody.

177
00:15:48,102 --> 00:15:51,314
You take a chance either way.
I leave it to you.

178
00:15:54,901 --> 00:15:56,653
This is insane!

179
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,697
Why is this happening to me?

180
00:15:59,989 --> 00:16:01,616
What'd I do?

181
00:16:01,991 --> 00:16:04,744
I'm nobody.
I didn't do anything.

182
00:16:05,328 --> 00:16:06,788
I'm gonna die.

183
00:16:16,589 --> 00:16:17,632
Shit!

184
00:16:37,902 --> 00:16:39,028
Oh, shit!

185
00:16:43,992 --> 00:16:45,785
I can't do this.

186
00:16:58,631 --> 00:16:59,465
Shit.

187
00:17:48,723 --> 00:17:54,510
As you can see, we've had our eye
on you for some time now, Mr. Anderson.

188
00:17:54,854 --> 00:17:57,523
It seems that you've been living...

189
00:17:57,774 --> 00:17:59,901
...two lives.

190
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:03,821
In one life,
you're Thomas A. Anderson...

191
00:18:04,072 --> 00:18:07,408
...program writer for
a respectable software company.

192
00:18:08,451 --> 00:18:11,746
You have a social security number.
You pay your taxes.

193
00:18:12,205 --> 00:18:13,456
And you...

194
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:18,670
...help your landlady
carry out her garbage.

195
00:18:21,172 --> 00:18:24,300
The other life is lived in computers...

196
00:18:24,592 --> 00:18:27,553
...where you go by
the hacker alias "Neo"...

197
00:18:27,804 --> 00:18:33,860
...and are guilty of virtually every
computer crime we have a law for.

198
00:18:33,893 --> 00:18:35,853
One of these lives...

199
00:18:36,104 --> 00:18:37,939
...has a future.

200
00:18:38,272 --> 00:18:40,274
And one of them does not.

201
00:18:43,987 --> 00:18:47,824
I'm going to be as forthcoming
as I can be, Mr. Anderson.

202
00:18:48,825 --> 00:18:50,159
You're here...

203
00:18:50,493 --> 00:18:52,745
...because we need your help.

204
00:18:56,374 --> 00:18:59,377
We know that you've been contacted
by a certain...

205
00:18:59,627 --> 00:19:01,421
...individual.

206
00:19:02,338 --> 00:19:06,384
A man who calls himself "Morpheus."

207
00:19:07,385 --> 00:19:11,389
Whatever you think you know
about this man is irrelevant.

208
00:19:11,639 --> 00:19:14,058
He is considered by many authorities...

209
00:19:14,308 --> 00:19:17,630
...to be the most dangerous man alive.

210
00:19:20,106 --> 00:19:21,316
My colleagues...

211
00:19:21,733 --> 00:19:24,652
...believe that I am wasting
my time with you.

212
00:19:24,944 --> 00:19:28,364
But I believe you wish
to do the right thing.

213
00:19:28,656 --> 00:19:32,160
We're willing to wipe the slate clean...

214
00:19:32,535 --> 00:19:34,662
...give you a fresh start.

215
00:19:35,163 --> 00:19:38,082
All we're asking in return
is your cooperation...

216
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:41,836
...in bringing
a known terrorist to justice.

217
00:19:43,212 --> 00:19:44,464
Yeah.

218
00:19:45,757 --> 00:19:47,842
That sounds like a really good deal.

219
00:19:49,469 --> 00:19:51,220
But I got a better one.

220
00:19:51,471 --> 00:19:52,972
How about...

221
00:19:53,389 --> 00:19:55,391
...I give you the finger...

222
00:19:57,977 --> 00:20:00,021
...and you give me my phone call.

223
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:04,025
Mr. Anderson...

224
00:20:08,404 --> 00:20:09,238
...you disappoint me.

225
00:20:09,489 --> 00:20:12,116
You can't scare me
with this gestapo crap.

226
00:20:12,367 --> 00:20:13,743
I know my rights.

227
00:20:13,993 --> 00:20:15,495
I want my phone call.

228
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:18,247
Tell me, Mr. Anderson...

229
00:20:19,123 --> 00:20:20,541
...what good is a phone call...

230
00:20:20,792 --> 00:20:25,360
...if you're unable to speak?

231
00:20:58,162 --> 00:21:00,373
You're going to help us,
Mr. Anderson...

232
00:21:01,082 --> 00:21:02,041
...whether you want to...

233
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:03,167
...or not.

234
00:22:01,476 --> 00:22:04,729
This line is tapped,
so I must be brief.

235
00:22:04,979 --> 00:22:09,275
They got to you first, but they've
underestimated how important you are.

236
00:22:09,525 --> 00:22:11,361
If they knew what I know...

237
00:22:11,611 --> 00:22:13,613
...you would probably be dead.

238
00:22:14,614 --> 00:22:18,376
What are you talking about?
What is happening to me?

239
00:22:18,576 --> 00:22:23,465
You are the One, Neo. You may have
spent the last few years...

240
00:22:23,665 --> 00:22:26,626
...looking for me, but I've spent
my entire life...

241
00:22:26,876 --> 00:22:28,378
...looking for you.

242
00:22:29,921 --> 00:22:32,090
Now, do you still want to meet?

243
00:22:33,049 --> 00:22:36,090
- Yes.
- Then go to the Adams Street bridge.

244
00:22:46,145 --> 00:22:47,355
Get in.

245
00:22:59,617 --> 00:23:00,451
What's this?

246
00:23:00,702 --> 00:23:03,246
It's necessary, Neo.
For our protection.

247
00:23:03,496 --> 00:23:04,497
From what?

248
00:23:04,747 --> 00:23:05,665
From you.

249
00:23:07,208 --> 00:23:07,860
Take off your shirt.

250
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:08,968


251
00:23:09,168 --> 00:23:10,003
Stop the car.

252
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:15,758
Listen, coppertop.

253
00:23:16,009 --> 00:23:18,011
We don't have time for 20 Questions.

254
00:23:18,511 --> 00:23:20,888
Right now, there's only one rule:

255
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,515
Our way...

256
00:23:22,849 --> 00:23:23,933
...or the highway.

257
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:31,566
Fine.

258
00:23:33,443 --> 00:23:35,960
Please, Neo, you have to trust me.

259
00:23:36,487 --> 00:23:39,666
- Why?
- Because you have been down there.

260
00:23:39,866 --> 00:23:41,075
You know that road.

261
00:23:42,076 --> 00:23:43,745
You know exactly where it ends.

262
00:23:45,913 --> 00:23:48,166
And I know that's
not where you want to be.

263
00:24:02,347 --> 00:24:03,890
Apoc, lights.

264
00:24:06,392 --> 00:24:08,561
Lie back.
Lift up your shirt.

265
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,314
What's that?

266
00:24:11,648 --> 00:24:12,732
You're bugged.

267
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:21,949
Try and relax.

268
00:24:28,247 --> 00:24:29,415
Come on.

269
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:31,501
Come on.

270
00:24:33,294 --> 00:24:34,212
It's on the move.

271
00:24:36,047 --> 00:24:37,256
Come on, you shit.

272
00:24:39,092 --> 00:24:41,386
- You're gonna lose it.
- No, I'm not.

273
00:24:41,636 --> 00:24:42,595
Clear!

274
00:24:51,187 --> 00:24:53,314
Jesus Christ!
That thing's real?!

275
00:25:27,056 --> 00:25:28,391
This is it.

276
00:25:31,728 --> 00:25:34,188
Let me give you one piece of advice.

277
00:25:35,148 --> 00:25:36,816
Be honest.

278
00:25:38,401 --> 00:25:40,611
He knows more than you can imagine.

279
00:25:49,329 --> 00:25:50,663
At last.

280
00:25:52,206 --> 00:25:53,291
Welcome, Neo.

281
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,419
As you no doubt have guessed...

282
00:25:56,669 --> 00:25:57,920
...I am Morpheus.

283
00:25:58,963 --> 00:26:00,548
It's an honor to meet you.

284
00:26:01,007 --> 00:26:02,050
No...

285
00:26:02,633 --> 00:26:03,926
...the honor is mine.

286
00:26:04,844 --> 00:26:07,840
Please, come. Sit.

287
00:26:22,445 --> 00:26:24,072
I imagine...

288
00:26:24,489 --> 00:26:28,730
...that right now you're feeling
a bit like Alice...

289
00:26:28,951 --> 00:26:31,371
...tumbling down the rabbit hole?

290
00:26:32,288 --> 00:26:33,289
You could say that.

291
00:26:34,207 --> 00:26:36,834
I can see it in your eyes.

292
00:26:37,418 --> 00:26:40,713
You have the look of a man
who accepts what he sees...

293
00:26:40,963 --> 00:26:43,216
...because he's expecting to wake up.

294
00:26:44,634 --> 00:26:47,261
Ironically, this is not
far from the truth.

295
00:26:47,929 --> 00:26:50,431
Do you believe in fate, Neo?

296
00:26:50,723 --> 00:26:51,599
No.

297
00:26:52,058 --> 00:26:53,017
Why not?

298
00:26:53,267 --> 00:26:56,062
I don't like the idea that
I'm not in control of my life.

299
00:26:57,146 --> 00:27:00,483
I know exactly what you mean.

300
00:27:04,779 --> 00:27:07,156
Let me tell you why you're here.

301
00:27:08,199 --> 00:27:09,742
You know something.

302
00:27:10,284 --> 00:27:11,911
What you know,
you can't explain.

303
00:27:12,412 --> 00:27:13,997
But you feel it.

304
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,499
You felt it your entire life.

305
00:27:17,083 --> 00:27:20,120
Something's wrong with the world.
You don't know what, but it's there.

306
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,965
Like a splinter in your mind...

307
00:27:24,215 --> 00:27:26,092
...driving you mad.

308
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:29,762
It is this feeling
that has brought you to me.

309
00:27:32,306 --> 00:27:34,142
Do you know what
I'm talking about?

310
00:27:35,977 --> 00:27:37,312
The Matrix?

311
00:27:39,814 --> 00:27:41,482
Do you want to know...

312
00:27:41,941 --> 00:27:43,943
...what it is?

313
00:27:46,321 --> 00:27:48,197
The Matrix is everywhere.

314
00:27:48,448 --> 00:27:50,158
It is all around us.

315
00:27:50,408 --> 00:27:52,368
Even now, in this very room.

316
00:27:53,202 --> 00:27:55,413
You can see it when you
look out your window...

317
00:27:55,663 --> 00:27:57,999
...or when you turn on your television.

318
00:27:58,416 --> 00:28:00,960
You can feel it when you go to work...

319
00:28:02,503 --> 00:28:04,172
...when you go to church...

320
00:28:04,589 --> 00:28:06,674
...when you pay your taxes.

321
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,720
It is the world that has been
pulled over your eyes...

322
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:12,555
...to blind you from the truth.

323
00:28:14,766 --> 00:28:16,017
What truth?

324
00:28:20,271 --> 00:28:21,814
That you are a slave.

325
00:28:23,316 --> 00:28:25,610
Like everyone else,
you were born into bondage...

326
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:30,531
...born into a prison that you cannot
smell or taste or touch.

327
00:28:30,823 --> 00:28:32,116
A prison...

328
00:28:32,367 --> 00:28:33,534
...for your mind.

329
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,835
Unfortunately, no one can be...

330
00:28:43,169 --> 00:28:45,546
...told what the Matrix is.

331
00:28:49,008 --> 00:28:50,885
You have to see it for yourself.

332
00:29:00,395 --> 00:29:02,689
This is your last chance.

333
00:29:02,939 --> 00:29:05,274
After this, there is no turning back.

334
00:29:05,733 --> 00:29:07,235
You take the blue pill...

335
00:29:07,527 --> 00:29:10,571
...the story ends, you wake up
in your bed and believe...

336
00:29:10,822 --> 00:29:12,615
...whatever you want to believe.

337
00:29:12,865 --> 00:29:14,200
You take the red pill...

338
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:16,411
...you stay in Wonderland...

339
00:29:16,911 --> 00:29:19,622
...and I show you how deep
the rabbit hole goes.

340
00:29:29,507 --> 00:29:30,717
Remember...

341
00:29:31,551 --> 00:29:34,595
...all I'm offering is the truth.
Nothing more.

342
00:29:48,901 --> 00:29:50,236
Follow me.

343
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,449
Apoc, are we on-line?

344
00:29:54,699 --> 00:29:56,075
Almost.

345
00:29:59,412 --> 00:30:01,456
Time is always against us.

346
00:30:01,831 --> 00:30:03,333
Please take a seat there.

347
00:30:21,517 --> 00:30:23,227
You did all this?

348
00:30:27,357 --> 00:30:29,359
The pill you took is
part of a trace program.

349
00:30:30,109 --> 00:30:34,739
It disrupts your carrier signals
so we can pinpoint your location.

350
00:30:35,281 --> 00:30:36,324
What does that mean?

351
00:30:36,908 --> 00:30:39,077
It means buckle your
seat belt, Dorothy...

352
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:40,745
...because Kansas...

353
00:30:40,995 --> 00:30:42,038
...is going bye-bye.

354
00:31:19,951 --> 00:31:21,327
Did you...?

355
00:31:32,338 --> 00:31:36,426
Have you ever had a dream, Neo,
that you were so sure was real?

356
00:31:37,885 --> 00:31:40,471
What if you were unable
to wake from that dream?

357
00:31:40,722 --> 00:31:43,224
How would you know the difference
between the dream world...

358
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:45,268
...and the real world?

359
00:31:46,894 --> 00:31:48,104
This can't be.

360
00:31:48,354 --> 00:31:49,272
Be what?

361
00:31:49,981 --> 00:31:51,482
Be real?

362
00:31:55,445 --> 00:31:56,738
Going into replication.

363
00:31:57,196 --> 00:31:58,072
Still nothing.

364
00:31:58,656 --> 00:31:59,866
It's cold.

365
00:32:00,116 --> 00:32:01,492
It's cold!

366
00:32:05,371 --> 00:32:07,040
Tank, we'll need a signal soon.

367
00:32:08,583 --> 00:32:09,417
I got a fibrillation.

368
00:32:09,667 --> 00:32:11,210
Apoc, location.

369
00:32:11,461 --> 00:32:12,920
Targeting almost there.

370
00:32:16,215 --> 00:32:17,633
He's going into arrest.

371
00:32:17,884 --> 00:32:18,718
Lock. I got him!

372
00:32:18,926 --> 00:32:20,386
Now, Tank, now!

373
00:35:17,647 --> 00:35:18,731
Welcome...

374
00:35:19,065 --> 00:35:20,984
...to the real world.

375
00:35:22,402 --> 00:35:24,237
We've done it, Trinity.

376
00:35:24,487 --> 00:35:26,030
We found him.

377
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:29,075
- I hope you're right.
- I don't have to hope.

378
00:35:29,659 --> 00:35:31,244
I know it.

379
00:35:36,416 --> 00:35:37,458
Am I dead?

380
00:35:37,959 --> 00:35:40,128
Far from it.

381
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,518
He still needs a lot of work.

382
00:35:57,061 --> 00:35:58,146
What are you doing?

383
00:35:58,396 --> 00:36:00,606
Your muscles atrophied.
We're rebuilding them.

384
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,734
Why do my eyes hurt?

385
00:36:03,443 --> 00:36:05,320
You've never used them before.

386
00:36:09,282 --> 00:36:10,116
Rest, Neo.

387
00:36:10,366 --> 00:36:12,035
The answers are coming.

388
00:37:26,609 --> 00:37:28,194
Morpheus, what's happened to me?

389
00:37:28,945 --> 00:37:29,904
What is this place?

390
00:37:30,154 --> 00:37:32,824
More important than "what" is "when."

391
00:37:33,533 --> 00:37:34,367
When?

392
00:37:34,575 --> 00:37:36,619
You believe it's the year 1999...

393
00:37:36,869 --> 00:37:39,122
...when in fact, it's closer to 2199.

394
00:37:40,248 --> 00:37:43,001
I can't tell you exactly
what year it is...

395
00:37:43,251 --> 00:37:44,877
...because we honestly don't know.

396
00:37:45,378 --> 00:37:48,214
There's nothing I can say
that will explain it for you.

397
00:37:48,464 --> 00:37:49,632
Come with me.

398
00:37:49,924 --> 00:37:51,217
See for yourself.

399
00:37:51,759 --> 00:37:53,511
This is my ship.

400
00:37:53,803 --> 00:37:56,723
The Nebuchadnezzar.
It's a hovercraft.

401
00:37:59,559 --> 00:38:01,311
This is the main deck.

402
00:38:07,317 --> 00:38:08,318
This is the core...

403
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:10,800


404
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:14,574
...where we broadcast our pirate signal
and hack into the Matrix.

405
00:38:17,952 --> 00:38:21,122
Most of my crew you already know.

406
00:38:26,127 --> 00:38:27,545
This is Apoc...

407
00:38:28,338 --> 00:38:29,672
...Switch...

408
00:38:31,257 --> 00:38:32,425
...and Cypher.

409
00:38:32,675 --> 00:38:37,110
The ones you don't know:
Tank and his big brother, Dozer.

410
00:38:37,263 --> 00:38:39,682
The little one behind you is Mouse.

411
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:47,273
You wanted to know
what the Matrix is?

412
00:38:48,316 --> 00:38:49,525
Trinity.

413
00:39:10,546 --> 00:39:12,131
Try to relax.

414
00:39:17,011 --> 00:39:18,846
This will feel a little weird.

415
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,590


416
00:39:30,817 --> 00:39:31,985
This...

417
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,070
...is the Construct.

418
00:39:34,487 --> 00:39:36,614
It's our loading program.

419
00:39:36,864 --> 00:39:38,350
We can load anything, from clothing...

420
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:41,110
...to equipment...

421
00:39:41,244 --> 00:39:42,578
...weapons...

422
00:39:43,204 --> 00:39:45,039
...training simulations...

423
00:39:45,415 --> 00:39:47,959
...anything we need.

424
00:39:50,753 --> 00:39:53,172
Right now we're inside
a computer program?

425
00:39:53,464 --> 00:39:55,383
Is it really so hard to believe?

426
00:39:55,883 --> 00:39:58,511
Your clothes are different.
The plugs in your body are gone.

427
00:39:59,721 --> 00:40:01,806
Your hair has changed.

428
00:40:02,181 --> 00:40:05,518
Your appearance now is what we call
"residual self-image."

429
00:40:06,227 --> 00:40:08,855
It is the mental projection
of your digital self.

430
00:40:14,736 --> 00:40:15,862
This isn't real?

431
00:40:16,112 --> 00:40:17,655
What is "real"?

432
00:40:18,031 --> 00:40:20,283
How do you define "real"?

433
00:40:20,575 --> 00:40:22,493
If you're talking about
what you can feel...

434
00:40:22,744 --> 00:40:25,163
...what you can smell, taste and see...

435
00:40:25,413 --> 00:40:29,292
...then "real" is simply electrical
signals interpreted by your brain.

436
00:40:33,463 --> 00:40:35,882
This is the world that you know.

437
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:40,345
The world as it was at the end
of the 20th century.

438
00:40:42,722 --> 00:40:47,060
It exists now only as part of
a neural-interactive simulation...

439
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:48,561
...that we call the Matrix.

440
00:40:53,107 --> 00:40:55,943
You've been living
in a dream world, Neo.

441
00:40:56,903 --> 00:40:58,029
This is the world...

442
00:40:58,321 --> 00:41:00,114
...as it exists today.

443
00:41:13,127 --> 00:41:16,089
Welcome to "the desert...

444
00:41:16,964 --> 00:41:18,549
...of the real."

445
00:41:21,928 --> 00:41:24,305
We have only bits and pieces
of information.

446
00:41:24,555 --> 00:41:28,351
But what we know for certain
is that in the early 21 st century...

447
00:41:28,601 --> 00:41:31,905
...all of mankind was united
in celebration.

448
00:41:32,105 --> 00:41:36,859
We marveled at our own magnificence
as we gave birth to Al.

449
00:41:37,652 --> 00:41:38,778
£Á£É£¿
Al.

450
00:41:39,821 --> 00:41:41,197
You mean artificial intelligence.

451
00:41:41,447 --> 00:41:45,868
A singular consciousness that spawned
an entire race of machines.

452
00:41:46,703 --> 00:41:50,164
We don't know who struck first,
us or them.

453
00:41:50,581 --> 00:41:53,793
But we know that it was us
that scorched the sky.

454
00:41:55,461 --> 00:41:57,630
They were dependent on solar power...

455
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:01,217
...and it was believed that
they would be unable to survive...

456
00:42:01,551 --> 00:42:05,054
...without an energy source
as abundant as the sun.

457
00:42:05,305 --> 00:42:10,690
Throughout human history, we have been
dependent on machines to survive.

458
00:42:11,644 --> 00:42:15,857
Fate, it seems, is not
without a sense of irony.

459
00:42:19,068 --> 00:42:23,540
The human body generates more
bioelectricity than a 120-volt battery.

460
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:27,869
And over 25,000 BTUs of body heat.

461
00:42:29,787 --> 00:42:31,956
Combined with a form of fusion...

462
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:37,128
...the machines had found all the energy
they would ever need.

463
00:42:41,174 --> 00:42:44,927
There are fields, Neo,
endless fields...

464
00:42:45,178 --> 00:42:48,431
...where human beings
are no longer born.

465
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,975
We are grown.

466
00:42:57,023 --> 00:42:59,609
For the longest time,
I wouldn't believe it.

467
00:42:59,859 --> 00:43:02,528
And then I saw the fields
with my own eyes...

468
00:43:03,863 --> 00:43:05,490
...watched them liquefy the dead...

469
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:09,077
...so they could be fed intravenously
to the living.

470
00:43:09,619 --> 00:43:13,873
And standing there,
facing the pure, horrifying precision...

471
00:43:14,123 --> 00:43:17,043
...I came to realize
the obviousness of the truth.

472
00:43:19,671 --> 00:43:21,464
What is the Matrix?

473
00:43:22,674 --> 00:43:23,716
Control.

474
00:43:25,093 --> 00:43:28,471
The Matrix is a computer-generated
dream world...

475
00:43:29,263 --> 00:43:32,350
...built to keep us under control...

476
00:43:33,518 --> 00:43:36,688
...in order to change a human being...

477
00:43:37,313 --> 00:43:38,481
...into this.

478
00:43:39,857 --> 00:43:40,984
No.

479
00:43:42,610 --> 00:43:44,195
I don't believe it.

480
00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:45,780
It's not possible.

481
00:43:46,364 --> 00:43:51,002
I didn't say it would be easy, Neo.
I just said it would be the truth.

482
00:43:51,202 --> 00:43:52,036
Stop!

483
00:43:53,037 --> 00:43:54,247
Let me out!

484
00:43:54,956 --> 00:43:56,874
Let me out! I want out!

485
00:43:58,835 --> 00:44:01,554
- Easy, Neo. Easy.
- Get this thing out of me.

486
00:44:01,754 --> 00:44:03,423
Get this thing out of me!

487
00:44:05,216 --> 00:44:06,718
Don't touch me!

488
00:44:06,968 --> 00:44:08,594
Stay away from me!

489
00:44:09,012 --> 00:44:10,513
I don't believe it.

490
00:44:11,222 --> 00:44:12,432
I don't believe it.

491
00:44:12,682 --> 00:44:13,683
I don't believe it.

492
00:44:14,434 --> 00:44:15,630
- He's gonna pop.
- Breathe, Neo.

493
00:44:15,830 --> 00:44:18,890
Just breathe.

494
00:44:36,331 --> 00:44:38,124
I can't go back, can I?

495
00:44:39,083 --> 00:44:40,043
No.

496
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:42,420
But if you could...

497
00:44:43,254 --> 00:44:44,756
...would you really want to?

498
00:44:47,258 --> 00:44:48,676
I owe you an apology.

499
00:44:49,218 --> 00:44:50,595
We have a rule.

500
00:44:51,054 --> 00:44:54,432
We never free a mind
once it's reached a certain age.

501
00:44:54,682 --> 00:44:55,558
It's dangerous.

502
00:44:56,267 --> 00:44:57,977
The mind has trouble letting go.

503
00:44:58,227 --> 00:45:01,560
I've seen it before, and I'm sorry.

504
00:45:01,564 --> 00:45:03,650
I did what I did because...

505
00:45:04,359 --> 00:45:05,818
...I had to.

506
00:45:14,243 --> 00:45:18,331
When the Matrix was first built,
there was a man born inside...

507
00:45:18,831 --> 00:45:22,627
...who had the ability
to change whatever he wanted...

508
00:45:23,002 --> 00:45:25,922
...to remake the Matrix as he saw fit.

509
00:45:27,674 --> 00:45:31,135
It was he who freed the first of us...

510
00:45:32,011 --> 00:45:33,638
...taught us the truth.

511
00:45:35,098 --> 00:45:38,184
As long as the Matrix exists...

512
00:45:38,518 --> 00:45:40,603
...the human race will never be free.

513
00:45:44,816 --> 00:45:46,359
After he died...

514
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:49,821
...the Oracle prophesied his return...

515
00:45:50,363 --> 00:45:53,574
...and that his coming would hail
the destruction of the Matrix...

516
00:45:53,825 --> 00:45:55,493
...end the war...

517
00:45:55,827 --> 00:45:57,036
...bring freedom to our people.

518
00:45:58,413 --> 00:46:03,042
That is why there are those of us who
spent our lives searching the Matrix...

519
00:46:03,376 --> 00:46:04,961
...Iooking for him.

520
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:09,465
I did what I did because...

521
00:46:11,092 --> 00:46:13,219
...I believe that search is over.

522
00:46:18,308 --> 00:46:19,726
Get some rest.

523
00:46:20,351 --> 00:46:22,145
You're going to need it.

524
00:46:25,064 --> 00:46:25,898
For what?

525
00:46:29,152 --> 00:46:30,153
Your training.

526
00:46:48,463 --> 00:46:50,173
Morning. Did you sleep?

527
00:46:51,049 --> 00:46:52,258
You will tonight.

528
00:46:52,633 --> 00:46:54,177
I guarantee it.

529
00:46:55,678 --> 00:46:57,597
I'm Tank. I'll be your operator.

530
00:46:58,056 --> 00:47:01,192
- You don't have any...
- Holes? Nope.

531
00:47:01,392 --> 00:47:06,156
Me and my brother, Dozer, are 100?o pure,
old-fashioned, homegrown human.

532
00:47:06,356 --> 00:47:07,565
Born free right here...

533
00:47:08,107 --> 00:47:09,442
...in the real world.

534
00:47:09,692 --> 00:47:11,361
Genuine child of Zion.

535
00:47:12,195 --> 00:47:13,610
- Zion?
- Lf the war was over tomorrow...

536
00:47:13,810 --> 00:47:16,710
...Zion's where the party would be.

537
00:47:16,824 --> 00:47:18,117
It's a city?

538
00:47:18,368 --> 00:47:21,537
The last human city.
The only place we have left.

539
00:47:23,122 --> 00:47:24,374
Where is it?

540
00:47:26,125 --> 00:47:27,126
Deep underground...

541
00:47:27,377 --> 00:47:29,545
...near the Earth's core,
where it's still warm.

542
00:47:31,172 --> 00:47:33,049
You live long enough,
you might see it.

543
00:47:35,301 --> 00:47:39,160
Goddamn! I gotta tell you, I'm excited
to see what you're capable of...

544
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:42,390
...if Morpheus is right and all.

545
00:47:42,642 --> 00:47:44,140
We're not supposed to
talk about this, but...

546
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:47,670
...if you are...

547
00:47:48,147 --> 00:47:50,149
...it's a very exciting time.

548
00:47:51,192 --> 00:47:53,903
We got a lot to do.
We gotta get to it.

549
00:47:56,410 --> 00:48:01,350
We're supposed to start
with these programs first.

550
00:48:01,744 --> 00:48:03,890
That's major boring shit.
Let's do something more fun.

551
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:07,041
How about...

552
00:48:08,584 --> 00:48:10,336
...combat training?

553
00:48:16,384 --> 00:48:17,844
"Jujitsu"?

554
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,388
I'm going to learn jujitsu?

555
00:48:31,733 --> 00:48:32,942
Holy shit!

556
00:48:33,192 --> 00:48:35,528
"Hey, Mikey, I think he likes it."

557
00:48:35,862 --> 00:48:37,155
How about some more?

558
00:48:37,405 --> 00:48:38,698
Hell, yes.

559
00:48:40,992 --> 00:48:41,826
Hell, yeah.

560
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:43,080


561
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:44,360


562
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,730


563
00:48:54,213 --> 00:48:55,089
How is he?

564
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:57,550
Ten hours straight.
He's a machine.

565
00:49:08,728 --> 00:49:10,104
I know kung fu.

566
00:49:11,981 --> 00:49:12,815
Show me.

567
00:49:14,567 --> 00:49:16,319
This is a sparring program...

568
00:49:16,569 --> 00:49:19,364
...similar to the programmed reality
of the Matrix.

569
00:49:19,614 --> 00:49:21,949
It has the same basic rules.
Like gravity.

570
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:25,662
These rules are no different
than those of a computer system.

571
00:49:26,204 --> 00:49:27,705
Some of them can be bent.

572
00:49:27,914 --> 00:49:28,748
Others...

573
00:49:28,998 --> 00:49:30,375
...can be broken.

574
00:49:31,042 --> 00:49:32,001
Understand?

575
00:49:33,294 --> 00:49:34,170
Then hit me...

576
00:49:34,712 --> 00:49:35,838
...if you can.

577
00:50:14,043 --> 00:50:14,711
Good!

578
00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:16,250


579
00:50:16,629 --> 00:50:17,797
Adaptation.

580
00:50:18,089 --> 00:50:19,298
Improvisation.

581
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:20,925
But your weakness...

582
00:50:21,175 --> 00:50:22,552
...is not your technique.

583
00:50:29,517 --> 00:50:31,602
Morpheus is fighting Neo.

584
00:51:43,883 --> 00:51:45,051
How did I beat you?

585
00:51:51,641 --> 00:51:52,725
You're too fast.

586
00:51:53,267 --> 00:51:54,602
Do you believe that......my being stronger or faster...

587
00:51:57,730 --> 00:52:02,720
...has anything to do
with my muscles in this place?

588
00:52:05,446 --> 00:52:07,240
You think you're breathing air?

589
00:52:20,753 --> 00:52:21,963
Again!

590
00:52:33,433 --> 00:52:35,852
Jesus Christ, he's fast!

591
00:52:36,102 --> 00:52:38,313
His neuro-kinetics
are way above normal.

592
00:52:43,776 --> 00:52:45,236
What are you waiting for?

593
00:52:45,486 --> 00:52:47,447
You're faster than this.

594
00:52:49,657 --> 00:52:51,868
Don't think you are.

595
00:52:52,118 --> 00:52:53,786
Know you are.

596
00:53:04,172 --> 00:53:07,008
Come on! Stop trying to hit me,
and hit me!

597
00:53:16,893 --> 00:53:18,645
I don't believe it.

598
00:53:20,188 --> 00:53:22,315
I know what you're trying to do.

599
00:53:23,983 --> 00:53:26,152
I'm trying to free your mind, Neo.

600
00:53:26,486 --> 00:53:28,571
But I can only show you the door.

601
00:53:29,155 --> 00:53:31,074
You have to walk through it.

602
00:53:33,368 --> 00:53:35,495
Tank, load the jump program.

603
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:50,160
You have to let it all go, Neo.
Fear...

604
00:53:50,343 --> 00:53:52,512
...doubt and disbelief.

605
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:56,391
Free your mind.

606
00:54:12,573 --> 00:54:14,283
Okey-dokey.

607
00:54:16,369 --> 00:54:17,537
Free my mind.

608
00:54:18,121 --> 00:54:19,122
What if he makes it?

609
00:54:19,372 --> 00:54:22,930
- No one's ever made their first jump.
- I know.

610
00:54:23,418 --> 00:54:26,660
- But what if he does?
- He won't.

611
00:54:26,713 --> 00:54:27,547
Come on.

612
00:54:27,797 --> 00:54:28,965
All right.

613
00:54:29,424 --> 00:54:31,467
No problem. Free my mind.

614
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:35,054
Free my mind. No problem. Right.

615
00:54:54,449 --> 00:54:56,117
What does that mean?

616
00:54:56,492 --> 00:54:58,328
It doesn't mean anything.

617
00:54:58,911 --> 00:55:01,497
Everybody falls the first time.

618
00:55:01,956 --> 00:55:03,249
Right, Trin?

619
00:55:23,936 --> 00:55:27,190
- I thought it wasn't real.
- Your mind makes it real.

620
00:55:29,817 --> 00:55:32,070
If you're killed in the Matrix...

621
00:55:32,445 --> 00:55:33,279
...you die here?

622
00:55:33,905 --> 00:55:36,366
The body cannot live without the mind.

623
00:56:06,854 --> 00:56:10,233
I don't remember you ever
bringing me dinner.

624
00:56:13,319 --> 00:56:16,155
There is something about him,
isn't there?

625
00:56:16,781 --> 00:56:18,408
You're a believer now?

626
00:56:19,409 --> 00:56:20,618
I keep wondering...

627
00:56:20,868 --> 00:56:25,290
...if Morpheus is so sure,
why not take him to see the Oracle?

628
00:56:25,456 --> 00:56:28,376
Morpheus will take him
when he's ready.

629
00:56:38,177 --> 00:56:39,721
The Matrix is a system, Neo.

630
00:56:41,472 --> 00:56:42,765
That system is our enemy.

631
00:56:43,391 --> 00:56:45,727
But when you're inside,
what do you see?

632
00:56:45,977 --> 00:56:49,772
Businessmen, teachers,
lawyers, carpenters.

633
00:56:50,231 --> 00:56:52,817
The very minds of the people
we are trying to save.

634
00:56:53,067 --> 00:56:56,029
But until we do, these people are
a part of that system...

635
00:56:56,279 --> 00:56:58,197
...and that makes them our enemy.

636
00:56:58,573 --> 00:56:59,574
You have to understand...

637
00:56:59,824 --> 00:57:03,161
...most of these people are not
ready to be unplugged.

638
00:57:03,411 --> 00:57:04,996
And many of them are so inert...

639
00:57:05,246 --> 00:57:07,665
...so hopelessly dependent
on the system...
...so hopelessly dependent
on the system...

640
00:57:07,915 --> 00:57:10,626
...that they will fight to protect it.

641
00:57:12,128 --> 00:57:15,882
Were you listening to me or looking
at the woman in the red dress?

642
00:57:16,883 --> 00:57:17,800
Look again.

643
00:57:19,052 --> 00:57:20,136
Freeze it.

644
00:57:24,510 --> 00:57:27,580
This isn't the Matrix?

645
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:34,025
It's another training program
designed to teach you one thing:

646
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:37,070
If you are not one of us,
you are one of them.

647
00:57:37,612 --> 00:57:40,690
- What are they?
- Sentient programs.

648
00:57:41,157 --> 00:57:45,628
They can move in and out of any software
still hardwired to their system.

649
00:57:45,828 --> 00:57:49,207
That means that anyone
we haven't unplugged...

650
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:50,875
...is potentially an agent.

651
00:57:51,834 --> 00:57:53,670
Inside the Matrix...

652
00:57:54,253 --> 00:57:55,964
...they are everyone...

653
00:57:56,297 --> 00:57:58,007
...and they are no one.

654
00:57:58,257 --> 00:58:01,436
We have survived by hiding
and running from them...

655
00:58:01,636 --> 00:58:03,262
...but they are the gatekeepers.

656
00:58:03,513 --> 00:58:06,474
They're guarding all the doors
and holding all the keys.

657
00:58:06,724 --> 00:58:09,560
Sooner or later, someone will
have to fight them.

658
00:58:09,936 --> 00:58:10,937
Someone?

659
00:58:11,270 --> 00:58:12,689
I won't lie to you, Neo.

660
00:58:13,147 --> 00:58:18,036
Every single man or woman who
has fought an agent has died.

661
00:58:18,236 --> 00:58:20,613
But where they have failed,
you will succeed.

662
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:21,864
Why?

663
00:58:22,115 --> 00:58:24,409
I've seen an agent punch
through a concrete wall.

664
00:58:24,659 --> 00:58:28,246
Men have emptied entire clips at them
and hit nothing but air.

665
00:58:28,496 --> 00:58:33,126
Yet their strength and speed are still
based in a world built on rules.

666
00:58:33,376 --> 00:58:34,502
Because of that...

667
00:58:34,752 --> 00:58:38,131
...they will never be as strong
or as fast as you can be.

668
00:58:42,427 --> 00:58:44,304
What are you telling me?

669
00:58:45,013 --> 00:58:46,472
That I can dodge bullets?

670
00:58:48,474 --> 00:58:49,851
No, Neo.

671
00:58:50,351 --> 00:58:53,271
I'm trying to tell you
that when you're ready...

672
00:58:54,147 --> 00:58:55,523
...you won't have to.

673
00:59:00,028 --> 00:59:00,862
We got trouble.

674
00:59:19,756 --> 00:59:21,132
Did Zion send the warning?

675
00:59:21,382 --> 00:59:22,216
No, another ship.

676
00:59:25,470 --> 00:59:26,763
Shit.

677
00:59:27,013 --> 00:59:28,765
Squiddy's sweeping in quick.

678
00:59:29,057 --> 00:59:29,891
Squiddy?

679
00:59:30,099 --> 00:59:33,311
A sentinel. A killing machine
designed for one thing.

680
00:59:33,561 --> 00:59:34,771
Search and destroy.

681
00:59:36,105 --> 00:59:37,273
Set her down there.

682
00:59:59,087 --> 01:00:00,046
How are we doing, Tank?

683
01:00:08,763 --> 01:00:09,931
Power off-line.

684
01:00:10,431 --> 01:00:12,433
EMP armed...

685
01:00:12,934 --> 01:00:14,477
...and ready.

686
01:00:14,769 --> 01:00:16,696
£Å£Í£Ð£¿
Electromagnetic pulse.

687
01:00:16,896 --> 01:00:19,774
Disables any electrical system
in the blast radius.

688
01:00:20,024 --> 01:00:22,235
It's the only weapon we have
against the machines.

689
01:00:28,032 --> 01:00:28,866
Where are we?

690
01:00:29,117 --> 01:00:31,160
Their old service and waste systems.

691
01:00:32,704 --> 01:00:33,538
Sewers.

692
01:00:33,746 --> 01:00:36,457
There used to be cities
that spanned hundreds of miles.

693
01:00:36,958 --> 01:00:38,876
Now these sewers are
all that's left.

694
01:00:39,127 --> 01:00:40,461
Quiet.

695
01:01:22,150 --> 01:01:27,320
You scared the bejesus out of me.

696
01:01:27,592 --> 01:01:29,650
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

697
01:01:32,430 --> 01:01:33,264
Is that...?

698
01:01:33,514 --> 01:01:35,099
The Matrix?

699
01:01:35,430 --> 01:01:36,800


700
01:01:38,269 --> 01:01:41,670
- Do you always look at it encoded?
- Well, you have to.

701
01:01:41,689 --> 01:01:44,776
The image translators work
for the construct program.

702
01:01:45,026 --> 01:01:48,446
But there's way too much information
to decode the Matrix.

703
01:01:48,696 --> 01:01:51,658
You get used to it.
I don't even see the code.

704
01:01:51,908 --> 01:01:55,328
All I see is blonde, brunette, redhead.

705
01:01:56,496 --> 01:01:57,872
Do you...

706
01:01:58,164 --> 01:01:59,248
...want a drink?

707
01:01:59,499 --> 01:02:00,541
Sure.

708
01:02:04,087 --> 01:02:05,546
You know...

709
01:02:06,464 --> 01:02:08,007
...I know what you're thinking.

710
01:02:08,257 --> 01:02:10,385
Because right now I'm thinking
the same thing.

711
01:02:10,677 --> 01:02:14,013
Actually, I've been thinking it
ever since I got here.

712
01:02:15,932 --> 01:02:18,935
Why, oh, why didn't I take
the blue pill?

713
01:02:31,322 --> 01:02:33,241
Good shit, huh?

714
01:02:33,574 --> 01:02:34,784
Dozer makes it.

715
01:02:35,243 --> 01:02:36,411
It's good for two things:

716
01:02:36,661 --> 01:02:39,747
Degreasing engines and
killing brain cells.

717
01:02:40,748 --> 01:02:42,959
So can I ask you something?

718
01:02:45,962 --> 01:02:47,588
Did he tell you why he did it?

719
01:02:50,216 --> 01:02:52,051
Why you're here?

720
01:02:55,722 --> 01:02:57,473
Jesus!

721
01:02:58,683 --> 01:03:00,601
What a mind job.

722
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:04,814
So you're here to save the world.

723
01:03:06,316 --> 01:03:08,401
What do you say
to something like that?

724
01:03:13,573 --> 01:03:14,949
A little piece of advice.

725
01:03:16,743 --> 01:03:18,161
You see an agent...

726
01:03:18,494 --> 01:03:20,788
...you do what we do:

727
01:03:21,122 --> 01:03:22,665
Run.

728
01:03:22,999 --> 01:03:24,751
You run your ass off.

729
01:03:32,008 --> 01:03:33,718
Thanks for the drink.

730
01:03:38,431 --> 01:03:39,599
Sweet dreams.

731
01:03:43,603 --> 01:03:47,023
Do we have a deal, Mr. Reagan?

732
01:03:47,690 --> 01:03:48,816
You know...

733
01:03:50,234 --> 01:03:52,695
...I know this steak doesn't exist.

734
01:03:53,696 --> 01:03:56,449
I know that when I put it
in my mouth...

735
01:03:56,699 --> 01:03:58,710
...the Matrix is telling my brain
that it is...

736
01:03:58,910 --> 01:04:01,430
...juicy...

737
01:04:01,496 --> 01:04:03,206
...and delicious.

738
01:04:06,125 --> 01:04:07,377
After nine years...

739
01:04:08,419 --> 01:04:09,963
...you know what I realize?

740
01:04:17,804 --> 01:04:19,013
Ignorance is bliss.

741
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:25,895
Then we have a deal.

742
01:04:28,398 --> 01:04:30,316
I don't want to remember nothing.

743
01:04:30,566 --> 01:04:31,401
Nothing.

744
01:04:31,943 --> 01:04:33,111
You understand?

745
01:04:37,156 --> 01:04:38,950
And I want to be rich.

746
01:04:40,284 --> 01:04:42,996
You know, someone important.

747
01:04:44,497 --> 01:04:45,623
Like an actor.

748
01:04:46,833 --> 01:04:49,961
Whatever you want, Mr. Reagan.

749
01:04:52,130 --> 01:04:53,673
Okay.

750
01:04:54,048 --> 01:04:56,467
You get my body
back in a power plant...

751
01:04:56,843 --> 01:04:58,594
...reinsert me into the Matrix...

752
01:04:58,928 --> 01:05:00,346
...I'll get you what you want.

753
01:05:00,596 --> 01:05:02,598
Access codes to the Zion mainframe.

754
01:05:02,849 --> 01:05:05,018
No. I told you, I don't know them.

755
01:05:07,979 --> 01:05:09,981
I can get you the man who does.

756
01:05:10,732 --> 01:05:12,525
Morpheus.

757
01:05:22,618 --> 01:05:26,080
Here you go, buddy.
Breakfast of champions.

758
01:05:27,415 --> 01:05:30,209
Close your eyes, it feels
like you're eating runny eggs.

759
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:31,294
Or a bowl of snot.

760
01:05:32,670 --> 01:05:34,255
You know what it reminds me of?

761
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:38,830
Tastee Wheat. Did you
ever eat Tastee Wheat?

762
01:05:39,052 --> 01:05:40,762
No, but technically,
neither did you.

763
01:05:41,012 --> 01:05:43,056
That's exactly my point. Exactly.

764
01:05:43,306 --> 01:05:44,682
Because you have to wonder...

765
01:05:44,932 --> 01:05:48,186
...how do the machines really know
what Tastee Wheat tasted like?

766
01:05:48,436 --> 01:05:49,854
Maybe they got it wrong.

767
01:05:50,104 --> 01:05:53,316
Maybe what I think Tastee Wheat
tasted like actually tasted like...

768
01:05:53,608 --> 01:05:55,610
...oatmeal or tuna fish.

769
01:05:55,985 --> 01:05:58,821
That makes you wonder.
Take chicken, for example.

770
01:05:59,072 --> 01:06:01,074
Maybe they didn't know
what to make it taste like...

771
01:06:01,324 --> 01:06:03,368
...which is why it tastes
like everything.

772
01:06:03,618 --> 01:06:05,411
- And maybe they...
- Shut up.

773
01:06:07,038 --> 01:06:08,498
It's a single-celled protein...

774
01:06:08,748 --> 01:06:11,793
...combined with synthetic aminos,
vitamins and minerals.

775
01:06:12,043 --> 01:06:13,294
Everything the body needs.

776
01:06:13,544 --> 01:06:16,422
It doesn't have everything
the body needs.

777
01:06:19,175 --> 01:06:22,261
I understand you've run through
the agent training program.

778
01:06:23,304 --> 01:06:25,348
You know, I wrote that program.

779
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:26,933
Here it comes.

780
01:06:27,183 --> 01:06:29,319
- What did you think of her?
- Of who?

781
01:06:29,519 --> 01:06:32,563
The woman in the red dress.
I designed her.

782
01:06:32,897 --> 01:06:35,650
She doesn't talk very much...

783
01:06:35,900 --> 01:06:39,862
...but if you'd like to meet her,
I can arrange a more personal milieu.

784
01:06:40,113 --> 01:06:41,489
The digital pimp hard at work.

785
01:06:41,739 --> 01:06:43,992
Pay no attention to
these hypocrites, Neo.

786
01:06:45,284 --> 01:06:47,120
To deny our own impulses...

787
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:50,498
...is to deny the very thing
that makes us human.

788
01:06:52,417 --> 01:06:53,793
Dozer, when you're done...

789
01:06:54,043 --> 01:06:55,461
...bring the ship up to broadcast depth.

790
01:06:56,170 --> 01:06:57,505
We're going in.

791
01:06:58,214 --> 01:06:59,632
I'm taking Neo to see her.

792
01:07:03,970 --> 01:07:04,804
See who?

793
01:07:05,805 --> 01:07:07,056
The Oracle.

794
01:07:12,562 --> 01:07:14,105
Everyone, please observe...

795
01:07:14,439 --> 01:07:17,150
...the "fasten seat belt"
and "no smoking" signs are on.

796
01:07:17,650 --> 01:07:21,029
Sit back and enjoy your flight.

797
01:07:43,370 --> 01:07:44,890


798
01:07:45,553 --> 01:07:46,387
We're in.

799
01:08:02,111 --> 01:08:03,237
We'll be back in an hour.

800
01:08:18,044 --> 01:08:19,462
Unbelievable...

801
01:08:20,296 --> 01:08:21,631
...isn't it?

802
01:08:25,218 --> 01:08:27,710
- God!
- What?

803
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:29,097
I used to eat there.

804
01:08:31,349 --> 01:08:32,976
Really good noodles.

805
01:08:37,772 --> 01:08:40,274
I have these memories from my life.

806
01:08:42,735 --> 01:08:44,404
None of them happened.

807
01:08:45,446 --> 01:08:46,364
What does that mean?

808
01:08:46,614 --> 01:08:48,825
That the Matrix cannot tell you
who you are.

809
01:08:49,742 --> 01:08:50,952
But an oracle can?

810
01:08:51,411 --> 01:08:52,620
That's different.

811
01:08:57,709 --> 01:08:58,584
Did you go to her?

812
01:09:00,128 --> 01:09:01,296
Yes.

813
01:09:01,796 --> 01:09:03,172
What did she tell you?

814
01:09:06,426 --> 01:09:07,927
She told me...

815
01:09:08,970 --> 01:09:10,138
What?

816
01:09:13,933 --> 01:09:15,268
We're here.

817
01:09:15,690 --> 01:09:17,937
Come with me.

818
01:09:37,915 --> 01:09:40,585
So is this the same oracle
that made...

819
01:09:40,918 --> 01:09:41,753
...the prophecy?

820
01:09:42,003 --> 01:09:46,341
Yes. She's very old. She's been
with us since the beginning.

821
01:09:46,799 --> 01:09:47,634
The beginning?

822
01:09:47,842 --> 01:09:48,801
Of the Resistance.

823
01:09:51,054 --> 01:09:53,431
And she knows what? Everything?

824
01:09:55,475 --> 01:09:57,393
She would say she knows enough.

825
01:09:58,519 --> 01:10:00,313
And she's never wrong.

826
01:10:02,523 --> 01:10:05,693
Try not to think of it
in terms of right and wrong.

827
01:10:06,027 --> 01:10:07,612
She is a guide, Neo.

828
01:10:07,987 --> 01:10:09,864
She can help you to find the path.

829
01:10:10,657 --> 01:10:11,616
She helped you?

830
01:10:12,310 --> 01:10:13,710


831
01:10:14,118 --> 01:10:15,453
What did she tell you?

832
01:10:17,914 --> 01:10:20,124
That I would find the One.

833
01:10:33,262 --> 01:10:35,390
I told you I can only
show you the door.

834
01:10:36,099 --> 01:10:38,184
You have to walk through it.

835
01:10:41,980 --> 01:10:43,064
Hello, Neo.

836
01:10:43,314 --> 01:10:44,983
You're right on time.

837
01:10:52,907 --> 01:10:56,703
Make yourself at home, Morpheus.
Neo, come with me.

838
01:11:02,375 --> 01:11:03,960
These are the other Potentials.

839
01:11:04,210 --> 01:11:05,753
You can wait here.

840
01:11:46,586 --> 01:11:49,130
Do not try and bend the spoon.

841
01:11:49,505 --> 01:11:51,633
That's impossible.

842
01:11:52,467 --> 01:11:56,471
Instead, only try
to realize the truth.

843
01:11:57,013 --> 01:11:58,389
What truth?

844
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:00,308
There is no spoon.

845
01:12:02,894 --> 01:12:04,228
There is no spoon?

846
01:12:04,479 --> 01:12:08,983
Then you'll see that it is not the spoon
that bends. It is only yourself.

847
01:12:24,999 --> 01:12:26,501
The Oracle will you see now.

848
01:12:37,178 --> 01:12:38,721
I know you're Neo.

849
01:12:39,347 --> 01:12:40,515
Be right with you.

850
01:12:41,557 --> 01:12:42,558
You're the Oracle?

851
01:12:42,934 --> 01:12:43,935
Bingo.

852
01:12:46,646 --> 01:12:49,524
Not quite what you
were expecting, right?

853
01:12:50,566 --> 01:12:52,735
Almost done.

854
01:12:55,238 --> 01:12:56,864
Smell good, don't they?

855
01:12:59,617 --> 01:13:01,452
I'd ask you to sit down...

856
01:13:01,703 --> 01:13:04,080
...but you're not going to anyway.

857
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:06,416
And don't worry about the vase.

858
01:13:06,624 --> 01:13:07,458
What vase?

859
01:13:10,586 --> 01:13:11,754
That vase.

860
01:13:12,714 --> 01:13:13,756
I'm sorry.

861
01:13:14,007 --> 01:13:15,883
I said, don't worry about it.

862
01:13:17,051 --> 01:13:19,012
I'll get one of my kids to fix it.

863
01:13:19,637 --> 01:13:20,847
How did you know?

864
01:13:20,870 --> 01:13:26,970
What's really going to bake
your noodle later on is...

865
01:13:27,020 --> 01:13:29,981
...would you still have broken it
if I hadn't said anything?

866
01:13:34,777 --> 01:13:36,696
You're cuter than I thought.

867
01:13:39,741 --> 01:13:41,993
I can see why she likes you.

868
01:13:42,869 --> 01:13:43,953
Who?

869
01:13:44,203 --> 01:13:46,039
Not too bright, though.

870
01:13:49,334 --> 01:13:52,420
You know why Morpheus
brought you to see me.

871
01:13:54,547 --> 01:13:55,715
So...

872
01:13:56,674 --> 01:13:58,051
...what do you think?

873
01:13:59,886 --> 01:14:01,638
Do you think you are the One?

874
01:14:03,598 --> 01:14:04,641
I don't know.

875
01:14:08,061 --> 01:14:09,479
You know what that means?

876
01:14:10,313 --> 01:14:11,481
It's Latin.

877
01:14:11,856 --> 01:14:14,067
Means, "Know thyself."

878
01:14:15,526 --> 01:14:17,487
I'll let you in on a little secret.

879
01:14:19,739 --> 01:14:23,576
Being the One is just
like being in love.

880
01:14:24,285 --> 01:14:27,163
No one can tell you you're in love.
You just know it...

881
01:14:27,413 --> 01:14:28,539
...through and through.

882
01:14:28,873 --> 01:14:30,917
Balls to bones.

883
01:14:33,461 --> 01:14:34,295
Well...

884
01:14:36,255 --> 01:14:38,341
...I'd better have a look at you.

885
01:14:39,676 --> 01:14:41,177
Open your mouth. Say, "Ah."

886
01:14:55,566 --> 01:14:57,235
Okay...

887
01:14:57,860 --> 01:15:03,124
Now I'm supposed to say,
"Hmm, that's interesting, but..."

888
01:15:03,324 --> 01:15:04,450
Then you say:

889
01:15:05,326 --> 01:15:06,327
But what?

890
01:15:06,577 --> 01:15:10,540
But you already know
what I'm going to tell you.

891
01:15:11,958 --> 01:15:12,959
I'm not the One.

892
01:15:13,209 --> 01:15:14,919
Sorry, kid.

893
01:15:16,546 --> 01:15:18,548
You got the gift...

894
01:15:19,549 --> 01:15:21,759
...but it looks like
you're waiting for something.

895
01:15:26,639 --> 01:15:27,473
What?

896
01:15:27,682 --> 01:15:30,601
Your next life, maybe. Who knows?

897
01:15:31,185 --> 01:15:33,438
That's the way these things go.

898
01:15:34,314 --> 01:15:35,189
What's funny?

899
01:15:35,565 --> 01:15:36,899
Morpheus.

900
01:15:37,570 --> 01:15:42,240
He almost had me convinced.

901
01:15:42,322 --> 01:15:43,448
I know.

902
01:15:44,991 --> 01:15:47,118
Poor Morpheus.

903
01:15:49,495 --> 01:15:52,624
Without him, we're lost.

904
01:15:54,167 --> 01:15:56,336
What do you mean, "without him"?

905
01:16:00,340 --> 01:16:02,258
Are you sure you want
to hear this?

906
01:16:04,469 --> 01:16:07,221
Morpheus believes in you, Neo.

907
01:16:08,931 --> 01:16:11,100
And no one, not you, not even me...

908
01:16:11,351 --> 01:16:13,603
...can convince him otherwise.

909
01:16:13,978 --> 01:16:16,356
He believes it so blindly...

910
01:16:16,648 --> 01:16:20,985
...that he's going to sacrifice
his life to save yours.

911
01:16:21,235 --> 01:16:22,070
What?

912
01:16:22,278 --> 01:16:25,198
You're going to
have to make a choice.

913
01:16:25,823 --> 01:16:29,410
In the one hand,
you'll have Morpheus' life.

914
01:16:29,911 --> 01:16:32,789
And in the other hand,
you'll have your own.

915
01:16:34,207 --> 01:16:36,501
One of you is going to die.

916
01:16:38,586 --> 01:16:43,060
Which one will be up to you.

917
01:16:43,257 --> 01:16:45,176
I'm sorry, kiddo. I really am.

918
01:16:45,426 --> 01:16:47,095
You have a good soul.

919
01:16:48,179 --> 01:16:50,890
And I hate giving
good people bad news.

920
01:16:52,310 --> 01:16:55,650
Don't worry about it.

921
01:16:55,728 --> 01:16:58,147
As soon as you
step outside that door...

922
01:16:58,398 --> 01:17:00,525
...you'll start feeling better.

923
01:17:01,234 --> 01:17:05,029
You'll remember you don't believe
in any of this fate crap.

924
01:17:05,863 --> 01:17:08,616
You're in control of your own life.

925
01:17:09,450 --> 01:17:10,743
Remember?

926
01:17:12,620 --> 01:17:13,621
Here...

927
01:17:15,498 --> 01:17:17,041
...take a cookie.

928
01:17:17,583 --> 01:17:20,920
I promise, by the time
you're done eating it...

929
01:17:21,879 --> 01:17:24,257
...you'll feel right as rain.

930
01:17:33,474 --> 01:17:34,809
What was said...

931
01:17:35,435 --> 01:17:36,894
...was for you...

932
01:17:37,437 --> 01:17:39,272
...and for you alone.

933
01:17:52,540 --> 01:17:54,270


934
01:18:02,211 --> 01:18:03,338
They're on the way.

935
01:18:33,326 --> 01:18:34,160
What is that?

936
01:18:48,925 --> 01:18:50,343


937
01:18:53,846 --> 01:18:54,931
What did you just say?

938
01:18:55,181 --> 01:18:56,683
Nothing.

939
01:18:56,933 --> 01:18:59,440
- What did you see?
- What happened?

940
01:18:59,978 --> 01:19:02,146
A black cat went past us...

941
01:19:02,397 --> 01:19:04,023
...then another just like it.

942
01:19:04,273 --> 01:19:05,817
Was it the same cat?

943
01:19:06,985 --> 01:19:07,986
I'm not sure.

944
01:19:08,778 --> 01:19:09,612
Switch, Apoc.

945
01:19:14,075 --> 01:19:14,909
What is it?

946
01:19:15,159 --> 01:19:19,580
Matrix when they change something.

947
01:19:22,959 --> 01:19:23,793
Oh, my God.

948
01:19:25,628 --> 01:19:26,587
Let's go.

949
01:19:31,843 --> 01:19:33,594
They cut the hard line.
It's a trap! Get out!

950
01:19:39,517 --> 01:19:40,351
Oh, no.

951
01:19:41,850 --> 01:19:42,940


952
01:20:20,642 --> 01:20:23,102
That's what they changed.
We're trapped.

953
01:20:23,353 --> 01:20:25,229
Be calm. Give me your phone.

954
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:27,023
They'll be able to track it.

955
01:20:27,273 --> 01:20:28,691
We have no choice.

956
01:20:30,109 --> 01:20:31,319
Operator.

957
01:20:31,653 --> 01:20:34,489
Find a structural drawing of
this building. Find it fast.

958
01:20:42,330 --> 01:20:45,080
- Got it!
- I need the main wet-wall.

959
01:20:48,169 --> 01:20:49,003
Eighth floor.

960
01:20:49,212 --> 01:20:50,797
They're on the eighth floor.

961
01:20:51,089 --> 01:20:52,548
Switch, straight ahead.

962
01:20:53,290 --> 01:20:54,950


963
01:21:00,598 --> 01:21:02,850
I hope the Oracle
gave you some good news.

964
01:21:11,025 --> 01:21:12,527
Now left. That's it.

965
01:21:12,819 --> 01:21:13,861
Good.

966
01:21:23,579 --> 01:21:24,872
Where are they?

967
01:22:25,308 --> 01:22:26,476
They're in the walls.

968
01:22:27,935 --> 01:22:29,103
In the walls!

969
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:51,334
It's an agent!

970
01:22:59,110 --> 01:23:00,910


971
01:23:01,135 --> 01:23:02,136
You must get Neo out!

972
01:23:02,470 --> 01:23:04,305
He's all that matters!

973
01:23:04,597 --> 01:23:05,807
No, Morpheus! Don't!

974
01:23:06,057 --> 01:23:06,891
Trinity, go!

975
01:23:07,767 --> 01:23:09,143
Go!

976
01:23:15,358 --> 01:23:17,276
- We can't leave him!
- We have to!

977
01:23:41,750 --> 01:23:43,980
Come on!

978
01:23:49,350 --> 01:23:50,518
The great Morpheus.
We meet at last.

979
01:23:52,687 --> 01:23:53,813
And you are?

980
01:23:54,063 --> 01:23:55,815
A Smith.

981
01:23:56,065 --> 01:23:57,358
Agent Smith.

982
01:23:57,942 --> 01:23:59,986
You all look the same to me.

983
01:24:55,625 --> 01:24:56,918
Take him.

984
01:25:03,540 --> 01:25:04,730


985
01:25:10,139 --> 01:25:12,270
- Operator.
- I need an exit, fast.

986
01:25:13,110 --> 01:25:17,210
There was an accident.
Goddamn car accident.

987
01:25:17,313 --> 01:25:19,107
All of a sudden, boom.

988
01:25:19,357 --> 01:25:20,733
Somebody up there still likes me.

989
01:25:20,984 --> 01:25:22,235
I got you.

990
01:25:22,735 --> 01:25:24,654
Just get me out of here fast.

991
01:25:24,904 --> 01:25:27,573
Nearest exit, Franklin and Erie.
An old TV repair shop.

992
01:25:27,824 --> 01:25:28,866
Right.

993
01:25:31,995 --> 01:25:33,790
- Operator.
- Tank, it's me.

994
01:25:33,830 --> 01:25:34,998
Is Morpheus alive?

995
01:25:35,373 --> 01:25:36,666
Is Morpheus alive, Tank?

996
01:25:37,083 --> 01:25:39,002
Yes. They're moving him.
I don 't know where.

997
01:25:39,210 --> 01:25:41,504
He's alive. We need an exit.

998
01:25:41,754 --> 01:25:42,672
You're not far from Cypher.

999
01:25:42,922 --> 01:25:44,257
- Cypher?
- I know.

1000
01:25:44,507 --> 01:25:46,870
- I sent him to Franklin and Erie.
- Got it.

1001
01:25:55,685 --> 01:25:56,894
Got him.

1002
01:26:07,822 --> 01:26:08,865
Where are they?

1003
01:26:09,115 --> 01:26:10,366
Making the call.

1004
01:26:11,034 --> 01:26:12,201
Good.

1005
01:26:25,757 --> 01:26:26,591
You first.

1006
01:26:29,761 --> 01:26:30,595
Shit!

1007
01:26:36,030 --> 01:26:37,550


1008
01:26:39,687 --> 01:26:41,856
I don't know. It just went dead.

1009
01:27:08,675 --> 01:27:09,884
Hello, Trinity.

1010
01:27:10,301 --> 01:27:11,636
Cypher? Where's Tank?

1011
01:27:17,225 --> 01:27:18,267
You know...

1012
01:27:19,978 --> 01:27:22,105
...for a long time...

1013
01:27:23,314 --> 01:27:26,234
...I thought I was in love with you.

1014
01:27:26,985 --> 01:27:29,028
I used to dream about you.

1015
01:27:30,113 --> 01:27:32,824
You're a beautiful woman, Trinity.

1016
01:27:33,074 --> 01:27:35,451
Too bad things had to
turn out this way.

1017
01:27:36,202 --> 01:27:37,036
You killed them.

1018
01:27:37,537 --> 01:27:39,090
- What?
- Oh, God.

1019
01:27:39,289 --> 01:27:40,707
I'm tired, Trinity.

1020
01:27:42,125 --> 01:27:44,002
I'm tired of this war...

1021
01:27:44,294 --> 01:27:47,130
...tired of fighting.
I'm tired of this ship...

1022
01:27:47,463 --> 01:27:52,093
...of being cold, of eating
the same goddamn goop every day.

1023
01:27:54,512 --> 01:27:55,430
But most of all...

1024
01:27:56,014 --> 01:27:59,392
...I'm tired of that jackoff
and all of his bullshit.

1025
01:28:00,518 --> 01:28:01,811
Surprise, asshole!

1026
01:28:02,353 --> 01:28:04,564
I bet you never saw this coming...

1027
01:28:04,814 --> 01:28:05,857
...did you?

1028
01:28:08,151 --> 01:28:10,528
God, I wish I could be there...

1029
01:28:11,112 --> 01:28:12,613
...when they break you.

1030
01:28:13,656 --> 01:28:16,826
I wish I could walk in
just when it happens...

1031
01:28:17,535 --> 01:28:19,245
...so right then...

1032
01:28:19,495 --> 01:28:20,830
...you'd know it was me.

1033
01:28:21,539 --> 01:28:22,498
You gave them Morpheus.

1034
01:28:22,749 --> 01:28:24,208
He lied to us, Trinity.

1035
01:28:24,792 --> 01:28:26,294
He tricked us!

1036
01:28:26,836 --> 01:28:28,838
If you had told us the truth...

1037
01:28:29,088 --> 01:28:31,966
...we would've told you to shove
that red pill up your ass!

1038
01:28:32,216 --> 01:28:34,344
That is not true, Cypher.
He set us free.

1039
01:28:34,594 --> 01:28:35,511
"Free."

1040
01:28:35,762 --> 01:28:37,472
You call this free?

1041
01:28:39,891 --> 01:28:42,393
All I do is what he tells me to do.

1042
01:28:43,978 --> 01:28:46,898
If I had to choose between
that and the Matrix...

1043
01:28:48,066 --> 01:28:49,275
...I choose the Matrix.

1044
01:28:49,525 --> 01:28:51,194
The Matrix isn't real.

1045
01:28:51,444 --> 01:28:52,862
I disagree, Trinity.

1046
01:28:53,112 --> 01:28:55,365
I think the Matrix...

1047
01:28:55,698 --> 01:28:58,284
...can be more real than this world.

1048
01:29:00,453 --> 01:29:02,956
All I do is pull the plug here.

1049
01:29:03,539 --> 01:29:04,540
But there...

1050
01:29:05,083 --> 01:29:07,377
...you have to watch Apoc die.

1051
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:12,780


1052
01:29:15,134 --> 01:29:16,844
Welcome to the real world.

1053
01:29:17,178 --> 01:29:18,096
But you're out.

1054
01:29:18,346 --> 01:29:20,765
- You can 't go back.
- That's what you think.

1055
01:29:21,015 --> 01:29:22,517
They'll reinsert my body.

1056
01:29:22,767 --> 01:29:26,396
I go back to sleep. When I wake up,
I won 't remember a thing.

1057
01:29:26,646 --> 01:29:27,647
By the way...

1058
01:29:27,897 --> 01:29:30,858
...if you have anything important
to say to Switch...

1059
01:29:31,359 --> 01:29:32,443
...say it now.

1060
01:29:32,694 --> 01:29:33,569
No, please don't.

1061
01:29:34,112 --> 01:29:35,738
Not like this.

1062
01:29:37,448 --> 01:29:39,075
Not like this.

1063
01:29:43,538 --> 01:29:44,580
Too late.

1064
01:29:44,956 --> 01:29:46,624
Goddamn you, Cypher!

1065
01:29:46,874 --> 01:29:48,751
Don't hate me, Trinity.

1066
01:29:49,127 --> 01:29:51,004
I'm just a messenger.

1067
01:29:51,421 --> 01:29:54,590
And right now,
I'm going to prove it to you.

1068
01:29:55,675 --> 01:29:57,343
If Morpheus was right...

1069
01:29:57,885 --> 01:29:59,762
...there's no way
I can pull this plug.

1070
01:30:00,346 --> 01:30:01,848
If Neo 's the One...

1071
01:30:02,348 --> 01:30:04,183
...then there'd have to be...

1072
01:30:04,434 --> 01:30:07,020
...some kind of a miracle to stop me.

1073
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:08,396
Right?

1074
01:30:09,022 --> 01:30:11,190
I mean, how can he be the One...

1075
01:30:11,482 --> 01:30:12,358
...if he's dead?

1076
01:30:13,735 --> 01:30:15,987
You never did answer me before...

1077
01:30:16,279 --> 01:30:18,614
...if you bought into
Morpheus ' bullshit.

1078
01:30:18,990 --> 01:30:22,201
Come on. All I want
is a little yes or no.

1079
01:30:23,578 --> 01:30:25,913
Look into his eyes...

1080
01:30:26,664 --> 01:30:28,166
...those big, pretty eyes...

1081
01:30:30,918 --> 01:30:32,253
...and tell me...

1082
01:30:32,962 --> 01:30:34,255
...yes...

1083
01:30:34,547 --> 01:30:35,923
...or no.

1084
01:30:37,216 --> 01:30:38,070
Yes.

1085
01:30:38,270 --> 01:30:40,640
I don't believe it.

1086
01:30:41,512 --> 01:30:46,267
Believe it or not, you piece of shit,
you're still going to burn!

1087
01:31:04,953 --> 01:31:05,912
You first.

1088
01:31:14,128 --> 01:31:15,004
You're hurt.

1089
01:31:15,338 --> 01:31:16,422
I'll be all right.

1090
01:31:19,217 --> 01:31:20,385
Dozer?

1091
01:31:38,653 --> 01:31:41,030
Have you ever stood and stared at it?

1092
01:31:41,906 --> 01:31:45,034
Marveled at its beauty...

1093
01:31:45,410 --> 01:31:47,662
...its genius?

1094
01:31:48,830 --> 01:31:50,707
Billions of people...

1095
01:31:50,957 --> 01:31:53,710
...just living out their lives.

1096
01:31:54,752 --> 01:31:56,421
Oblivious.

1097
01:32:01,009 --> 01:32:03,886
Did you know that the first Matrix...

1098
01:32:04,137 --> 01:32:08,850
...was designed to be a perfect
human world where none suffered...

1099
01:32:09,309 --> 01:32:12,228
...where everyone would be happy.

1100
01:32:12,770 --> 01:32:14,272
It was a disaster.

1101
01:32:14,522 --> 01:32:18,970
No one would accept the program.
Entire crops were lost.

1102
01:32:19,736 --> 01:32:21,487
Some believe that...

1103
01:32:21,738 --> 01:32:26,200
...we lacked the programming language
to describe your perfect world.

1104
01:32:26,367 --> 01:32:27,910
But I believe that...

1105
01:32:28,328 --> 01:32:29,245
...as a species...

1106
01:32:29,495 --> 01:32:33,333
...human beings define
their reality through misery...

1107
01:32:33,583 --> 01:32:34,959
...and suffering.

1108
01:32:35,209 --> 01:32:37,920
So the perfect world was a dream...

1109
01:32:38,171 --> 01:32:43,009
...that your primitive cerebrum
kept trying to wake up from.

1110
01:32:44,344 --> 01:32:48,014
Which is why the Matrix was
redesigned to this.

1111
01:32:48,473 --> 01:32:49,974
The peak...

1112
01:32:50,224 --> 01:32:51,643
...of your civilization.

1113
01:32:51,893 --> 01:32:54,145
I say, "your civilization"...

1114
01:32:54,395 --> 01:32:58,524
...because when we started thinking
for you, it became our civilization...

1115
01:32:58,775 --> 01:33:01,210
...which is, of course,
what this is all about.

1116
01:33:01,410 --> 01:33:05,980
Evolution, Morpheus.

1117
01:33:06,074 --> 01:33:07,408
Evolution.

1118
01:33:09,702 --> 01:33:11,579
Like the dinosaur.

1119
01:33:13,748 --> 01:33:15,375
Look out that window.

1120
01:33:16,084 --> 01:33:18,211
You had your time.

1121
01:33:18,920 --> 01:33:22,840
The future is our world, Morpheus.

1122
01:33:23,174 --> 01:33:25,551
The future is our time.

1123
01:33:29,806 --> 01:33:30,932
There could be a problem.

1124
01:33:31,891 --> 01:33:35,410
- What are they doing to him?
- They're breaking into his mind.

1125
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:37,689
It's like hacking a computer.
All it takes is time.

1126
01:33:37,939 --> 01:33:39,148
How much time?

1127
01:33:39,399 --> 01:33:42,577
Depends on the mind.
But eventually, it'll crack...

1128
01:33:42,777 --> 01:33:47,198
...and his alpha patterns
will change from this to this.

1129
01:33:47,448 --> 01:33:50,410
When it does, he'll tell them
anything they want to know.

1130
01:33:50,660 --> 01:33:51,703
What do they want?

1131
01:33:51,953 --> 01:33:55,999
The leader of every ship is given codes
to Zion's mainframe computer.

1132
01:33:56,249 --> 01:33:59,168
If an agent got the codes
and got into Zion's mainframe...

1133
01:33:59,419 --> 01:34:02,270
...they could destroy us.
We can't let that happen.

1134
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:04,974
Zion's more important than me...

1135
01:34:05,174 --> 01:34:06,092
...or you...

1136
01:34:06,426 --> 01:34:07,719
...or even Morpheus.

1137
01:34:11,514 --> 01:34:13,182
There has to be
something we can do.

1138
01:34:13,599 --> 01:34:15,601
There is. We pull the plug.

1139
01:34:18,688 --> 01:34:20,440
You're going to kill him?

1140
01:34:20,690 --> 01:34:21,858
Kill Morpheus?

1141
01:34:22,483 --> 01:34:24,110
We don't have a choice.

1142
01:34:30,908 --> 01:34:33,828
Never send a human
to do a machine's job.

1143
01:34:34,078 --> 01:34:35,830
If the insider has failed...

1144
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:39,440
...they'll sever the connection
as soon as possible, unless...

1145
01:34:39,542 --> 01:34:41,252
They're dead. In either case...

1146
01:34:41,502 --> 01:34:43,620
We have no choice. Continue as planned.
Deploy the sentinels.

1147
01:34:43,820 --> 01:34:46,382
Immediately.

1148
01:34:51,638 --> 01:34:54,307
Morpheus, you were more
than a leader to us.

1149
01:34:55,266 --> 01:34:57,477
You were a father.

1150
01:34:59,020 --> 01:35:00,980
We'll miss you always.

1151
01:35:08,071 --> 01:35:09,072
Stop!

1152
01:35:10,281 --> 01:35:11,491
I don't believe this is happening.

1153
01:35:11,741 --> 01:35:14,380
- Neo, this has to be done.
- Does it?

1154
01:35:14,577 --> 01:35:15,954
I don't know.

1155
01:35:16,287 --> 01:35:17,830
This can't be just coincidence.

1156
01:35:18,039 --> 01:35:18,873
What?

1157
01:35:19,374 --> 01:35:20,208
The Oracle.

1158
01:35:20,458 --> 01:35:22,251
She told me this would happen.

1159
01:35:22,669 --> 01:35:26,960
She told me that I would
have to make a choice.

1160
01:35:27,298 --> 01:35:28,549
What choice?

1161
01:35:31,511 --> 01:35:32,387
What are you doing?

1162
01:35:32,804 --> 01:35:34,013
I'm going in.

1163
01:35:34,347 --> 01:35:35,598
No, you're not.

1164
01:35:35,848 --> 01:35:36,683
I have to.

1165
01:35:36,891 --> 01:35:40,520
Neo, Morpheus sacrificed himself
so that we could get you out.

1166
01:35:40,770 --> 01:35:42,689
There is no way
that you're going back in.

1167
01:35:43,272 --> 01:35:46,526
Morpheus did what he did because
he believed I'm something I'm not.

1168
01:35:48,310 --> 01:35:49,610


1169
01:35:49,779 --> 01:35:51,406
I'm not the One, Trinity.

1170
01:35:51,781 --> 01:35:54,950
- The Oracle hit me with that too.
- No, you have to be.

1171
01:35:54,993 --> 01:35:57,662
I'm sorry, I'm not.
I'm just another guy.

1172
01:35:58,329 --> 01:35:59,580
No, Neo, that's not true.

1173
01:36:00,164 --> 01:36:01,499
It can't be true.

1174
01:36:01,833 --> 01:36:02,792
Why?

1175
01:36:07,213 --> 01:36:10,550
This is loco. They've got Morpheus
in a military-controlled building.

1176
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:16,100
Even if you somehow got inside, those
are agents holding him. Three of them.

1177
01:36:16,472 --> 01:36:20,393
I want Morpheus back too, but
what you're talking about is suicide.

1178
01:36:20,643 --> 01:36:22,270
That's what it looks like...

1179
01:36:22,520 --> 01:36:23,438
...but it's not.

1180
01:36:23,688 --> 01:36:26,065
I can't explain to you why it's not.

1181
01:36:27,150 --> 01:36:30,912
Morpheus believed something, and
he was ready to give his life for it.

1182
01:36:31,112 --> 01:36:34,115
I understand that now.
That's why I have to go.

1183
01:36:34,365 --> 01:36:35,199
Why?

1184
01:36:35,450 --> 01:36:36,909
Because I believe in something.

1185
01:36:37,118 --> 01:36:37,952
What?

1186
01:36:39,412 --> 01:36:41,122
I believe I can bring him back.

1187
01:36:58,097 --> 01:37:00,108
- What are you doing?
- Going with you.

1188
01:37:00,308 --> 01:37:01,184
No, you're not.

1189
01:37:01,434 --> 01:37:02,310
"No"?

1190
01:37:03,478 --> 01:37:05,605
Let me tell you what I believe.

1191
01:37:06,105 --> 01:37:08,483
Morpheus means more to me
than he does to you.

1192
01:37:08,816 --> 01:37:13,112
I believe if you are serious about
saving him, you will need my help.

1193
01:37:13,363 --> 01:37:15,406
And since I am the ranking officer...

1194
01:37:15,657 --> 01:37:18,534
...if you don't like it,
I believe you can go to hell.

1195
01:37:19,285 --> 01:37:21,704
Because you aren't going anywhere else.

1196
01:37:22,121 --> 01:37:22,956
Tank...

1197
01:37:23,831 --> 01:37:24,999
...Ioad us up.

1198
01:37:34,592 --> 01:37:37,887
I'd like to share
a revelation that I've had...

1199
01:37:38,304 --> 01:37:39,847
...during my time here.

1200
01:37:40,098 --> 01:37:44,152
It came to me when I tried
to classify your species...

1201
01:37:44,352 --> 01:37:46,604
...and I realized...

1202
01:37:46,854 --> 01:37:49,148
...that you're not actually mammals.

1203
01:37:51,359 --> 01:37:53,820
Every mammal on this planet...

1204
01:37:54,153 --> 01:37:59,075
...instinctively develops an equilibrium
with the surrounding environment.

1205
01:37:59,325 --> 01:38:01,160
But you humans do not.

1206
01:38:01,703 --> 01:38:05,248
You move to an area
and you multiply...

1207
01:38:05,498 --> 01:38:10,003
...and multiply until every
natural resource is consumed.

1208
01:38:10,336 --> 01:38:12,422
The only way you can survive...

1209
01:38:12,714 --> 01:38:15,675
...is to spread to another area.

1210
01:38:21,097 --> 01:38:23,975
There is another organism
on this planet...

1211
01:38:24,225 --> 01:38:26,185
...that follows the same pattern.

1212
01:38:26,811 --> 01:38:28,479
Do you know what it is?

1213
01:38:28,855 --> 01:38:30,690
A virus.

1214
01:38:32,025 --> 01:38:35,310
Human beings are a disease.

1215
01:38:35,445 --> 01:38:36,988
A cancer of this planet.

1216
01:38:37,238 --> 01:38:39,365
You are a plague.

1217
01:38:39,907 --> 01:38:40,908
And we...

1218
01:38:41,492 --> 01:38:42,869
...are the cure.

1219
01:38:43,870 --> 01:38:45,288
Okay, so what do you need?

1220
01:38:45,913 --> 01:38:47,040
Besides a miracle.

1221
01:38:47,624 --> 01:38:48,833
Guns.

1222
01:38:49,876 --> 01:38:50,877
Lots of guns.

1223
01:39:00,840 --> 01:39:02,140


1224
01:39:03,723 --> 01:39:06,267
No one has ever done
anything like this.

1225
01:39:07,477 --> 01:39:09,395
That's why it's going to work.

1226
01:39:13,483 --> 01:39:15,443
Why isn't the serum working?

1227
01:39:16,027 --> 01:39:18,321
Perhaps we're asking
the wrong questions.

1228
01:39:20,406 --> 01:39:21,658
Leave me with him.

1229
01:39:24,243 --> 01:39:25,370
Now.

1230
01:39:36,589 --> 01:39:38,174
Hold on, Morpheus.

1231
01:39:38,424 --> 01:39:41,440
They're coming for you.
They're coming.

1232
01:39:43,513 --> 01:39:45,640
Can you hear me, Morpheus?

1233
01:39:45,890 --> 01:39:48,559
I'm going to be honest...

1234
01:39:48,935 --> 01:39:50,144
...with you.

1235
01:39:54,524 --> 01:39:55,942
I...

1236
01:39:57,026 --> 01:39:57,944
...hate...

1237
01:39:58,194 --> 01:40:00,154
...this place...

1238
01:40:00,488 --> 01:40:02,782
...this zoo...

1239
01:40:03,032 --> 01:40:04,158
...this prison...

1240
01:40:04,409 --> 01:40:07,578
...this reality,
whatever you want to call it.

1241
01:40:07,829 --> 01:40:10,123
I can't stand it any longer.

1242
01:40:10,873 --> 01:40:12,750
It's the smell.

1243
01:40:14,127 --> 01:40:16,004
If there is such a thing.

1244
01:40:16,337 --> 01:40:19,632
I feel saturated by it.

1245
01:40:21,134 --> 01:40:22,427
I can...

1246
01:40:22,677 --> 01:40:23,553
...taste...

1247
01:40:24,387 --> 01:40:26,431
...your stink.

1248
01:40:26,681 --> 01:40:29,590
And every time I do, I fear that
I have somehow been infected by it.

1249
01:40:29,790 --> 01:40:31,760
It's repulsive.

1250
01:40:32,478 --> 01:40:33,855
Isn't it?

1251
01:40:36,024 --> 01:40:38,318
I must get out of here.

1252
01:40:38,735 --> 01:40:40,945
I must get free.

1253
01:40:41,195 --> 01:40:44,073
And in this mind is the key.

1254
01:40:44,324 --> 01:40:45,992
My key.

1255
01:40:46,242 --> 01:40:49,120
Once Zion is destroyed,
there is no need for me to be here.

1256
01:40:49,370 --> 01:40:50,997
Do you understand?

1257
01:40:51,289 --> 01:40:52,665
I need the codes.

1258
01:40:52,915 --> 01:40:55,251
I have to get inside Zion...

1259
01:40:55,585 --> 01:40:58,087
...and you have to tell me how.

1260
01:40:58,504 --> 01:41:00,381
You're going to tell me...

1261
01:41:00,632 --> 01:41:02,800
...or you're going to die.

1262
01:41:21,945 --> 01:41:24,030
Please remove any metallic items
you're carrying. Keys, loose change.

1263
01:41:30,036 --> 01:41:31,079
Holy shit!

1264
01:41:43,174 --> 01:41:44,050
Backup.

1265
01:41:44,300 --> 01:41:45,885
Send backup.

1266
01:42:09,909 --> 01:42:10,827
Freeze!

1267
01:44:25,878 --> 01:44:26,879
What were you doing?

1268
01:44:28,715 --> 01:44:30,008
He doesn't know.

1269
01:44:30,258 --> 01:44:31,759
Know what?

1270
01:44:59,829 --> 01:45:02,332
I think they're trying to save him.

1271
01:45:17,180 --> 01:45:18,931
There is no spoon.

1272
01:45:47,740 --> 01:45:50,080
Find them and destroy them!

1273
01:45:50,280 --> 01:45:53,299
We're under attack!

1274
01:46:26,180 --> 01:46:27,270


1275
01:46:28,209 --> 01:46:29,043
Help!

1276
01:46:51,065 --> 01:46:52,275
Only human.

1277
01:46:53,359 --> 01:46:54,319
Dodge this.

1278
01:47:07,540 --> 01:47:09,380
- How did you do that?
- Do what?

1279
01:47:09,459 --> 01:47:13,720
You moved like they do.
I've never seen anyone move that fast.

1280
01:47:14,505 --> 01:47:15,882
It wasn't fast enough.

1281
01:47:18,635 --> 01:47:19,927
Can you fly that thing?

1282
01:47:21,262 --> 01:47:22,096
Not yet.

1283
01:47:25,558 --> 01:47:26,392
Operator.

1284
01:47:26,601 --> 01:47:29,771
I need a pilot program
for a B-212 helicopter.

1285
01:47:30,229 --> 01:47:31,522
Hurry.

1286
01:47:39,447 --> 01:47:41,074
Let's go.

1287
01:47:56,172 --> 01:47:57,256
No.

1288
01:48:48,850 --> 01:48:50,393
Morpheus, get up.

1289
01:48:50,643 --> 01:48:51,477
Get up, get up.

1290
01:49:29,515 --> 01:49:30,558
He's not going to make it.

1291
01:49:40,360 --> 01:49:41,402
Got you.

1292
01:51:30,303 --> 01:51:31,721
I knew it.

1293
01:51:32,555 --> 01:51:33,556
He's the One.

1294
01:51:49,530 --> 01:51:51,741
Do you believe it now, Trinity?

1295
01:51:54,540 --> 01:51:55,770


1296
01:51:57,664 --> 01:51:58,539
The Oracle.

1297
01:51:59,791 --> 01:52:02,440
- She told me...
- She told you...

1298
01:52:02,543 --> 01:52:04,128
...what you needed to hear.

1299
01:52:04,420 --> 01:52:05,755
That's all.

1300
01:52:06,798 --> 01:52:09,759
Sooner or later you'll realize,
just as I did...

1301
01:52:10,093 --> 01:52:12,387
...there's a difference
between knowing the path...

1302
01:52:13,137 --> 01:52:14,430
...and walking the path.

1303
01:52:17,475 --> 01:52:18,000
Operator.

1304
01:52:18,200 --> 01:52:19,320


1305
01:52:19,602 --> 01:52:22,146
- It's good to hear your voice.
- We need an exit.

1306
01:52:22,397 --> 01:52:25,400
Got one ready. Subway station,
State and Balboa.

1307
01:52:38,246 --> 01:52:39,205
Damn it!

1308
01:52:39,455 --> 01:52:40,665
The trace was completed.

1309
01:52:40,915 --> 01:52:41,833
We have their position.

1310
01:52:42,250 --> 01:52:44,502
Sentinels are standing by.

1311
01:52:46,212 --> 01:52:47,714
Order the strike.

1312
01:52:54,262 --> 01:52:55,388
They're not out yet.

1313
01:53:07,442 --> 01:53:08,776
You first, Morpheus.

1314
01:53:29,464 --> 01:53:31,758
Neo, I want to tell you something...

1315
01:53:35,011 --> 01:53:39,930
...but I'm afraid of
what it could mean if I do.

1316
01:53:42,560 --> 01:53:45,855
Everything the Oracle
told me has come true.

1317
01:53:48,608 --> 01:53:50,151
Everything but this.

1318
01:53:51,861 --> 01:53:52,695
But what?

1319
01:54:17,820 --> 01:54:18,710


1320
01:54:19,013 --> 01:54:19,720
- What happened?
- An agent.

1321
01:54:19,920 --> 01:54:21,910
Send me back.

1322
01:54:21,975 --> 01:54:22,850
I can't.

1323
01:54:24,852 --> 01:54:26,854
Mr. Anderson.

1324
01:54:29,023 --> 01:54:30,400
Run, Neo. Run.

1325
01:54:35,697 --> 01:54:37,323
What is he doing?

1326
01:54:37,573 --> 01:54:38,825
He's beginning to believe.

1327
01:55:04,684 --> 01:55:07,560
You're empty.

1328
01:55:07,770 --> 01:55:09,063
So are you.

1329
01:55:42,221 --> 01:55:45,224
I'm going to enjoy watching you die...

1330
01:55:46,351 --> 01:55:47,393
...Mr. Anderson.

1331
01:56:28,351 --> 01:56:30,436
Jesus, he's killing him.

1332
01:57:56,606 --> 01:57:58,733
You hear that, Mr. Anderson?

1333
01:57:59,484 --> 01:58:02,487
That is the sound of inevitability.

1334
01:58:05,073 --> 01:58:08,409
It is the sound of your death.

1335
01:58:09,327 --> 01:58:11,663
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.

1336
01:58:11,913 --> 01:58:13,539
My name...

1337
01:58:16,542 --> 01:58:18,586
...is Neo.

1338
01:58:50,827 --> 01:58:53,050
- What happened?
- I don't know. I lost him.

1339
01:58:53,420 --> 01:58:54,820


1340
01:58:55,540 --> 01:58:56,582
Oh, shit.

1341
01:59:08,970 --> 01:59:10,430
Sentinels.

1342
01:59:11,180 --> 01:59:13,640
- How long?
- Five, maybe six minutes.

1343
01:59:15,476 --> 01:59:17,645
Tank, charge the EMP.

1344
01:59:17,895 --> 01:59:21,280
- We can't use that until he's out.
- I know. Don't worry.

1345
01:59:22,317 --> 01:59:23,192
He's gonna make it.

1346
01:59:23,443 --> 01:59:25,320
Flat or pumps? No, just...

1347
01:59:25,570 --> 01:59:28,448
What the shit? That's my phone!

1348
01:59:28,865 --> 01:59:30,450
That guy took my phone!

1349
01:59:32,827 --> 01:59:33,661
Got him!

1350
01:59:33,911 --> 01:59:35,121
He's on the run.

1351
01:59:35,371 --> 01:59:36,205
Mr. Wizard...

1352
01:59:36,664 --> 01:59:38,041
...get me out of here!

1353
01:59:38,291 --> 01:59:40,168
I got an old exit.
Wabash and Lake.

1354
01:59:44,213 --> 01:59:45,048
Oh, shit!

1355
02:00:06,694 --> 02:00:08,696
Help! Need a little help!

1356
02:00:10,323 --> 02:00:11,532
The door.

1357
02:00:27,507 --> 02:00:29,008
The door on your left.

1358
02:00:29,926 --> 02:00:31,177
Your other left!

1359
02:00:37,892 --> 02:00:39,143
The back door.

1360
02:00:58,350 --> 02:00:59,610


1361
02:00:59,914 --> 02:01:01,040
Oh, no.

1362
02:01:02,709 --> 02:01:04,210
Here they come.

1363
02:01:32,989 --> 02:01:34,240
He's going to make it.

1364
02:01:44,459 --> 02:01:47,587
The fire escape at the end
of the alley, room 303.

1365
02:02:20,100 --> 02:02:21,290


1366
02:02:22,914 --> 02:02:23,790
They're inside.

1367
02:02:26,334 --> 02:02:27,168
Hurry, Neo.

1368
02:03:23,516 --> 02:03:24,517
It can't be.

1369
02:03:32,317 --> 02:03:33,693
Check him.

1370
02:03:37,697 --> 02:03:39,240
He's gone.

1371
02:03:45,955 --> 02:03:48,374
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.

1372
02:03:56,190 --> 02:04:00,690
I'm not afraid anymore.

1373
02:04:02,055 --> 02:04:03,306
The Oracle told me...

1374
02:04:05,475 --> 02:04:09,900
...I'd fall in love, and that
the man I loved would be the One.

1375
02:04:12,106 --> 02:04:14,067
So you see...

1376
02:04:14,776 --> 02:04:16,778
...you can't be dead.

1377
02:04:18,363 --> 02:04:20,198
You can't be...

1378
02:04:21,741 --> 02:04:23,910
...because I love you.

1379
02:04:25,745 --> 02:04:27,455
You hear me?

1380
02:04:28,581 --> 02:04:30,249
I love you.

1381
02:04:54,190 --> 02:04:55,275
Now, get up.

1382
02:05:04,284 --> 02:05:05,118
No.

1383
02:05:32,061 --> 02:05:32,895
How?

1384
02:05:33,771 --> 02:05:34,814
He is the One.

1385
02:07:01,680 --> 02:07:02,440


1386
02:07:14,830 --> 02:07:15,620


1387
02:07:59,292 --> 02:08:01,002
I know you're out there.

1388
02:08:01,252 --> 02:08:03,087
I can feel you now.

1389
02:08:03,504 --> 02:08:05,298
I know that you're afraid.

1390
02:08:05,548 --> 02:08:07,133
You're afraid of us.

1391
02:08:07,467 --> 02:08:09,302
You're afraid of change.

1392
02:08:09,552 --> 02:08:12,013
I don 't know the future.

1393
02:08:12,263 --> 02:08:14,899
I didn 't come here to tell you
how this is going to end.

1394
02:08:15,099 --> 02:08:18,061
I came here to tell you
how it's going to begin.

1395
02:08:19,020 --> 02:08:20,605
I'll hang up this phone.

1396
02:08:20,855 --> 02:08:23,942
And then I'll show these people
what you don 't want them to see.

1397
02:08:24,192 --> 02:08:26,069
I'm going to show them a world...

1398
02:08:26,319 --> 02:08:28,071
...without you.

1399
02:08:28,363 --> 02:08:31,991
A world without rules and controls,
without borders or boundaries.

1400
02:08:32,241 --> 02:08:35,954
A world where anything is possible.

1401
02:08:38,581 --> 02:08:39,916
Where we go from there...

1402
02:08:40,166 --> 02:08:42,126
...is a choice I leave to you.

1403
02:09:25,720 --> 02:09:28,590


1404
02:09:29,620 --> 02:09:32,420


1405
02:10:03,990 --> 02:10:06,620


1406
02:10:07,690 --> 02:10:10,750


1407
02:10:12,200 --> 02:10:15,290


1408
02:10:41,560 --> 02:10:46,230
