他們掌握了充分的證據
They have a solid case.

每一個他們指控你的罪名
For every charge they're gonna lay on you,

68
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,830
都有這么一個文件夾  你的推特和圖片分享

You said they wouldn't figure this shit out.

They can't, brah.

I'm telling you, it was airtight, V.

Besides, who told you to put your business

00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,250
弄到社交網絡上去的
anywhere near social media?

當然是我那靈光的老弟了

Made our whole operation way more efficient.

79

我們很小心
We were careful.

80
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,100
你們把每一筆交易都發到推特上了
You tweeted about every transaction your business was involved in.

81
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,040
簡直就是小心的反義詞
That is the opposite of careful.

82
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:30,300
難怪會有匿名線報把你舉報了
It's no wonder an anonymous tip turned you in.

83
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,030
誰舉報的
Who called in the tip?

84
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,090
不知道  所以才叫"匿名線報"
This is what is meant by anonymous.

85
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,920
現在是覆水難收了
It is now spilled milk.

86

The information got out,

87
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,440
現在后果很嚴重
and now they're coming down hard.

88
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,650
對方無意提供檢控協議
There's no plea on the table.

89
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,380
他們會指控你一級謀殺
They're gonna lay murder one on you.

90
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,760
反正我也沒打算認罪
I ain't pleading anyway.

91
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,140
凡人不能給我判刑
Men can't sentence me.

92
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,440
只有宇宙能審判我
That is a cosmic responsibility.

93
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,770
會有人為此付出代價的
Someone's gonna get hurt for this.

94
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,000
這樣我們才能跟宇宙扯平
That's how we get square with the universe.

If they lock me up,

99
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:08,380

the kind of door they close don't matter.

00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:36,120
但是想上二樓就不能靠比爾了
but Bill is not gonna be able to get us to Level 2.

138
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,060
而我們得上到二樓
And we need to get to Level 2.

139
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,780
你得要求和他的主管溫蒂談
You're gonna ask to speak to his supervisor, Wendy.

她會帶我們去我們想去的地方
She'll get us to exactly where we need to be.

142
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,130

Then we'll be able to get rid of her from the van.

He would, without hesitation,

就為了證明自己
just to prove something.

他進去的話  可能會把整個建筑炸毀
He goes in there, he's liable to blow the whole place up,

你什么也不是
You're nothing.

你真沒用
You're worthless.

Think about what?

279
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:56,700
如果你死了
If you died,

280
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,430
會有人在乎嗎
would anyone care?

281
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,110
他們真的會在乎嗎
Would they really care?

282
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,460
沒錯  或許他們會哭上一天
Yeah, maybe they'd cry for a day,

283
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,440
但面對現實吧
but let's be honest.

284
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,940
根本沒人會在乎
No one would give a shit.

285

他們不會在乎
They wouldn't.

The few people that would feel obligated to go to your funeral

00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,370
很可能心里也會不痛快
would probably be annoyed,

00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:23,180
而且很早就離場

289
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,720
那就是你
That's who you are.

290
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,370
你的本質
That's what you are.

291
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:40,830
沒人在乎你
You're nothing to anyone,

一個都沒有

293

想想吧  比爾
Think about it, Bill.

294
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,830
因為如果你真去想
'cause if you do,

295
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,210
如果你肯去想
if you let yourself...

296
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,830
你就會知道我說的是實話
You'll know I'm telling you the truth.

297
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,450
所以別再浪費我的時間了
So instead of wasting any more of my time,

298
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:05,960
去給我叫個管事的人來
I need you to go call someone that matters,

299
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,470
因為  比爾...
because, Bill...

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,480
你是無名小輩
You don't.

00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:45,790
艾略特
Elliot.

410
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:48,090
-見到你很高興  -我也是
- Nice meeting you. - You too.

411
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:50,580
-代我向尊夫人問好  -好的
- Tell your wife I said hi. - I will.

412
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:53,940
我剛握手的那幾位
Those men I just shook hands with,

413
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:56,640
是真主黨和伊斯蘭國的投資人
financiers of Hezbollah and ISIS.

414
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,380
別盯著他們看
I wouldn't stare.

415
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,240
他知道我會來這兒嗎
Did he know I was gonna be here?

416
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:02,970
他知道我來這兒干什么嗎
Does he know why I'm here?

417
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,080
媽的  他會殺了我的
Shit, he's gonna kill me.

418
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:06,700
你剛剛說什么
As you were saying?

419
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:10,460
只是例行數據處理檢測
Uh, just a routine data process check.

420
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:12,620
眾安經常這么干
Allsafe does them all the time.

421
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:15,920
可他們為什么派你來
But why would they send you?

422
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:17,940
這種事通常都由
That type of thing isn't usually handled

423
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,560
工程師來處理  不是嗎
by the engineers, is it?

424
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,140
我們的工作經常重疊
We've been overlapping a lot in our duties.

425
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,160
出于預算考慮
Budget reasons.

426
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:29,820
看來我們今天都決定在公司外工作
It seems we both had the idea to work off-site today.

427
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,460
稱其為巧合好了
Let's call this fortuitous.

428
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,180
跟我一起吃午飯嗎
Join me for lunch?

429
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,260
好啊
S-sure.

430
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,290
反正我也得吃午飯
I eat lunch.

431
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,080
看來你和我們是一樣的啊
So you are like the rest of us.

432
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,580
來吧
Come.

433
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,050
他被困住了
He got owned, man.

434
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:53,220
我們得走了
We got to go.

435
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,110
我們哪也不去
We're not going anywhere.

436
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,620
這不影響什么
This changes nothing.

437
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,170
你想吃什么  艾略特
What can I get you, Elliot?

438
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:00,950
這里東西很多
Have a lot of things here.

439
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,230
他有一個弱點
He has a vulnerability.

440
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:04,760
他是個自大的蠢貨  還引以為傲
He's an arrogant prick, and he's proud of it.

441
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,810
他在乎你對他的看法
He cares what you think about him,

442
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,560
雖然他可能也討厭自己這樣
even though he probably hates that he does.

443
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,410
提利爾·威利克最大的優勢就是他的狂妄自大
Tyrell Wellick's greatest asset is his hubris,

444
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,950
但這也是他的破綻  你的突破口
but it's also his flaw, and that's your exploit.

445
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,200
...不錯哦
Would be nice.

446
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,210
你就在這兒吃
You eat here?

447
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,180
這地方
This place?

448
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,060
你就打這個算盤  激怒他
Is that your plan, to piss him off?

449
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,520
等下  等等
No, wait, man. Wait.

Now remember, Elliot,

452
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,190
到了二樓你會失去我們的信號
you'll lose our signal on level 2.

453

艾略特
Elliot.

00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:41,410
艾略特  聽到就說句話
Elliot, say something if you can hear us.

455
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:49,650
你會大老遠跑來真下功夫
I'm impressed you came all the way out here.

456
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:53,240
眾安完了  但你不肯讓它倒閉
Allsafe is finished, but you won't let it die.

457
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,280
我們一樣
We're the same.

458
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:57,370
我們是完美主義者
We're perfectionists.

459
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:10,430
那位服務員  我看他在這里干了...7年了
I've seen our waiter here for the last... seven years.

460
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,730

Must be in his 50s, maybe has kids,

461
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,360
離異  再婚  又生了孩子
divorced, second wife, more kids.

462
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,670
我不禁好奇
And I wonder,

463
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,140
他是怎么想自己的
what must he think of himself?

464
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:26,050
他的人生就是如此  年薪三萬元
His life's potential reached at a 30-grand-a-year salary,

465
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:28,580

468
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,690
我忍受不了
I couldn't bear it,

469
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,120
這種生活
a life like that.

470
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:41,320
這種平凡小人物的生活
The life of an ordinary cockroach

471
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,440
其最大的價值就是為我端沙拉

戒斷反應又開始了
Goddamn withdrawals again.

474
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:57,100
還是因為提利爾·威利克
Or is it Tyrell Wellick?

475
00:22:57,530 --> 00:22:58,720
他在玩兒我嗎
Is he toying with me?

我們這演的哪一出

I'm not turning you in, if that's what you're thinking.

I don't even have proof,

而且就算我有  我也不在乎

我只想掌握你的軟肋

I'll float you some money for professional development.

550
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,470
爸爸
Dad--

551
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:53,730
就當是貸款
Call it a loan,

552
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,370
但別還我
but do not pay me back.

553
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:59,060
而且你還得住下  通勤上班
And you'll stay here and commute

554
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,690
直到攢夠錢再找一間公寓
until you can save for an apartment.

555
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,620
我不能逼你那么做
I can't make you do any of that.

556
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:03,620
你沒逼我
And you didn't.

557
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,500
我想這么做
It's what I want.

558
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,860
你餓嗎
Are you hungry?

559
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,480
-嗯  -別  坐著
- Yeah. - No, no. Sit, sit, sit, sit.

560
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,570
坐好
Relax.

561
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:14,120
想吃什么
What would you like?

562
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,530
你不用給我做飯啦  爸爸
You don't need to cook for me, dad.

563
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:19,540
法式吐司  這就來
French toast coming up!

564
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:26,100
{\an8}{\pos(192.9,218)}這白癡要害我們遲到了

565
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:28,890
{\an8}{\pos(192.9,218)}那我們就遲到唄  讓他們等

566
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:33,790
{\an8}{\pos(192.9,218)}我見過他嗎

567
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:38,230
{\an8}{\pos(192.9,218)}肯定是沒留下什么印象

568
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,530
{\an8}{\pos(192.9,218)}是喜歡談酒的那個嗎

569
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:46,950
{\an8}{\pos(192.9,218)}她呢

570
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:49,290
{\an8}{\pos(192.9,218)}你老問她做什么

571
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:54,080
{\an8}{\pos(192.9,200)}因為我還不知道她想要什么  這讓我緊張

572
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:56,630
{\an8}{\pos(192.9,218)}別慌

573
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,050
{\an8}{\pos(192.9,200)}這應該很簡單  他們幸福  滿足  似乎無欲無求

574
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:03,800
{\an8}{\pos(192.9,218)}所以我才緊張

575
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:07,640
{\an8}{\pos(192.9,200)}對這種人我們沒什么辦法  而且  我也不信真是這樣

576
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:12,390
{\an8}{\pos(192.9,200)}不是每個人都像你那么不開心  親愛的

577
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,820
{\an8}{\pos(192.9,218)}而且  即使他們真的很滿足

578
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:24,070
{\an8}{\pos(192.9,218)}或是無欲無求  他們也會有所欲求的

579
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:28,830
{\an8}{\pos(192.9,200)}你只需要奪走他們已有的

580
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:35,190
他們為什么退出了
Why are they backing out?

581
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:38,410
這是圖書館
This is a library.

582
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:40,840
你想說那事  上實時聊天去
You want to discuss that, go back to the irc island.

583
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,820
他們把我拉黑了
They banned me from the channel!

584
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,480
怎么回事
What happened?

585
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:45,980
我們拿下鋼山了
We just owned Steel Mountain.

586
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,590
我們做到我們的部分了  十分順利
We did our part, and it went perfect.

587
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:49,080
得了  我們都知道那種事不可能完全順利
Come on, we both know that shit didn't go perfect.

588
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,350
那也無所謂了  他們不干了
Well, it doesn't matter! They called it off.

589
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:52,680
我們做到了我們這邊
We pulled our side together,

590
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,080
你們那邊卻沒事人一樣的不干了
and your side called it off like it was nothing.

591
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:56,360
你已經得到回答了
You got your answer.

592
00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:00,470
去告訴你伙計白玫瑰  別那么慫
You better tell your pal WhiteRose to stop being a pussy

593
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:01,970
有點膽
and start growing a pair

594
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:04,420
我們可沒時間瞎胡鬧
because we don't have time to dilly-dally around--

595
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:06,750
你現在還要明目張膽地說這事了
And now you're gonna talk about this in the world?

596
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:09,640
你在不在乎被人聽到啊
Do you even care who hears you?

597
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:12,520
面對現實吧  達琳
Face it, Darlene.

598
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,520
結束了
It's over.

599
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:15,190
放棄吧
Walk away.

600
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:18,670
我不能帶著這種結果回去見我的人
I can't go back to my people with that.

601
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,530
告訴我為什么
Tell me why.

602
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:23,650
你說過黑暗軍團會支持我們的
You said the Dark Army was with us on this.

603
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:29,760
就我們倆說說
Between us?

604
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:32,130
我又不會去發推特
I'm not about to goddamn tweet about it.

605
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:38,440
你們控制鋼山之前他們就退出了
They were out before you ever got to Steel Mountain.

606
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,440
我不知道為什么  他們只說了這么多
I don't know why. That's all they said to me.

607
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,500
我知道你下了決心
I know you had your heart set,

608
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,010
但這次真的
but for real this time,

609
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:49,570
放棄吧
just let it go.

610
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,580
-我需要席位  -不是吧
- I need seats mostly. - No.

611
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:14,000
我覺得在政府工作肯定很刺激
I imagine it must be exciting to work in government.

612
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,420
就像間諜電影里那樣
It's like a spy movie.

613
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,370
你能讀我的秘密電郵嗎
Can you read my secret emails?

614
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,850
不能
Mm, no.

615
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,340
我的工作主要是處理文件和手續工作
My job is mostly paperwork and bureaucracy.

616
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:24,720
他們總想要科技尚達不到的東西
They always want more than the technology allows.

617
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:28,220
我根本沒時間偷看你的秘密電郵
I don't even have time to read your secret emails.

618
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,350
這對我只是暫時的
But it's a stopgap for me.

619
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:31,790
我待不住
I'm restless.

620
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,910
總想換點花樣
I'm always itching for something else.

621
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:36,400
她換過不少呢
There have been a lot of something elses.

622
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,190
我們都是
For both of us.

623
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:41,850
在這之前  我在一家非政府組織工作
Before this, I worked at an ngo,

624
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:45,210
再之前在微軟干了一年
and before that, I worked at Microsoft for a year,

625
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:48,070
簡直度日如年
which felt like a decade.

626
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:54,060
你家真漂亮
Your place is beautiful.

627
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,790
我真想說謝謝
I wish I could take the compliment.

628
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:58,810
但裝飾是斯考特做的
The decorating is Scott's domain.

629
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,060
-是嗎  -是啊
- Oh, really? - Yes.

630
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,600
-不錯啊  -嗯
- Very nice. - Yeah.

631
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,120
古董都是哪里的
Where's all the-- the antiques from?

632
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,250
是...
They're--

633
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:08,730
他們要找你做首席技術官啊
So they tapped you for CTO, yes?

634
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,210
別那么驚訝
Don't be surprised.

635
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:15,860
應該說是懷疑
Suspicious is more accurate.

636
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:18,610
我還在想你為什么安排這頓晚餐呢
I was beginning to wonder why you set this dinner.

637
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,280
這世上只有4個人
Four people in the world

638
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:25,080
知道這事
know about my conversations.

639
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:29,120
但你卻不知怎么也知道了
Somehow you're number five.

640
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,940
那我正是你需要的副手人選
Then I'm exactly what you need in a right hand.

641
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:36,310
原來是為了這個
So that's what this is about.

642
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:38,890
每件事的背后不是都有個目的嗎
Isn't everything about something?

643
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:41,860
我們在考慮  是不是兒童防護的
Like, we were thinking about, is it--is it babyproof?

644
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:44,490
是啊  這的確是要考慮
Ah, yeah, that's-- that's a consideration.

645
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,230
如果你是我
If you were me,

646
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:49,290
會信任你做副手嗎
would you trust you as your right hand?

647
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,570
如果我是你
If I were you,

648
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:53,950
都不會放我進門
I wouldn't have even let me in the house.

649
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:15,900
是我
Hey, it's me.

650
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:17,070
現在方便嗎
Is now a good time?

651
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,390
嗯
Yeah.

652
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,860
我在我的新工作這兒
I'm at my new job.

653
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:22,350
怎么樣了
How's it going?

654
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:25,080
老實說  好難啊
Seriously, it's hard as hell,

655
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,990
不過  我慢慢掌握了
but I am getting the hang of it.

656
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,740
起初  把番茄醬倒在一起我弄了半天
At first, it took me, like, years to marry ketchups,

657
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:33,640
但是呢  我高價賣雞尾酒是個好手
but it turns out I'm amazing at upselling expensive cocktails.

658
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:35,850
這我不奇怪
I'm not surprised.

659
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:38,180
拼外賣單時
And then when I have to put together to-go orders,

660
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:40,930
發現跟裝搖頭丸很像  我做得可專業了
it's like bagging molly, so I'm, like, kind of an expert.

661
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:41,940
你怎么樣
How are you?

662
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:44,740
我挺好
I'm good.

663
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:49,580
是啊  這話我從沒聽你說過呢
Wow, I've never heard you say a sentence like that before, ever.

664
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,790
我今天做了我必須做的
I did what I had to do today.

665
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:56,550
如果你今晚在
Well, if you're around tonight,

666
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:58,850
過來跟我說說吧
come over and tell me about it, okay?

667
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,550
我得掛了
I got to go.

668
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,150
嗯  再見
Okay, bye.

669
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,700
你似乎很懂酒啊
You seem to know how to drink your wine.

670
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:23,930
我喜歡的東西不多  但確實很喜歡紅酒
I indulge in few things, but I do love wine.

671
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,630
你呢
Yourself?

672
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:28,840
我還能喝的時候很喜歡
In my other life, when I could drink for one.

673
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,500
但就算那時我品味也挺差的
But even then I had cheap tastes.

674
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:34,440
聞聞不要緊
It's safe to smell, though.

675
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:35,950
伸鼻子進去聞聞
Put your nose in there.

676
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:42,290
我聞著跟別的酒沒什么區別
You know, to me, it smells like every wine.

677
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:44,740
但我很想學學
But I'd love to learn.

678
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:50,690
干紅果  鮮紫羅蘭
Dried red fruit, fresh violet,

679
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:53,180
檸檬皮
uh, lemon peel.

680
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:55,410
再試試
Try it again.

681
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,910
好好聞  好好想
Smell and really-- really think about it.

682
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,840
我是聞得到檸檬
Mmm, I do smell lemon.

683
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,860
-莎朗  -怎么
- Sharon? - Yeah?

684
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:08,220
你嫁給這種人怎么沒悶死啊
How do you not blow your brains out being married to him?

685
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:10,160
什么
Excuse me?

686
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:12,760
要我再重復一次嗎
Shall I repeat the question?

687
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:15,870
你是我們的客人
You're a guest in our house.

688
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:17,910
我是位誠實的客人
A very honest one.

689
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:28,110
我就錯把你的話當作沒品的笑話
I think I'll mistake what you said as a joke in poor taste

690
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,120
然后起身去洗手間了
and excuse myself to the bathroom.

691
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:35,900
我這邊還有瓶不錯的陳釀
I have a beautiful vintage over here.

692
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,880
我給你看看牌子
I would love to just show you the label.

693
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,640
我看看
Let's see here.

694
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:46,530
不對
Nope.

695
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:48,860
不對
Nope.

696
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,130
就是這個
There's the one.

697
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:55,320
這是我最珍貴的珍藏
This is my prized possession, actually.

698
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,350
看看吧
Take a look at this.

699
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:01,680
我在用
I'm in here.

700
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,300
有事嗎
Can I help you?

701
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:47,500
今晚很愉快  多謝了
Thank you for a lovely evening.

702
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:11,290
大獲全勝
Siege in stormstout!

703
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,410
殺敵無數
Carcass emblem!

704
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,530
我們有麻煩了
We got problems.

705
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:16,960
樹莓派上線了嗎
Is the pi online?

706
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:18,660
嗯  我們侵入了整個系統了
Yeah, we're in the whole system.

707
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,860
只要我們想  可以馬上植入病毒
We could deliver the whole payload right now if we wanted.

708
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,850
但卻沒有鼓掌聲
And yet I hear no applause.

709
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,040
鼓掌
Applaud.

710
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:31,800
你得告訴他們
You have to tell them.

711
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:34,780
怎么了
What?

712
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:36,880
我們失去了中國那邊
We lost China.

713
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:38,710
什么
I'm sorry?

714
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:40,480
黑暗軍團不干了
The Dark Army is bailing.

715
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:42,490
為什么
Why?

716
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:45,270
看來他們不提供解釋
They don't answer whys apparently.

717
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,360
沒事  我們把他們叫回來就行
That's no problem. We'll just call 'em back.

718
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,010
盡快再安排一次見面
We'll set up another meet asap--

719
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:50,260
伙計  你沒聽到嗎
Dude, did you not hear me?

720
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,640
他們已經消失了  不可能了
They've gone dark. It's not happening.

721
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:03,140
我知道
I know. I know.

722
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:05,250
我知道  我搞砸了
I get it, okay? I f---ed up.

723
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,220
夏拉

724
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,120
我們別等了
Let's not wait, then.

725
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:20,880
我們動手吧  就我們自己
Let's do it anyway, just us.

726
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:22,390
我們馬上就動手
Let's do it right now.

727
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:24,620
好嗎  我們馬上執行
Okay? We execute now.

728
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:26,400
我們自己執行  寄希望于黑暗軍團
We execute on our side and trust that the Dark Army

729
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,120
能振作起來  跟上步伐
gets their shit together and follows.

730
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,590
憑什么讓他們決定啊
Why do they get to dictate terms?

731
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:30,900
該我們來決定
We dictate terms!

732
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:31,680
我們可以馬上開始
We can go now.

733
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,180
如果我們行動了  而他們沒有
If we move forward and they don't,

734
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,370
中國那邊還是有全部冗余備份
China still holds all the redundant information.

735
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:36,400
那就毫無意義了
It will be pointless.

736
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,130
如果我們等  也就沒戲了
And if we wait, it'll also be pointless.

737
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:41,900
你們今天做的一切都白費了
Everything you guys did today would be for nothing.

738
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,090
天吶  你瘋了嗎
God, are you crazy?

739
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:49,150
那樣毫無效力
It will have no effect!

740
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,190
能搞垮他們的網絡數周
It'll take down their network for weeks.

741
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:52,170
他們會恢復的
They'll recover.

742
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:53,230
還是能傷到他們
It would still hurt them.

743
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:54,700
我們不想傷他們
We don't want to hurt them!

744
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,660
我們想殺了他們
We want to kill them!

745
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,540
如果我們現在無所作為這兩樣都別指望了
And neither will happen if we do nothing right now.

746
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:03,430
你干什么呢
What are you doing, huh?

747
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:05,600
再走一步我就動手了
Take another step, and I'll do it.

748
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:09,830
好好想想你在做什么
Think about what you're doing, okay?

749
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:10,930
好嗎
All right?

750
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:13,190
只需要一個月  他們就又能重新運轉了
In a month, they're gonna be up and running again

751
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,750
而且安保會更好
with even better security.

752
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:16,710
我們再也不會有第二次機會了
We are not gonna get another shot at this.

753
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,670
我們一直在說的革命
The revolution that we've always talked about

754
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:21,360
就完蛋了  沒戲了
will be gone, dead, and buried.

755
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:24,710
我們會因為你  而失敗
We will have failed because of you.

756
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:29,080
別這么做
Please do not do this.

757
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:39,870
你們有誰能跟這女人說理嗎
Is there anyone here who can communicate with this woman?

758
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,210
求你
Please.

759
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,350
告訴我可以執行
Tell me it's okay to execute.

760
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:30,670
但我們就差一點了啊
But we were so close.

761
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:41,490
沒有結束
It's not over.

762
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:43,780
我們重新研究
We'll rework it.

763
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:45,070
我們會想到辦法的
We'll figure something out.

764
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:47,120
我們都走到這一步了
We got this far.

765
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,800
我們會找到辦法的  只是不是今晚
We'll find a way, just not tonight.

766
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,400
這都怪我
This is all my fault.

767
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:11,160
行了
Come on.

768
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:13,400
你可以去我家睡
You can crash at my place.

769
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,090
我父親有一天去學校接我
My father picked me up from school one day,

770
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:29,260
我們翹課  去了海灘
and we played hooky and went to the beach.

771
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,000
水太冷  不能下去
It was too cold to go in the water,

772
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,440
我們就坐在一塊毯子上吃披薩
so we sat on a blanket and ate pizza.

773
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:38,630
我回到家后  鞋里都是沙子
When I got home, my sneakers were full of sand,

774
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,910
我都倒在臥室地板上了
and I dumped it on my bedroom floor.

775
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,040
我當時也不懂事
I didn't know the difference.

776
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,040
我才6歲
I was six.

777
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:46,850
我媽媽為我弄得那么臟大吼我
My mother screamed at me for the mess,

778
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:48,150
{\pos(214.5,222.8)}逾期未付

779
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,300
但他卻不生氣
But he wasn't mad.

780
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,400
他說數十億年前
He said that billions of years ago,

781
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,590
世界變遷  滄海桑田
the world shifting and the oceans moving

782
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:54,970
才把那粒沙子帶上了那片海灘
brought that sand to that spot on the beach,

783
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:56,450
然后卻被我帶走了
and then I took it away.

784
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:58,150
他說  "每天
"Every day," He said,

785
00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:00,700
我們都會改變世界"  想想還挺不錯的
"We change the world," which is a nice thought

786
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:00,410
{\an1}逾期未付金額

787
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:00,780
{\an1}逾期未付金額

788
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:00,950
{\an1}逾期未付金額

789
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:01,660
{\an1}逾期未付金額

790
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:00,490
{\an1}E公司保險

791
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:00,830
{\an1}E公司保險

792
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:01,660
{\an1}E公司保險

793
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:03,260
但我又想到  我要花幾輩子
until I think about how many days and lifetimes

794
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:05,540
揣一鞋的沙子回家
I would need to bring a shoe full of sand home

795
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:07,430
海灘才會消失
until there is no beach,

796
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:09,940
才會真正影響任何人
until it made a difference to anyone.

797
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:12,640
每一天  我們都改變世界
Every day, we change the world,

798
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:15,530
但如果想做出任何有意義的改變
but to change the world in a way that means anything,

799
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:17,980
這需要大部分人沒有的時間
that takes more time than most people have.

800
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:20,090
而且從不會一下就做到
It never happens all at once.

801
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:23,730
這過程很慢
It's slow.

802
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:25,200
有條不紊
It's methodical.

803
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:26,660
讓人疲憊
It's exhausting.

804
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,780
不是每個人都能承受得住
We don't all have the stomach for it.

805
00:42:56,790 --> 00:42:57,650
親愛的
Hey, sweetie.

806
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:00,990
我去跑個步
I'm gonna go for a run.

807
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:03,730
好
Nice.

808
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:16,150
狗在夏拉那里
Shayla's got the dog.

809
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,410
她不在她枕頭上拉屎
She doesn't shit on her pillows.

810
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:22,130
那算是好事吧
That's a plus, I guess.

811
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,000
夏拉
Shayla?

812
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:39,990
伙計
Hey, brah.

813
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:43,990
有時候  宇宙的安排真奇妙
Sometimes the universe aligns perfectly.

814
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:46,040
我被關在這里
Here I am, locked away.

815
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:48,980
它卻還是能帶你來找我
Still, it brings you right to me.
