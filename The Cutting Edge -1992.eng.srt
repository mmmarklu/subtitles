1
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:23,814
(swishing)

2
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:41,457
It's 1:00. It's 1:00 in the afternoon.

3
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:42,833
I got a game!

4
00:00:43,918 --> 00:00:46,837
What the hell happened to the alarm?
I'm supposed to be on the ice.

5
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:47,963
You say, nein.

6
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:49,298
(woman speaks German)

7
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:52,593
- Yeah, nine. 9:00. What happened?
- Yeah, nein.

8
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,678
Badge. Shirt.

9
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:57,306
You say, "Nein alarm." Is mistake?

10
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:59,475
No. No mistake.

11
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:03,979
This is great. Late for the Olympics.
I'm just about four hours late, Rita.

12
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:07,608
- "Rita"?
- I don't believe this.

13
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:10,360
(laughs) "Rita"?

14
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:14,239
- Leta?
- "Leta"?

15
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,208
Anita.

16
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,376
Namen, Gita.

17
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:28,212
Gita!

18
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:31,507
(grunts)

19
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:35,844
(classical music plays)

20
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:03,497
- (man) This is the Olympics, Kate.
- (groaning)

21
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:06,458
Thirty million people called
their families in from the kitchen

22
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:08,710
to watch the replay.
What do you think this is, Kate?

23
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,380
Junior Pairs '82?

24
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:16,385
No. As I recall, in '82 you were
still humiliating me in private.

25
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,387
Maybe because
you were still listening.

26
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:23,183
If I'm going deaf, it's because I've had
you screaming in my ear for nine years!

27
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:26,353
He's not giving me anything
to work with.

28
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:29,189
Rick, this is impossible.

29
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:33,735
I wanna see your ass in the air.

30
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:47,624
Until Hercules here learns how
to lock his grip, this will have to do.

31
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:55,591
(laughter)

32
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,600
- (man) Name, son?
- Dorsey, US hockey.

33
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:06,852
(man) Hell, son,
they're just about to start.

34
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,902
Kate, this has to stop right now.

35
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:18,238
Rick knows what's best, honey.
He got us here.

36
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,741
How sweet. He lets us tag along.

37
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,619
You're gonna go back out there,
you're going to apologize

38
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,454
and you're gonna get to work.

39
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:28,290
I wouldn't bet the ranch, Dad.

40
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:31,543
- Where do you think you're going?
- (Kate) I'll be in my cell.

41
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:39,468
(? "The Star-Spangled Banner")

42
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:59,446
(grunting)

43
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:00,989
(Kate) What... What are you?

44
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:04,451
Does this go up to the ice?
Does this go up to the ice?

45
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,536
- What?
- Does this go up to the ice?

46
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:09,623
Is that all you have to say?
Were you raised in a barn?

47
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,668
Honey, where I'm from,
we stand for the national anthem.

48
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,845
(announcer) If you're just joining us
from the men's downhill,

49
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,681
you're in for a big surprise.

50
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:29,393
West Germany was supposed to be
an easy game for the United States,

51
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,854
but here in the third period
and West Germany is up by a goal.

52
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:36,525
Doug Dorsey, just about down
to the last dime of a two-minute penalty

53
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,860
- for high-sticking. He can't wait.
- Come on!

54
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:41,029
- Neither can the fans.
- Come on.

55
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:45,200
(crowd) Four, three, two, one.

56
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:49,079
(announcer) Dorsey running out of the
box. They'll hit him with the breakaway.

57
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:51,540
It's offside.

58
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,543
Doug Dorsey, the phenom
from Mayhorn, Minnesota.

59
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:57,212
(announcer 2) What a super story.
Here's a junior from Minnesota State.

60
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:59,089
Talk about being on the fast track.

61
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:01,133
There are at least 12 NHL clubs

62
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,802
that would love him on their roster
before the season's over.

63
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:06,638
An incredible young athlete.
If you haven't seen him before,

64
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:08,557
you're in for a real treat.

65
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:11,101
(announcer 1) No question,
we're talking about one of the finest

66
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:13,061
in amateur hockey today.

67
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:17,274
There was a piece this week. One writer
called him the "Minnesota Machine".

68
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,569
(crowd chanting) USA, USA, USA!

69
00:05:57,106 --> 00:06:00,108
(crowd cheering)

70
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:05,947
(grunting)

71
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:39,648
(classical music plays)

72
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,108
(whimpering)

73
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:26,445
(cameras clicking)

74
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:38,039
(man) For the record...

75
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:42,794
...you've lost 18 degrees
of peripheral vision in your right eye.

76
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:47,215
Now, in most cases, this would be
considered an inconvenience.

77
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:50,218
- But for a hockey player...
- So how long before it comes back?

78
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:56,892
You've had extreme trauma
to your occipital lobe.

79
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,393
Doc, how long?

80
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:02,898
You got a blind side, Doug.

81
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,362
It's a permanent condition.

82
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:12,532
- So there's an operation, right?
- I'm afraid not.

83
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:15,702
Some micro-laser thing.
You open me up and...

84
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:19,122
Doug, I've specialized in ophthalmic
surgery for over 15 years.

85
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:21,500
OK, you don't do it,
but somebody, somewhere.

86
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:24,461
Down in Mexico City,
they shoot shark piss up your nose,

87
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,379
make you sit in traction
for eight months.

88
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,257
Doug... I'm sorry.

89
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:33,345
I don't see professional hockey
in your future.

90
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:09,756
- See you at the game tonight, Doug.
- Not if I see you first.

91
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,050
- See you, Mike.
- Mike.

92
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:14,803
- Anybody seen my wife?
- See you guys later.

93
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,475
(woman on radio) Ice-time meltdown.

94
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:23,186
You're listening to WICV,
Duluth, Minnesota.

95
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:25,897
We're gonna warm you up...

96
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:36,283
- Hi, Doug.
- In a hurry. Any mail?

97
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,702
- No.
- I got a game. Make me a sandwich.

98
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,454
Hey, little brother,
Snyder can't make it. I need a hand.

99
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,540
- I got a game.
- Hi, Dougie.

100
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,293
- It's Friday night.
- Make me a sandwich.

101
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,296
- I need a hand.
- I need a sandwich.

102
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,715
Dougie, wait a minute.

103
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:56,553
Doug, I got no place else to go.

104
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:59,264
You're my brother, not my boss, OK?

105
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:02,350
Douglas, I'm not asking you,
I'm telling you.

106
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:06,730
Will you get off my back?
I'm no bartender. Get used to it.

107
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:10,984
What the hell's that supposed to mean?
What makes you so special?

108
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,111
You're playing
in a goddamn bar league.

109
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:15,030
Hey, Walt, at least I'm playing.

110
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:18,908
Hey. Your twenty-third letter?
Arrived today.

111
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:24,247
Detroit Red Wings.

112
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,209
It's over, little brother.
Everybody knows it but you.

113
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,880
- Give me that.
- "Doug, sorry about the eye.

114
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:34,883
- Next time you're in town, call."
- Give me that letter.

115
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:37,594
- "We'll buy you a ticket."
- Give me that goddamn letter!

116
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,722
What are you gonna do?!
You gonna fight me?

117
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,932
Are you gonna fight the world?
Everybody?

118
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,685
Well, put me on the list, pal.
Come on, let's go.

119
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:53,568
You want something to eat,
make it yourself.

120
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:17,133
(ice swishing)

121
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,889
(man) All right, Kate. Enough.

122
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,560
Lovely. Let's do it again.

123
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,487
Do we or do we not
have eight minutes left?

124
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:39,364
Enough for today.

125
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:44,327
Perhaps you are wanting
to take shower?

126
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:46,037
All right.

127
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,957
What he needs
is a ride to the airport.

128
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,627
I've got laundry that
can skate better than that.

129
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,138
He lasted a month.

130
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,473
You should've been making
her singles skater.

131
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:09,561
So where do we go from here?

132
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,773
Two years, eight partners.

133
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,484
This one too small.
That one too big. Too loud.

134
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,320
Too much sweat. Not enough sweat.

135
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:25,034
Jack, she is tremendous skater.
Everyone is saying this.

136
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,954
Petite. Powerful. Intelligent.

137
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,249
But always is coming the big "B".

138
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:34,169
What a bitch.

139
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,173
- What about Spindler?
- Spindler?

140
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:43,094
Spindler say before he skate with her

141
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,680
he wear garlic from neck
and sleep with cross.

142
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:50,894
Who is left? (speaks Russian)

143
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,855
I am at bottom of barrel.

144
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:57,358
Then you find another barrel.

145
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:15,210
(rock music plays)

146
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:26,554
You are bigger than I think.

147
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:32,519
- What?
- You are much bigger than I think.

148
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:38,066
I'm spending much time watching video
of you, Mr. Douglas Dorsey.

149
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,610
You are very exciting skater.

150
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:43,863
Look, if you're a reporter, you're
a little late. The story's been done.

151
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,615
No. I am coach.

152
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:48,451
What's the deal? You goof on me,
my brother buys you a beer?

153
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,371
What means "goof"?

154
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,876
- Are you the Swede?
- No, I'm Russian.

155
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,962
My name is Anton Pamchenko.

156
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:02,382
From the Leafs. I can't believe it.
You got my letter.

157
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:05,260
You couldn't have come at a better
time. I'm in the best shape of my life.

158
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:08,763
I'm skating five, six hours a night,
speed drills, stick drills, roadwork.

159
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:11,307
I am not hockey coach.

160
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:16,437
- What is this?
- Maybe nothing.

161
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:21,401
Here... You try.

162
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:26,114
(horn honking)

163
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,951
Those are figure skates, pal.

164
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,990
Whoa! I should've held out for more.

165
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,493
This way.

166
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:16,122
(classical piano music plays)

167
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:51,074
- You got your own rink.
- We have ice every day.

168
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,713
That's not Spindler.

169
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:07,966
Where the hell is Spindler?

170
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,551
- I thought you said he'd be here.
- No. You said Spindler.

171
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:14,889
This is Dorsey. Mr. Douglas Dorsey.

172
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:20,103
- Dorsey? Never heard of him.
- Douglas is beautiful skater.

173
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:25,108
Oh. You're that hockey player.

174
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:28,778
How you doing?

175
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,408
- Nice to meet you.
- (Pamchenko) Is tryout.

176
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,118
Is tryout.

177
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,339
Oh, my God.

178
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:50,258
What, my hand?

179
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,093
What do you do?
Soak them in battery acid?

180
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:55,638
I know they're rough, but I've never
had any complaints before.

181
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:57,890
Oh, I'm terribly impressed.

182
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:01,728
What is this, final stages
of Ukrainian alcohol psychosis?

183
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,730
Who's checking out who here?

184
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,065
I don't know how many slap shots
you've taken to the brain,

185
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:09,444
but this was your audition.
And let me assure you, it's over.

186
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:12,321
Snow White, I'm no figure skater.
I'm a hockey player.

187
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,198
Then what are you doing here?

188
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:19,495
Get him out of my building.

189
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,792
- What?
- Get him out of my building.

190
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:28,296
Temperamental?
I can think of another word for it.

191
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:31,090
- Is that what you told him?
- It's a big secret?

192
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,801
- Who do you think you are?
- I know exactly who I am.

193
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:35,678
A guy who came
a long way for lunch.

194
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:38,765
Please don't let me keep you
from the trough.

195
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:42,310
I'm sorry, buddy. I wouldn't wish this
on a snake. I'm out of here.

196
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:47,482
(shouts in Russian) Enough.

197
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:50,401
Introduction is over.
Conversation finished.

198
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:52,445
Mouths closed.
Ears to be opened.

199
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:56,115
Pairs means two.
You have no partner.

200
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:58,618
You're skating nowhere.

201
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:03,414
And where are you going?
Oh, back to Siberia?

202
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,667
Skating on small pond
is big excitement.

203
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:09,670
Believe me, Gretzky...

204
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:13,049
...I am last person
who's coming to look for you.

205
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,305
Good.

206
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,682
We skate.

207
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:25,019
(Pamchenko) You are
taking her left hand,

208
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:28,314
and your right hand is at her waist.

209
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:33,277
Good. The line is beautiful.

210
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:37,448
Now, I am counting a beat.
You push off on four.

211
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:38,950
- Katya will lead.
- Hey, hold on.

212
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,744
What's the deal with these claws
up front here?

213
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,456
- (Pamchenko) Is toe pick.
- Toe pick?

214
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:48,209
Let me guess. It has something
to do with personal hygiene.

215
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:52,547
- I wouldn't let that get in your way.
- I don't let anything get in my way.

216
00:18:55,717 --> 00:19:00,721
- Count it off.
- (Pamchenko speaks Russian)

217
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,890
And one and four.

218
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:07,186
Good. Good. Head up.

219
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:08,646
Yes. Arms up.

220
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:10,773
Katya, keep in line with him.

221
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:14,318
Is not race, Katya. Together. Together.

222
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:18,114
- What, you shower once a week?
- Is that an invitation?

223
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,782
(Pamchenko) Douglas, bend knees more.

224
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:22,410
- Good.
- Hey. Hey!

225
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,912
- (grunts)
- Oh, shit.

226
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,666
Toe pick.

227
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,170
(Kate laughing)

228
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,007
(Pamchenko) Katya, lift arms, please.

229
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:38,634
Go on. Lift arms.

230
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:43,764
Douglas, please to pick her up.

231
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:48,436
- Yeah?
- Yes. Pick up.

232
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,696
OK. Enough.

233
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:02,617
- We are finish.
- I told you this was ridiculous.

234
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:05,828
Would you please put me down?

235
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,581
Ah!

236
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,333
Oh!

237
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,293
You... You cretin!

238
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:16,005
- Guess that move needs some work.
- (groans)

239
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:23,971
(Doug) What a waste of good ice.

240
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:26,224
(Kate grunts)

241
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,767
Ridiculous.

242
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:33,022
(Jack) Stare at it long enough,

243
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:35,441
you'll start to see
an Olympic gold medal in there.

244
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,946
Jack Moseley. Sit down.
Sit down, please.

245
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,698
Look, I've spoken with Anton.

246
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:47,161
First of all, I want you to know the
simple fact that he brought you out...

247
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:50,331
You should feel proud. We're talking
about probably the greatest judge

248
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:52,458
of skating talent in the world.

249
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:55,836
Central Soviet Army Sports Club,
Moscow Ice Ballet, the works.

250
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:59,465
I saw you skate in Calgary.

251
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:02,134
You were a great, great hockey player.

252
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:05,429
So I don't want you to feel as though
this were a complete waste of time.

253
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:07,098
It was worth a shot.

254
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:11,394
- What, the eye?
- No, the eye's not a problem.

255
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,812
Is it your daughter?

256
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,024
Kate is Kate.

257
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:19,568
She's an only child,
raised without a mother.

258
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:21,195
The strain of competition.

259
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:26,575
Sudden changes tend
to bring out her... color.

260
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:28,202
Oh, is that what that was?

261
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:33,708
Frankly, the idea's just
a little too bizarre for me.

262
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,670
I believe you're
on a 10:30 flight, first class.

263
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,755
There's a check in there
for your trouble.

264
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:42,049
This is what you call
giving me a shot?

265
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:46,220
I don't have time to screw around.
I can't afford to be wrong about you.

266
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:48,556
We were 45 seconds away
from the gold medal.

267
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:53,144
Our boy dropped the ball. That goddamn
glass box is empty for one reason:

268
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,021
We can't find a go-to guy.

269
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:57,940
Thirty-five male skaters.

270
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:01,736
These boys have been doing this
for years and couldn't cut it.

271
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:05,614
Wagner, no stamina.

272
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:08,409
Myersohn, no rhythm.

273
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:10,745
Leone, Parnes, Hudler.

274
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:17,126
Not one single pressure player
in the bunch.

275
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:40,441
Lucky shot.

276
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:57,958
Double or nothing.

277
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:01,587
You're on.

278
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:09,095
(laughter)

279
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:12,306
Katie, there you are.

280
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:14,475
Hi. I was just coming
to say goodbye.

281
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:17,770
Hold that thought.
Doug is staying with us for a while.

282
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,480
- Good talking to you, Jack.
- Doug.

283
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:22,650
Catch your act tomorrow.

284
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:31,992
That's the end of the line, honey.

285
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,956
(Doug) If we're gonna work together,
try being polite.

286
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,208
(Kate) You're not gonna be here long
enough to make it worth the effort.

287
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:42,378
- Think I can't put up with your shit?
- I don't think you can skate.

288
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:45,339
There's two things I do
really well, sweetheart.

289
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:47,174
And skating's the other one.

290
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:50,094
God. You really are a Neanderthal.

291
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,346
I hate to tell you,
but I'm from Minnesota.

292
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:53,889
That's south of Neanderthal.

293
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:57,309
What do you do for fun,
polish your knife collection?

294
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:01,021
I'm sure there's nothing I do
that you'd find exciting.

295
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:03,274
I don't open beer bottles with my toes.

296
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,693
I don't sit around and count
what's left of my teeth.

297
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:09,071
Hey, I don't even enjoy
a good tractor pull.

298
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:11,991
Limited existence,
but I've gotten used to it.

299
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,743
Life of the party.
Place must be crawling with guys.

300
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:17,037
As a matter of fact,
I do have a boyfriend.

301
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:19,832
A rough gig. You keep him
chained up in the basement?

302
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:24,170
Hale, at the moment, is working
in my father's London office.

303
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,672
He's an MBA. Harvard.

304
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:29,925
You might've heard of it.
They do have a hockey team.

305
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:34,388
- He must be a very smart guy.
- (Pamchenko) First position.

306
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:36,599
Bet you look good
from a few thousand miles away.

307
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:39,435
(Pamchenko) OK, Douglas.

308
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:42,271
Come. Shoulders back.

309
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:45,065
Good, good. Now, chest out. Yes.

310
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:47,151
Shoulders back. Head higher.

311
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:52,573
When we're through, can we teach it
how to breathe with its mouth closed?

312
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:54,783
(Doug grunts)

313
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:58,537
(laughs) Don't quit your day job.

314
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:03,250
(Pamchenko) Man and woman
together make flower.

315
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:05,586
Douglas, you are stem.

316
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,421
Katya, you are petal.

317
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:09,757
Together, we make flower.

318
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:14,261
- (? Nia Peeples "Street of Dreams")
- Toe pick.

319
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:32,071
- (grunts)
- Toe pick.

320
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:50,631
(high-pitched) Toe pick. (laughs)

321
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,280
Whoa!

322
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:15,990
Dorsey back to Gretzky,
over to Esposito.

323
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:17,866
LaFontaine to Dorsey.
Dorsey to Gretzky.

324
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:20,494
Gretzky to Dorsey.
Dorsey shoots. He scores!

325
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,413
Yes!

326
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,508
If you're so bored, why don't you read?

327
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:35,676
You mean a book?

328
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:38,262
It is a traditionally
accepted format, yes.

329
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:41,890
Is this the beginning
of a conversation here?

330
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:44,143
I was just simply asking
if you knew how to read.

331
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:47,021
Yes. Doug can read.

332
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:49,064
What was the last book you read?

333
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:52,651
You were in college.

334
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:55,446
Last thing I read was a letter
canceling my scholarship

335
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:57,197
when I couldn't play anymore.

336
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:59,658
- OK. High school.
- I was a hockey player.

337
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,535
The only thing I had to read
was a scoreboard.

338
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:05,080
- And they graduated you?
- They revered me. I was a god.

339
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:08,000
What a tragic commentary
on our times.

00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:35,528
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.

513
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:37,322
- Yes, you did.
- No...

514
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:44,704
I came to give you this.

515
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:47,749
- What's that?
- It's our greatest hits.

516
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:51,919
It's a video for your family
of us skating.

517
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:55,757
- Thanks.
- My dad booked some extra rooms

518
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:58,384
in Chicago, and we'd love them
to stay with us.

519
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:01,721
- My family?
- Yes. To the Nationals.

520
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:05,058
- They're coming, aren't they?
- I don't know.

521
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:08,561
Look at all you've done.
They must be really excited.

522
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:10,313
(Hale) Honey, it's a 7:30 show.

523
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:12,398
- You better go.
- Why wouldn't they come?

524
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:14,734
They'll come, they're coming.
Hale's waiting.

525
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,235
How do you know
if you haven't told them?

526
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:17,862
- I'm gonna tell them.
- When?

527
00:44:18,572 --> 00:44:20,573
- Now. This weekend.
- You sure?

528
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:22,617
- Yeah, I'm sure.
- Really?

529
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:25,703
Kate, believe me.
I'm dying to tell them.

530
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:26,996
(horn honking)

531
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:37,173
(? Johnny Winter "Shame Shame Shame")

532
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:57,777
Dougie? Dougie!

533
00:44:59,279 --> 00:45:00,279
What?

534
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:03,366
(man) Doug. Hey, you're a captain now.

535
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:11,165
Come on, come on.

536
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:13,793
Hey, would you let him up
for air, dear. Come on.

537
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:17,755
I'll be a son of a bitch.

538
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:20,675
(laughing)

539
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:24,804
Man, it's good to see you.

540
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:26,681
Yeah, it's good to see you, too.

541
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:29,684
Hey! My brother Doug,
home from the Merchant Marine.

542
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:31,102
(cheering)

543
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:32,520
Did you forget
how to use the phone?

544
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:34,981
Come on. Move back, move back.

545
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:36,816
He's been cruising all over the world

546
00:45:36,942 --> 00:45:39,152
and he can't even get to the bar.
Come on.

547
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:43,281
Hey, Ensign Dorsey. No, no...
Lieutenant, Captain Dorsey, huh?

548
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:47,535
- Cool it with the Merchant Marine.
- What? Sh, sh!

549
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:50,371
- What?
- I didn't join the Merchant Marine.

550
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:53,124
- (man) Still got your sea legs?
- Sh!

551
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:56,711
If you weren't with the
Merchant Marine, where were you?

552
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:59,505
Let's go outside
and talk about this.

553
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:03,176
- We're all family here.
- (man) Tell us about it.

554
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:04,969
Come on. Tell me now.

555
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:07,847
(man) Come on, chief.

556
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:12,101
Well, actually,
it's kind of interesting.

557
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:14,854
Tell him.

558
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:22,695
I've been doing a little...

559
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:26,574
Been doing a little figure skating.

560
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,534
- Damn.
- (man) What'd he say?

561
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:31,204
You been doing what?

562
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:33,331
(man) Finger painting?

563
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:39,545
These people, they think
we can go all the way.

564
00:46:39,671 --> 00:46:41,172
All the way to where?

565
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:46,135
To the Nationals. Walter, the cham...

566
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:48,846
You just don't understand.

567
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,224
Was it me? Was it something I did?

568
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:53,226
I'm telling you, I'm good.

569
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:57,647
Come on, Doug, you're a hockey player.
How good can you be?

570
00:46:57,773 --> 00:47:00,525
Face it. If you're lucky,
a year from now

571
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:04,111
you're gonna be in a Snoopy costume
in the frigging Ice Capades.

572
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:07,073
You know me better than that. You think
I'd spend 15 hours a day, every day,

573
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:09,659
to win some consolation prize?

574
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:12,787
- I'm talking an Olympic gold medal.
- It's the girl.

575
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:14,914
You're mixed up with this broad.
That's it, isn't it?

576
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:18,251
- It's a great opportunity.
- It's figure skating.

577
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:20,920
And I like it!

578
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:24,674
It's a lot goddamn harder than
playing hockey, I can tell you that.

579
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,301
And the stuff we're doing,
it's gonna be different.

580
00:47:27,427 --> 00:47:31,389
The costumes, the music.
Everything is gonna be different.

581
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:33,307
You'll see.

582
00:47:38,063 --> 00:47:40,231
Are they gonna make you
shave your legs?

583
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:42,066
Screw this. I don't even know why...

584
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:43,651
(laughing)

585
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:47,446
Gotcha.

586
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:49,991
(man) Ah!

587
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:53,202
Good. This is looking good. Now.

588
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:57,957
- Oh, I like it.
- It's not too low, is it?

589
00:47:58,083 --> 00:48:01,127
(man) Well, we don't want him to hide
his light under a basket, do we?

590
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:05,381
Now, where to put this? Here. Here.

591
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:09,302
I know.

592
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:11,804
(beads falling on ground)

593
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:14,932
Let's put it here.

594
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:18,311
- What do you think you're doing?
- Just getting started.

595
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:26,652
(rock music plays)

596
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:28,946
(switches to classical music)

597
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:30,156
This is Mozart.

598
00:48:31,366 --> 00:48:34,869
- It's not us.
- The deal was that we had to listen.

599
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:38,331
Kate, this is tired.

600
00:48:38,498 --> 00:48:41,334
Ten thousand other skaters will be
cueing up the same boring crap.

601
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:45,338
This doesn't get it done.
It's like the costumes.

602
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:47,506
- Let's be different.
- (switches to rock music)

603
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:49,508
Let's kick a little ass.

604
00:48:50,135 --> 00:48:52,178
If you wanna see some asses kicked,

605
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:55,014
why don't you throw on some jeans
and skate to this.

606
00:48:55,515 --> 00:48:57,058
(switches to classical, turns up volume)

607
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:59,644
If you wanna win, you play it straight.

608
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,854
This is boring.

609
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:06,359
(rock music, turns up volume)

610
00:49:06,526 --> 00:49:09,904
- Unacceptable!
- (classical music, turns up volume)

611
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:12,865
(rock music, turns up volume)

612
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:15,493
- (Kate) Would you stop?
- Didn't work for you last time!

613
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:17,036
What?

614
00:49:17,162 --> 00:49:19,246
- You heard me!
- (classical music, turns up volume)

615
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:22,917
- You have some nerve!
- Just listen to my music one second!

616
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:25,044
- (Kate) Stop turning it!
- (loud rock music)

617
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:27,213
- (switching music)
- Guys.

618
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:29,715
Hey!

619
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:32,677
(turns off music)

620
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,720
It's after midnight.

621
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:36,514
I have a 6:30 appointment.

622
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,432
We were just wrapping up.

623
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:43,604
Play him the Mozart.
You'll be asleep in no time.

624
00:49:49,736 --> 00:49:54,156
Katya, please try to understand.
Douglas is not boy. He is man.

625
00:49:54,282 --> 00:49:57,243
- Is young, vigorous man.
- I don't care what you call him.

626
00:49:57,411 --> 00:50:00,204
He has three months to qualify for the
Nationals. He needs every minute.

627
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:03,290
Sure, sure. This I know.
And he is back on Monday.

628
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:06,585
- And he will be working much better.
- Really?

629
00:50:09,214 --> 00:50:11,257
Katya, please, you know.

630
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:14,635
Solitude is...
Too much is not good, eh?

631
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:17,263
It's Christmas, we skate.
I have the flu, we skate.

632
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:19,598
I have a boyfriend in London
that I never see.

633
00:50:19,766 --> 00:50:23,394
I skate every day so that you can play
Dr. Frankenstein with this guy.

634
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,980
I show up every morning
for seven months

635
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:29,817
so that you can give him two days
to go off whoring in New York City?

636
00:50:29,943 --> 00:50:32,278
Is not entirely correct.

637
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:35,114
He went to Boston.

638
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:41,514
(Doug) If I get her any higher,

639
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:44,517
they'll need a putty knife to scrape
her off the ceiling. Am I right?

640
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:45,643
(laughter)

641
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:47,853
- Are we ready for Nationals or what?
- (Pamchenko) We will be.

642
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:51,649
- (Kate) Celebrating? We haven't won.
- To you, Doug.

643
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:55,611
(Kate) Who's ready to order? I think
I'll start with some vichyssoise.

644
00:51:55,737 --> 00:51:59,365
Five weeks to go. Everything's starting
to click. We're gonna kick some tail.

645
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:01,784
- Am I right?
- (Kate) "Tail"? Excuse me?

646
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:03,494
- (Pamchenko) Some beluga.
- I'm eligible.

647
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,037
Doug Dorsey, licensed to thrill.

648
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:07,039
Slow down, champ.
We've got a long way to go.

649
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:09,917
- Trying to rain on my parade?
- Don't let her beat you down.

650
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:12,169
Hasn't happened by now,
he's in the clear.

651
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:14,755
You're standing there doing nothing.
Get our menu.

652
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:18,551
- Now is not the time.
- (Doug) Any specials or what?

653
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:20,219
(Hale) Everyone's in such a great mood.

654
00:52:20,345 --> 00:52:23,389
- I'll throw another log on the fire.
- Hale, now is not the time.

655
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:26,684
(Hale) They'll find out sooner or later.
The fact is

656
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:29,895
I've asked Kate to marry me,
and she's accepted.

657
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:34,191
- (Pamchenko) Fantastic.
- (Jack) Oh, Hale, congratulations.

658
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:35,901
- (Hale) Thank you.
- (Jack) Congratulations.

659
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:40,156
- That's great.
- (Pamchenko) Katya, I want my kiss.

660
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:42,408
- (Hale) Show them the ring, Kate.
- That's just great.

661
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:44,952
(Jack) Now, there's a piece of ice.

662
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:47,746
Hale, I think I'm paying
you altogether too much.

663
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:49,832
- (Pamchenko) What are you doing?
- (Kate) We ready to order?

664
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:51,709
- Yeah.
- (Jack) Sure.

665
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:12,605
(? Sally Dworsky "Turning Circles")

666
00:53:52,854 --> 00:53:54,730
(Rick) Still dropping that shoulder.

667
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:58,984
I thought you'd retired.

668
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:02,571
I changed my mind.

669
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:08,619
You know what I think
is the saddest thing about sports?

670
00:54:09,996 --> 00:54:11,914
People who stay too long
at the party.

671
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:16,460
- What are you doing here, Rick?
- I'd like to see you go out a champion.

672
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:18,504
That's my plan.

673
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:22,841
If you wanted to skate so badly,
why didn't you come to me?

674
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:25,844
- I know we've made some mistakes.
- Mistakes?

675
00:54:26,012 --> 00:54:28,847
You spent the last ten years
tying me into knots.

676
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:30,516
You were always difficult.

677
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:35,521
You know what the first thing
you said to me was?

678
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:38,315
I was nine years old,
and you came into my building.

679
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:39,608
And I was skating.

680
00:54:39,734 --> 00:54:42,695
And when I was finished,
I turned around,

681
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:45,322
and, oh, my God, there was Rick Tuttle.

682
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:47,241
And you know what you said?

683
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:50,244
You said, "Boy, do we have
our work cut out for us."

684
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:54,373
Still blaming Calgary on Brian?

685
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:57,543
You meant a lot to this sport, Kate.
You still do.

686
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:02,006
But Nationals?
I mean, now, after all this time?

687
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:06,218
I just hate to see you... humiliated.

688
00:55:06,344 --> 00:55:10,139
- Humiliated?
- (chuckles) Oh, come on. This guy.

689
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:13,183
A hockey player? Let's face it.

690
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:16,270
Trusting partners
was never your strong suit.

691
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:20,190
This guy, this hockey player,

692
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:22,276
is the best skater
I've been on the ice with.

693
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:25,112
He gonna make you cry, he's so good.

694
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:29,908
You know your way out.

695
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:48,344
I swear, you let me down,
it'll take them a month

696
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:50,095
to count the blade marks up your back.

697
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:53,766
Do me a favor, take off
the rock while we work.

698
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:56,518
It's cutting the hell out of my hand.

699
00:56:04,819 --> 00:56:07,529
(announcer) The United States
Figure Skating Association

700
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:10,616
welcomes you to the National
Skating Championships in Chicago.

701
00:56:12,285 --> 00:56:14,703
Congratulations, and the best of luck.

702
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:21,960
Douglas, free leg must be high.
Katya, head low.

703
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:24,797
Yes, your body must be tight.

704
00:56:24,964 --> 00:56:27,299
- (Doug) Like rush hour out here.
- (Kate) Spindler and Nyman.

705
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:28,926
They cry on command.

706
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:33,180
Ah. The Weiderman twins. Don't get too
close. You'll go into sugar shock.

707
00:56:34,015 --> 00:56:37,476
- Hey, isn't that?
- (Kate) Brian Neuman.

708
00:56:37,602 --> 00:56:39,937
- My old partner.
- The ex-husband.

709
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:42,272
Who's the new wife?

710
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:45,567
(Kate) Pekurovsky. Lorie Pekurovsky.

711
00:56:45,693 --> 00:56:47,361
Tell me how you really feel.

712
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:53,450
(Brian) Well, Kate.

713
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:56,912
- Surprise, surprise.
- Hello, Brian.

714
00:57:03,128 --> 00:57:05,421
No wonder you've been
keeping him to yourself.

715
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,848
- (Kate) What's the matter?
- Nothing.

716
00:57:16,307 --> 00:57:18,016
Don't worry. You'll get used to it.

717
00:57:19,018 --> 00:57:20,519
Yeah, right.

718
00:57:30,572 --> 00:57:33,031
(elevator dings, door opens)

719
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:37,661
Going down?

720
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:47,087
You talked me into it.

721
00:57:50,383 --> 00:57:54,511
(Lorie laughing)

722
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:56,513
- Hello.
- Hey.

723
00:57:57,390 --> 00:57:59,057
- (Doug) How you doing?
- I'm well.

724
00:57:59,851 --> 00:58:02,060
- See you around.
- OK. Just get in?

725
00:58:02,228 --> 00:58:04,354
- (Hale) Yes.
- I thought you were napping.

726
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:06,231
I couldn't sleep. I wasn't tired.

727
00:58:10,403 --> 00:58:13,739
God! He has the self control
of a rabbit.

728
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:16,033
Kate, what are you looking for?

729
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:17,743
Nothing. My earring.

730
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:20,370
I spend four years working
my way back to Nationals

731
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:22,748
and what happens?
I'm skating to weird music

732
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:26,210
with a partner who can't even follow
the simplest of instructions.

733
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:28,587
Maybe he's got a problem sleeping.

734
00:58:28,713 --> 00:58:32,049
The only problem that he has
is finding his zipper fast enough.

735
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:34,426
I thought they looked good together.

736
00:58:34,552 --> 00:58:37,596
You think this is funny?
We have to skate tonight.

737
00:58:37,722 --> 00:58:39,765
- Now is the time to rest.
- Like you, huh?

738
00:58:41,226 --> 00:58:43,101
That's it. That is it.

739
00:58:43,937 --> 00:58:46,730
Call the front desk
and get a room of your own!

740
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:49,608
I knew this wouldn't work out.
I can't even concentrate.

741
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:51,818
I can't even find my lucky earring!

742
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:55,614
Hello.

743
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:10,963
This hasn't got anything
to do with skating.

744
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:14,466
- What does that mean?
- You're falling for him.

745
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:17,844
- What?
- Doug.

746
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:20,305
- (laughs) Yes.
- You are. You're falling for him.

747
00:59:20,473 --> 00:59:22,641
- That's crazy.
- You think so?

748
00:59:22,767 --> 00:59:24,643
- You're nuts.
- Am I?

749
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:27,354
- You see how we act together.
- Yes, I do.

750
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:29,940
We never get along.
I mean, we're always fighting.

751
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:32,526
Foreplay.

752
00:59:46,374 --> 00:59:49,126
- OK, we're all in.
- You are not waiting for Hale?

753
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:52,546
He's not coming. He had to go up
to Boston. Business problems.

754
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:54,548
Is OK with you?

755
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:58,635
If you wanna worry about something,
worry about ramjet the rookie here.

756
01:00:00,054 --> 01:00:01,305
Who?

757
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:05,767
Let's go.

758
01:00:07,979 --> 01:00:12,149
(woman) So here we are at night number
four of the US National Championships.

759
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:14,901
The country's 12 best couples
are in the arena tonight.

760
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:16,403
(man) Only two of these couples

761
01:00:16,529 --> 01:00:20,198
will go on to the Olympics in
Albertville, France six weeks from now.

762
01:00:20,366 --> 01:00:23,201
(woman) Tonight we're seeing two and a
half minutes in the compulsory moves

763
01:00:23,328 --> 01:00:26,580
before tomorrow night's long program.

764
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:28,457
(jazz plays)

765
01:00:31,544 --> 01:00:33,962
(classical music plays)

766
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:40,135
(applause)

767
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:50,979
(laughs) You look nervous.

768
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:54,524
You look really nervous.

769
01:00:57,654 --> 01:01:03,116
How nervous are you?

770
01:01:03,242 --> 01:01:06,203
(applause)

771
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:10,874
(retching)

772
01:01:15,546 --> 01:01:17,464
(Doug continues retching)

773
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:35,190
(whispers) I feel better.

774
01:01:35,316 --> 01:01:37,567
What is wrong with you?

775
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:39,861
I always get tight before a game.

776
01:01:40,947 --> 01:01:45,575
Put it this way. When I played hockey,
I used to have two helmets.

777
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:49,121
One for the game,
and one forjust before.

778
01:01:49,288 --> 01:01:52,582
- This just coming up now?
- Bad choice of words.

779
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:55,043
(applause)

780
01:01:56,838 --> 01:01:59,297
Beautiful skating. Just beautiful.

781
01:02:06,347 --> 01:02:08,140
I don't believe this.

782
01:02:08,307 --> 01:02:10,183
I'm fine. No problem.

783
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:12,394
(Kate) Don't sweat it.

784
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:17,816
- Look at me.
- (man) Miss Moseley, Mr. Dorsey,

785
01:02:17,942 --> 01:02:19,818
- you're on.
- Look at my eyes, look at my eyes.

786
01:02:19,986 --> 01:02:22,487
That's good. OK. Now, smile.

787
01:02:23,489 --> 01:02:25,490
Concentrate on my forehead.

788
01:02:25,658 --> 01:02:28,910
OK. Now, look at me and smile.

789
01:02:29,036 --> 01:02:30,954
There you go. There. Bigger.

790
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:33,331
OK. Now, breathe.

791
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:35,375
Breathe!

792
01:02:37,211 --> 01:02:39,296
Just don't breathe on me, OK?

793
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:40,714
Look, it goes away.

794
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:45,469
The worst it was, I went out and scored
six goals in the first two periods.

795
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:49,639
(announcer) Next to skate,
Kate Moseley, Douglas Dorsey.

796
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:52,225
- (applause)
- (man) Miss Moseley, Mr. Dorsey,

797
01:02:52,351 --> 01:02:54,853
- please.
- You're saying once we get out there

798
01:02:54,979 --> 01:02:56,521
everything will be fine?

799
01:02:56,647 --> 01:02:59,357
It usually only took me
about ten minutes to relax.

800
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:02,652
Our program is two and a half minutes.

801
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:06,698
So eight minutes after
we're done, I'll be fine.

802
01:03:09,994 --> 01:03:12,204
(applause)

803
01:03:12,371 --> 01:03:15,207
(man) So here they are, former
US champion Kate Moseley

804
01:03:15,374 --> 01:03:18,543
and ex-hockey star Doug Dorsey
at their first Nationals.

805
01:03:18,711 --> 01:03:21,213
And what a place to make
your competitive debut.

806
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:24,800
(engine revving)

807
01:03:27,845 --> 01:03:30,931
(? Yello "The Race")

808
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:50,575
(woman) Side by side double axels.
Here they come.

809
01:03:56,415 --> 01:04:00,043
(man) And they nailed them.
They nailed them just beautifully.

810
01:04:00,169 --> 01:04:03,713
What a night for US pairs skating.
It's extraordinary.

811
01:04:04,715 --> 01:04:07,467
Brian Neuman and Lorie Pekurovsky
into first place.

812
01:04:07,593 --> 01:04:10,428
Johnny and Jodie Weiderman skate
safely into the number two spot.

813
01:04:10,596 --> 01:04:14,474
And out of nowhere, Kate Moseley
and Doug Dorsey grab the number three.

814
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:16,601
(woman) Two couples
are all the United States

815
01:04:16,769 --> 01:04:18,937
are allowed to send
to the Olympic Games.

816
01:04:19,063 --> 01:04:22,524
Tomorrow night's long program
should be very exciting.

817
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:26,862
Man, this overnight thing is brutal.
Why can't it be a double-header?

818
01:04:26,988 --> 01:04:29,948
Short program, long program, same night.
Boom.

819
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:32,784
- We're out of here. Know what I mean?
- I know what you mean.

820
01:04:32,952 --> 01:04:37,122
It's like, enough already. It's like...
What's the word?

821
01:04:37,623 --> 01:04:41,501
- You know what word I'm looking for?
- I don't know. Expectation?

822
01:04:41,627 --> 01:04:43,753
- No, no. When you, uh...
- Anticipation?

823
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:46,006
- Excitement?
- Foreplay.

824
01:04:47,341 --> 01:04:49,843
- Foreplay?
- Yeah, you know. Like foreplay.

825
01:04:49,969 --> 01:04:51,636
Yeah, I know what it means.

826
01:04:51,804 --> 01:04:54,139
Well, wouldn't you rather
just get right to it?

827
01:04:54,265 --> 01:04:57,809
- What?
- Skating. Long program.

828
01:04:59,312 --> 01:05:01,229
Chicago. Nationals.

829
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:03,565
Flowers?

830
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:10,113
Sleep. I'd rather sleep.

831
01:05:13,784 --> 01:05:15,952
- (door shuts)
- Sleep?

832
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:29,466
(woman) Brian Neuman
and Lorie Pekurovsky.

833
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:33,345
Beautiful skating. This assures them
a place on the Olympic team.

834
01:05:33,512 --> 01:05:37,015
(man) The remaining spot will go to
one of the two teams left to skate:

835
01:05:37,141 --> 01:05:39,809
Moseley-Dorsey or the Weidermans.

836
01:05:45,149 --> 01:05:47,192
(woman) Kate Moseley and Doug Dorsey.

837
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:50,695
What a performance.
Look at that sit spin.

838
01:05:50,821 --> 01:05:54,032
This crowd knows it's seeing
history in the making.

839
01:05:54,158 --> 01:05:56,618
We're in for a major upset tonight.

840
01:05:59,830 --> 01:06:03,458
(applause)

841
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:18,640
(woman) Oh, yes. That was great skating.

842
01:06:18,766 --> 01:06:21,017
(man) Clean, powerful,
and the crowd just loved it.

843
01:06:21,143 --> 01:06:23,895
- Fantastic.
- Are those for me?

844
01:06:24,021 --> 01:06:25,563
Hey. You were great.

- (announcer) 5.4, 5.4, 5.4...
- (man) These are not great marks.

846
01:06:31,779 --> 01:06:34,614
- I expected much higher.
- (woman) Evidently, so did the crowd.

847
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:37,367
- (booing)
- It's hard to explain,

848
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:40,829
sometimes scores reflect
more than what's on the ice.

849
01:06:40,955 --> 01:06:45,959
The judges have their favorites. And
they don't include Moseley and Dorsey.

850
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:50,380
The Weidermans will join Neuman
and Pekurovsky on the Olympic team.

851
01:06:50,506 --> 01:06:53,049
(announce continues)

852
01:06:53,175 --> 01:06:54,759
This is horseshit!

853
01:06:54,927 --> 01:06:58,930
What crap are they trying to pull?
We skated our asses off out there!

854
01:06:59,056 --> 01:07:01,725
You call this a sport? Bullshit.

855
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,941
(cheering)

856
01:07:10,109 --> 01:07:12,235

(crowd groans)

858
01:07:48,272 --> 01:07:52,317
(woman) Just terrible. She stepped
into the spin, then, I'm not sure,

859
01:07:52,443 --> 01:07:56,071
but it looked like she got caught
in his lederhosen.

860
01:07:56,197 --> 01:07:58,114
(man) You know what this means.

861
01:08:01,202 --> 01:08:02,952
We are in.

862
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:07,665
Yeah! Yeah! We're going to France!

863
01:08:07,792 --> 01:08:09,542
Parlez-vous Olympics?

(? The Dan Reed Network "Baby Now l")

865
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:15,215
- Sure you wanna do this?
- Whatever you're having.

866
01:10:02,907 --> 01:10:05,867
- All right. We're here.
- (Kate laughing)

867
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:09,287
(Kate) Oh, boy.

868
01:10:10,956 --> 01:10:13,333
- (Kate laughs)
- OK.

869
01:10:15,127 --> 01:10:17,253
Whoo! Whoa. (laughs)

870
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:22,467
You wanna dance?

871
01:10:22,593 --> 01:10:26,471
- No, I don't think so.
- Aw, Doug. (laughs)

872
01:10:27,014 --> 01:10:28,765
Douglas, you silly thing.

873
01:10:28,891 --> 01:10:31,768
Please don't think. (chuckles)

874
01:10:32,978 --> 01:10:36,648
That's what I like about the way I feel.
Even if I tried to think, I couldn't.

875
01:10:36,815 --> 01:10:40,318
And I think too much,
and I think so long. And it's so tiring.

876
01:10:41,278 --> 01:10:44,155
The world is spinning
and spinning and spinning.

877
01:10:46,867 --> 01:10:48,201
(Doug) Look.

878
01:10:51,705 --> 01:10:53,456
Did you ever play with magnets?

879
01:10:53,582 --> 01:10:56,542
You used to have to push them around
and they'd push away

880
01:10:56,669 --> 01:10:59,712
and you push them around the table?
All you really had to do

881
01:10:59,838 --> 01:11:03,424
was just flip them over, and suddenly...

882
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:13,977
Don't you see? That's why
everything's been so awful.

883
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:16,521
All we needed was a little flip.

884
01:11:16,647 --> 01:11:18,273
Kate, it's not right. What about Hale?

885
01:11:18,399 --> 01:11:22,360
(Kate) Oh, Hale-shmale. (laughs)

886
01:11:22,486 --> 01:11:23,486
We're through.

887
01:11:26,615 --> 01:11:29,284
Our engagement is off.

888
01:11:30,035 --> 01:11:32,787
Flip. (laughs)

889
01:11:53,767 --> 01:11:56,769
Come on. Not tonight. Not like this.

890
01:11:56,895 --> 01:11:58,730
Not like what?

891
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:04,569
Not like me? (laughs)

892
01:12:04,695 --> 01:12:07,989
- Kate, you're bombed.
- What do you mean? (giggles)

893
01:12:08,907 --> 01:12:12,035
That means that it's time
for you to go to bed.

894
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:14,871
God, just what I need.
Someone else telling me what to do.

895
01:12:15,956 --> 01:12:19,625
In case you've missed it,
I am throwing myself at you.

896
01:12:19,752 --> 01:12:21,586
I am tearing off my clothes

897
01:12:21,712 --> 01:12:25,006
and you are giving me a rundown
on drinking dos and don'ts.

898
01:12:25,132 --> 01:12:27,633
- Hey. Why don't you calm...
- I get enough coaching on the ice.

899
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:29,594
- Get out.
- You've got this all wrong.

900
01:12:29,762 --> 01:12:31,304
Do I ever.

901
01:12:33,390 --> 01:12:36,934
Excuse my surprise, but really,
what a disappointment.

902
01:12:37,936 --> 01:12:40,605
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Well, look at you.

903
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:44,609
God's gift to reckless abandon

904
01:12:44,735 --> 01:12:47,695
revealed as nothing but a prude
in wolf's clothing.

905
01:12:50,282 --> 01:12:52,575
You're a lousy drunk.

906
01:12:52,701 --> 01:12:54,577
And you're a lousy date!

907
01:12:59,333 --> 01:13:01,000
It didn't have to be like this.

908
01:13:02,878 --> 01:13:04,295
I said get out.

909
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:11,386

911

(knocking on door)

912
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:50,800
Hi.

913
01:13:52,010 --> 01:13:53,719
I watched your program.

914
01:13:53,846 --> 01:13:56,556
You've got a great sit spin.

915
01:13:59,143 --> 01:14:02,520
I thought maybe we could trade secrets.

916
01:14:38,891 --> 01:14:39,891
(sighs)

917
01:14:56,825 --> 01:14:58,951
It's a little early for practice,
isn't it?

918
01:14:59,077 --> 01:15:01,412
I'm sorry. I must have
the wrong room.

919
01:15:01,538 --> 01:15:03,623
(Doug) Ask her for more towels,
will you?

920
01:15:16,094 --> 01:15:17,261
Kate.

921
01:15:18,222 --> 01:15:19,931
Kate!

922
01:15:20,098 --> 01:15:22,099
Kate, will you wait a minute? Kate.

923
01:15:22,226 --> 01:15:24,852
Kate. Kate!

924
01:15:25,687 --> 01:15:27,480
- Kate.
- Don't. Don't even try it.

925
01:15:27,606 --> 01:15:28,981
Looking at you makes me sick.

926
01:15:29,107 --> 01:15:33,069
To think I was coming to apologize.
Lorie Pekurovsky.

927
01:15:33,195 --> 01:15:35,488
Were you or were you not engaged
until last night?

928
01:15:35,614 --> 01:15:37,990
- Hardly the point.
- You threw me out of your room.

929
01:15:38,116 --> 01:15:39,951
Count your blessings,
she may not have waited.

930
01:15:40,077 --> 01:15:42,662
- That's not how it happened.
- Spare me the details.

931
01:15:42,788 --> 01:15:45,081
- Where the hell do you get off?
- Me?

932
01:15:45,207 --> 01:15:48,793
This is my fault? From the first day,
you treated me like a hired hand.

933
01:15:48,961 --> 01:15:53,089
Then one night you get drunk,
I'm supposed to thank my lucky stars?

934
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:55,466
I'm sorry. I don't downshift that fast.

935
01:15:55,592 --> 01:15:57,802
- Get out of my way.
- No problem.

936
01:15:58,929 --> 01:16:01,639
I've been practicing that move
for a year and a half!

937
01:16:04,434 --> 01:16:06,310
(chuckles)

938
01:16:07,938 --> 01:16:09,146
Blind date.

939
01:16:11,233 --> 01:16:12,233
So we have little problem, huh?

940
01:16:14,528 --> 01:16:17,321
Good. We skip little problem,

941
01:16:17,489 --> 01:16:20,575
and go straight line to big problem.

942
01:16:22,494 --> 01:16:25,788
"And what is big problem, coach?"

943
01:16:26,999 --> 01:16:29,292
Smilkov and Brushkin.

944
01:16:30,586 --> 01:16:32,003
"Who?"

945
01:16:32,129 --> 01:16:35,464
Smilkov and Brushkin.

946
01:16:36,383 --> 01:16:38,843
Last night they win
European Championship.

947
01:16:39,678 --> 01:16:42,013
Perfect scores.

948

Everybody's been blown away.
Contest is over.

949
01:16:46,518 --> 01:16:50,479
Smilkov and Brushkin are unbeatable.

950
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:54,859
So, hello, Soviet surprise package.

951
01:16:54,985 --> 01:16:57,028
Goodbye, gold medal.

952
01:16:58,864 --> 01:17:03,034
Of course, there is a possible solution.

953
01:17:03,201 --> 01:17:07,538
But... it's probably too dangerous.

954
01:17:20,510 --> 01:17:21,761
Where did these come from?

955
01:17:21,887 --> 01:17:23,679
For 20 years,
I've been working on this.

956
01:17:23,805 --> 01:17:27,224
But you know, to have skaters,
to have situation,

957
01:17:27,351 --> 01:17:31,270
to have desire, is not ready until now.

958
01:17:31,396 --> 01:17:34,398
What is this?
Is this a bounce spin into a throw?

959
01:17:34,524 --> 01:17:36,233
(Pamchenko) Mm-hm.

960
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:39,070
- You can't do that.
- The key to this is release.

961
01:17:39,237 --> 01:17:43,282
- There can be no halfway.
- No. No. It's illegal.

962
01:17:43,408 --> 01:17:47,578
(laughs, speaks Russian)
Is gray area.

963
01:17:48,413 --> 01:17:52,208
Bounce spin to a throw twist.
Then I catch her?

964
01:17:52,334 --> 01:17:54,043
Well, sort of.

965
01:17:55,253 --> 01:17:56,295
We can't do this.

966
01:17:56,421 --> 01:17:58,756
Why not? We have all the pieces.

967
01:17:58,882 --> 01:18:01,008
We have five weeks.

968
01:18:01,426 --> 01:18:04,053
The Pamchenko Twist.

969
01:18:04,179 --> 01:18:07,098
- Absolutely not.
- You expect us to name it after you?

970
01:18:07,224 --> 01:18:08,974
No, no. Is mistake.

971
01:18:09,101 --> 01:18:12,228
- Is not right time.
- This is good stuff. I can do this.

972
01:18:12,354 --> 01:18:14,605
- What are you saying? I can't?
- Hey, if the shoe fits.

973
01:18:14,731 --> 01:18:17,608
Hey, listen. I have been
competing for 13 years

974
01:18:17,776 --> 01:18:21,362
and nobody tells me
what I can or cannot do.

975
01:18:26,827 --> 01:18:28,536
Don't quit your day job.

976
01:18:34,376 --> 01:18:35,918
OK, again.

977
01:18:36,044 --> 01:18:37,461
Again.

978
01:18:38,463 --> 01:18:41,006
Again, again. Again. Again.

979
01:18:44,928 --> 01:18:46,011
Katya, head up.

980
01:18:47,305 --> 01:18:50,808
Higher. Higher. She has to fly.

981
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:59,275
- Are they gonna get it?
- Eventually.

982
01:19:00,569 --> 01:19:02,027
Before they kill each other?

983
01:19:06,324 --> 01:19:10,453
Release. Release must be total.
Is no halfway. Halfway is bullshit.

984
01:19:10,579 --> 01:19:13,080
You go halfway, you get hurt.

985
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:26,051
Higher. Much higher.

986
01:19:27,471 --> 01:19:30,222
We are needing an explosion.

987
01:19:33,268 --> 01:19:35,352
(Kate) Oh! Oh!

988
01:20:07,385 --> 01:20:08,511
Kate?

989
01:20:10,013 --> 01:20:12,681
I was just looking at
the pictures of Mother.

990
01:20:19,147 --> 01:20:20,731
(Jack) I can hear her now:

991
01:20:20,857 --> 01:20:22,066
"The Olympics."

992
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:26,904
It's what she always dreamed of.

993
01:20:29,574 --> 01:20:32,701
Look at this thing.
Just sitting here empty.

994
01:20:35,997 --> 01:20:37,581
We're almost there, honey.

995
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:42,086
- I can taste it.
- What if it stays empty?

996
01:20:42,212 --> 01:20:46,215
Mm. Not this time. Go to bed.
You need your rest.

997
01:20:46,341 --> 01:20:47,883
I'm not tired.

998
01:20:48,009 --> 01:20:51,220
- Kate.
- No. What are we doing?

999
01:20:54,683 --> 01:20:56,392
Why am I doing this?

1000
01:20:58,562 --> 01:21:00,271
It's what you've always wanted.

1001
01:21:01,439 --> 01:21:02,773
Always?

1002
01:21:06,611 --> 01:21:08,279
- Kate...
- I know.

1003
01:21:09,823 --> 01:21:13,951
I'm going. These little pep talks
can be so exhausting.

1004
01:21:20,584 --> 01:21:23,252
(classical music plays on TV)

1005
01:21:29,217 --> 01:21:31,302
(music plays backwards)

1006
01:22:02,417 --> 01:22:04,543
(woman) Opening ceremonies,
you enjoyed yourself?

1007
01:22:04,669 --> 01:22:06,921
- (Brian) It was great.
- Cold and great.

1008
01:22:07,047 --> 01:22:10,090
So, Doug, what's the difference
between this and hockey?

1009
01:22:11,009 --> 01:22:13,177
- The women.
- (laughter)

1010
01:22:13,303 --> 01:22:15,262
What's the feeling?
Everybody out for themselves

1011
01:22:15,388 --> 01:22:17,848
or is there a team spirit building?

1012
01:22:18,850 --> 01:22:21,518
- Oh, we're definitely a team.
- Definitely.

1013
01:22:22,354 --> 01:22:24,063
There's a real sense of togetherness.

1014
01:22:24,189 --> 01:22:26,732
- Spirit.
- Spirit.

1015
01:22:26,858 --> 01:22:29,735
Family. It's sort of...

1016
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:32,154
It's almost...

1017
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:34,198
- It's almost...
- Orgasmic.

1018
01:22:35,116 --> 01:22:36,450
(woman) What did she say?

1019
01:22:37,661 --> 01:22:40,204
- The Russians.
- The Russians.

1020
01:22:40,330 --> 01:22:41,330
(man) Nikolai?

1021
01:22:42,457 --> 01:22:44,041
- (man) Nikolai?
- (woman) Can we get a photo?

1022
01:22:44,209 --> 01:22:45,542
You guys gonna be here a while?

1023
01:22:45,710 --> 01:22:49,380
(classical music plays)

1024
01:22:59,933 --> 01:23:02,601
(applause)

1025
01:23:11,319 --> 01:23:12,820
You forgot a button.

1026
01:23:12,946 --> 01:23:14,446
No, I like it open.

1027
01:23:16,533 --> 01:23:18,242
Well, it looks terrible.

1028
01:23:18,410 --> 01:23:19,994
It pulls at my neck.

1029
01:23:22,956 --> 01:23:24,540
You should've
mentioned that in Chicago.

1030
01:23:24,666 --> 01:23:27,084
(speaks Russian) Enough.

1031
01:23:29,671 --> 01:23:32,297
(announcer speaking French)

1032
01:23:32,424 --> 01:23:34,508
(speaking French)

1033
01:23:35,093 --> 01:23:36,343
Button it.

1034
01:23:37,262 --> 01:23:41,432
- We're on.
- (speaks Russian) Good luck.

1035
01:23:46,771 --> 01:23:50,607
(woman) Representing the United States
of America, Moseley and Dorsey.

1036
01:23:50,734 --> 01:23:53,527
- Button the goddamn button.
- Get over it.

1037
01:23:53,653 --> 01:23:56,155
You are an immature asshole
of the lowest order.

1038
01:23:56,281 --> 01:23:57,614
(? Yello "The Race")

1039
01:23:57,782 --> 01:24:00,451
If it was 40 below and that button
meant the difference

1040
01:24:00,618 --> 01:24:04,621
between a long satisfying life
and a horrible death from hypothermia,

1041
01:24:04,748 --> 01:24:07,291
I still wouldn't give you
the satisfaction.

1042
01:24:08,084 --> 01:24:09,293
Skate.

1043
01:24:34,778 --> 01:24:36,153
(man) A technically superior program,

1044
01:24:36,321 --> 01:24:38,614
but did you feel there
was something missing?

1045
01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:41,909
(woman) Absolutely. They delivered all
the short program required moves,

1046
01:24:42,035 --> 01:24:43,494
but it seemed very cold.

1047
01:24:43,661 --> 01:24:46,622
(man) As if we were seeing two
strangers, rather than a fluid pair.

1048
01:24:47,791 --> 01:24:49,792
It just didn't look like
they were having fun out there.

1049
01:24:53,588 --> 01:24:55,130
(woman) Hey, Doug.

1050
01:24:55,256 --> 01:24:58,008
- Was the altitude a problem tonight?
- No.

1051
01:25:00,345 --> 01:25:04,640
Long program. We've been hearing all
week about your new surprise move.

1052
01:25:04,766 --> 01:25:06,558
- What's it called?
- The Pamchenko.

1053
01:25:06,684 --> 01:25:09,853
- The Pamchenko. Is it named after?
- We're not doing it.

1054
01:25:09,979 --> 01:25:12,147
- What?
- We've taken it out of the program.

1055
01:25:12,273 --> 01:25:15,526
- It's not ready.
- Doug?

1056
01:25:18,488 --> 01:25:19,905
(Pamchenko) A button?

1057
01:25:20,031 --> 01:25:22,574
- What in hell are you thinking of?
- Me?

1058
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:24,535
Yes, you. What the hell
is in your head?

1059
01:25:24,702 --> 01:25:27,579
- He's making like this is my fault.
- You didn't deliver.

1060
01:25:27,705 --> 01:25:29,081
What, you want a pat on the back?

1061
01:25:29,207 --> 01:25:30,749
When did I become
the designated asshole?

1062
01:25:30,875 --> 01:25:32,376
What happened? Ask the ice queen.

1063
01:25:32,502 --> 01:25:35,754
- That'll be enough of that.
- Let me know when you're done, Jack,

1064
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:39,883
you can tell me why I spent five weeks
on a move she was never gonna do.

1065
01:25:40,009 --> 01:25:42,219
- You're out of line.
- I needed the gold medal!

1066
01:25:42,345 --> 01:25:44,596
Forget it!
We can win without the move.

1067
01:25:44,722 --> 01:25:48,016
- (Pamchenko) lmpossible.
- Where were you when this was going on?

1068
01:25:48,143 --> 01:25:50,060
(Pamchenko) Where was I?
I was babysitting!

1069
01:25:50,186 --> 01:25:53,063
Loud and clear, folks:
Losing gracefully does nothing for me!

1070
01:25:53,189 --> 01:25:56,400
- Think about that in the future!
- That what you told Brian in Calgary?

1071
01:25:59,863 --> 01:26:02,614
You can kid all you want about
what happened. I've seen the tapes.

1072
01:26:02,740 --> 01:26:06,368
Brian was getting it done.
Ask him. He'll tell you.

1073
01:26:07,954 --> 01:26:09,580
All right, Douglas, is enough.

1074
01:26:09,747 --> 01:26:12,875
Today, it's about a button.
You people are all excuses.

1075
01:26:13,001 --> 01:26:15,085
- You wanna point a finger...
- You goddamn son of a bitch.

1076
01:26:15,211 --> 01:26:17,045
Gotta find that go-to guy.

1077
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:19,423
You should've started
with a go-to girl, Jack.

1078
01:26:19,549 --> 01:26:20,632
- That cuts it!
- He's right.

1079
01:26:20,758 --> 01:26:22,259
What?

1080
01:26:22,886 --> 01:26:24,219
He's right. He is.

1081
01:26:27,932 --> 01:26:29,224
All of it.

1082
01:26:30,768 --> 01:26:32,853
We worked so hard for two years.

1083
01:26:33,897 --> 01:26:35,689
And I just went and threw it all away.

1084
01:26:44,657 --> 01:26:46,992
- Why did you stay with me?
- Kate, don't.

1085
01:26:48,912 --> 01:26:52,456
Don't what? Tell the truth?

1086
01:26:55,251 --> 01:26:56,960
We can't buy back what happened today.

1087
01:26:58,755 --> 01:27:00,297
(Kate) We can't start over.

1088
01:27:02,133 --> 01:27:04,718
Do you think I look at myself,
at what I've become,

1089
01:27:04,844 --> 01:27:06,511
and do you think I'm proud?

1090
01:27:07,972 --> 01:27:12,142
- What do you want?
- I don't know.

1091
01:27:15,146 --> 01:27:17,022
I guess I would like
to go back to the beginning

1092
01:27:17,148 --> 01:27:21,360
and have you say, win or lose,
I could just be your daughter.

1093
01:27:27,033 --> 01:27:28,951
You came every day, and you skated.

1094
01:27:31,287 --> 01:27:33,747
This must've been
like a nightmare for you.

1095
01:27:39,837 --> 01:27:42,839
I didn't know it was
gonna end up like this.

1096
01:27:49,931 --> 01:27:51,306
I'm sorry.

1097
01:27:56,938 --> 01:27:59,356
I'm so sorry. For everything.

1098
01:28:04,570 --> 01:28:06,238
Please excuse me.

1099
01:28:17,959 --> 01:28:19,376
I'm going for a walk.

1100
01:29:39,123 --> 01:29:41,166
(maid speaks French)

1101
01:29:43,086 --> 01:29:45,962
Kate. What's this?

1102
01:29:48,591 --> 01:29:52,552
I'm going over with my father.
Anton has the other car.

1103
01:29:52,678 --> 01:29:54,304
He'll take you when you're ready to go.

1104
01:29:54,430 --> 01:29:58,141
- No, I'm talking about the bags.
- I was gonna catch the 6:30 flight.

1105
01:29:58,309 --> 01:30:00,977
Tonight? After we skate?

1106
01:30:01,145 --> 01:30:04,815
The house is paid up for two weeks, so
feel free to stay as long as you like.

1107
01:30:04,982 --> 01:30:07,567
Kate, wait. What are you saying?
If this is about yesterday...

1108
01:30:07,693 --> 01:30:08,985
I'm retiring.

1109
01:30:11,906 --> 01:30:12,989
What?

1110
01:30:16,494 --> 01:30:19,121
This afternoon is my final skate.

1111
01:30:20,498 --> 01:30:22,541
- Kate, come on...
- You'll be fine.

1112
01:30:24,502 --> 01:30:27,003
You won't have any trouble
finding another partner.

1113
01:30:30,508 --> 01:30:34,469
Of course, they won't have
my wonderful slap shot. (laughs)

1114
01:30:37,098 --> 01:30:38,640
I gotta go get ready.

1115
01:30:49,527 --> 01:30:52,112
(instrumental music plays)

1116
01:31:23,478 --> 01:31:26,062
(orchestral music plays)

1117
01:31:30,485 --> 01:31:33,236
(woman) Beautiful extension.
Very classy.

1118
01:31:33,362 --> 01:31:34,863
(man) Executed very nicely.

1119
01:31:34,989 --> 01:31:37,073
I hope they can keep it
going to the finish.

1120
01:31:50,463 --> 01:31:53,924
(woman) Neuman and Pekurovsky
looking well-positioned for a medal.

1121
01:31:54,091 --> 01:31:57,469
Still to skate are Smilkov-Brushkin
and Kate Moseley and Doug Dorsey.

1122
01:31:57,595 --> 01:32:01,473
- (Russian music plays)
- (audience clapping)

1123
01:32:10,650 --> 01:32:12,776
Do you know what I think
would be wonderful?

1124
01:32:14,278 --> 01:32:18,073
If you would go out there today
and skate for these people...

1125
01:32:19,367 --> 01:32:21,117
...the way I have seen you skate.

1126
01:32:25,498 --> 01:32:27,332
Enjoy each other.

1127
01:32:29,669 --> 01:32:32,045
(speaking Russian)

1128
01:32:38,719 --> 01:32:41,304
(applause)

1129
01:32:44,392 --> 01:32:46,851
(cheering)

1130
01:32:52,858 --> 01:32:54,818
(Kate) What's the matter?

1131
01:32:55,611 --> 01:32:57,779
- Nothing.
- Are you all right?

1132
01:32:57,905 --> 01:32:59,239
Fine.

1133
01:33:02,660 --> 01:33:06,705
- (music ends)
- (applause, cheering)

1134
01:33:10,918 --> 01:33:14,462
Kate, I'm sorry. My timing,
I know it stinks, but...

1135
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:19,301
I just keep thinking this thing
with us... it's gonna go away.

1136
01:33:19,427 --> 01:33:22,929
I keep thinking if I can just
keep moving and checking,

1137
01:33:23,055 --> 01:33:24,973
I'll get clear, but...

1138
01:33:25,766 --> 01:33:27,684
Do you understand what I'm telling you?

1139
01:33:27,810 --> 01:33:31,521
- I don't wanna fight anymore.
- No. I mean, yeah, I don't wanna fight.

1140
01:33:31,647 --> 01:33:33,690
- Look, we have to skate.
- This won't wait.

1141
01:33:33,858 --> 01:33:36,192
Kate, maybe I wasn't ready. Maybe...

1142
01:33:36,319 --> 01:33:38,945
Maybe you didn't give me much
of a chance. Maybe...

1143
01:33:39,071 --> 01:33:41,906
I don't know. I just... I just...

1144
01:33:42,033 --> 01:33:43,825
(announcer) Nine-six. Nine-three.

1145
01:33:43,951 --> 01:33:46,828
(woman speaking French)

1146
01:33:46,954 --> 01:33:49,289
Kate, somewhere in the middle
of all this, I fell in love with you.

1147
01:33:50,583 --> 01:33:53,918
- (woman speaking French)
- You may take the ice.

1148
01:33:55,296 --> 01:33:58,923
I'm saying I love you.
I'm saying it out loud.

1149
01:33:59,050 --> 01:34:02,093
(announcer speaking French)

1150
01:34:07,683 --> 01:34:09,893
(woman speaking French)

1151
01:34:11,687 --> 01:34:15,357
Don't say we're not right for each
other. We may not be right for anybody.

1152
01:34:15,983 --> 01:34:18,485
- (woman) You have to go on.
- Will you shut up a minute!

1153
01:34:19,862 --> 01:34:23,031
It can't be any harder to stay together
than it was to stay apart.

1154
01:34:23,157 --> 01:34:25,158
- (woman) Thirty seconds.
- (Doug) Will you wait a minute?!

1155
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:30,330
Kate... I need you.

1156
01:34:33,959 --> 01:34:35,126
I need you.

1157
01:34:47,598 --> 01:34:49,265
We're doing the Pamchenko.

1158
01:34:49,392 --> 01:34:52,394
- What?
- Oh, you heard me.

1159
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:54,771
Think I'm doing this
to get a program out of you?

1160
01:34:54,939 --> 01:34:56,439
You wanna win, don't you?

1161
01:34:57,358 --> 01:35:00,235
No. It's no good, Kate.
It's too dangerous.

1162
01:35:00,361 --> 01:35:02,737
Then we agreed. We're putting it in.

1163
01:35:02,863 --> 01:35:07,325
- (woman speaking French)
- (applause)

1164
01:35:07,451 --> 01:35:08,952
- It's out.
- It's in.

1165
01:35:09,078 --> 01:35:11,454
- Out.
- In.

1166
01:35:14,083 --> 01:35:16,584
- What difference does it make?
- The difference is...

1167
01:35:16,711 --> 01:35:18,461
...l'm in the mood
to kick a little ass.

1168
01:35:18,629 --> 01:35:23,007

(cheering, applause)

1171
01:37:04,318 --> 01:37:07,237
- You didn't have to.
- Yes, I did.

1172
01:37:08,155 --> 01:37:09,739
Why?

1173
01:37:11,575 --> 01:37:12,992
Because I love you.

1174
01:37:15,955 --> 01:37:17,747
Just remember who said it first.

1175
01:37:20,459 --> 01:37:23,419
