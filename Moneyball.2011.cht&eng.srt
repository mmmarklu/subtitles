Kid needs at bats. Give him 400 at bats, he's gonna get better.

Okay. People who run ball clubs, they think in terms of buying players.

295
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:58,486
你的目的不是Iu球T 而是I取倮
Your goal shouldn't be to buy players. Your goal should be to buy wins.

要I到倮 就要I得分
And in order to buy wins, you need to buy runs.

你想找人代替尼.戴蒙
You're trying to replace Johnny Damon.

是看到一r值750f美元一年的明星
and they see a star who's worth $7.5 million a year.

而我看尼.戴蒙
When I see Johnny Damon,

He's a decent leadoff hitter. He can steal bases.

但他值波士Dtmo的 每年750f的薪金
But is he worth the $ 7.5 million a year that the Boston Red Sox are paying him?

306
00:20:31,128 --> 00:20:32,959

No. No.

And if I say it to anybody, I'm ostracized. I'm a leper.

所以我才跟你@圈子
So that's why I'm cagey about this with you.

We need to score at least 814 runs in order to win those games

00:27:17,167 --> 00:27:18,429
@是什N
What's this?

400
00:27:18,635 --> 00:27:22,196
是我做的年度球Tu估t
This is a code that I'Ve written for our year-to-year projections.

401
00:27:22,406 --> 00:27:26,001
是根我掌握的所有 YηTM行u估
This is building in the intelligence that we haVe to project players.

402
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:27,199
然後呢
Okay.

403
00:27:27,411 --> 00:27:30,005
就是⒏鞣N信息底只
It's about getting things down to one number.

404
00:27:30,514 --> 00:27:33,039
通^我特有的分析
Using the stats the way we read them,

就lFe人看不到的 球T的在r值
we'll find Value in players that nobody else can see.

406

有的人才因
People are oVerlooked

407
00:27:41,391 --> 00:27:45,157
各N偏和外在的缺c被忽
for a Variety of biased reasons and perceiVed flaws.

408
00:27:45,362 --> 00:27:48,627
比如年g 外貌 性格
Age, appearance, personality.

409

我相信就有我付得起的25
I believe that there is a championship team

412

可以M建一支Z冠的球T
of 25 people that we can afford,

413
00:28:04,681 --> 00:28:07,809
因槠渌I热耸慷嫉凸懒怂
because everyone else in baseball undervalues them.

414
00:28:08,018 --> 00:28:11,249
他就像被孤立的不匹配玩具
Like an island of misfit toys.

比利 @是查德.布拉德福 他是後援投手
Billy, this is chad Bradford. He's a relief pitcher.

他就是最被低估的球T之一
He is one of the most undervalued players in baseball.

417
00:28:23,567 --> 00:28:26,502
他的缺c是投球幼骱芑稽
His defect is that he throws funny.

418
00:28:27,371 --> 00:28:31,398
就因樗幼骰稽 棒球大盟]人看重他
Nobody in the big leagues cares about him because he looks funny.

but one of the most effectiVe relief pitchers in all baseball.

421

@人值得年薪300f美金
This guy should cost $3 million a year.

I can't manage this team under a one-year contract.

437

00:30:21,852 --> 00:30:24,377
好吧 我要拉一去比
Okay. I gotta put a team on the field.

440

After that, I'll take a good long look at your contract.

Deal with the manager's contract, then put a team on the field.

At this moment, if a grounder's hit to first, nobody's there to stop it.

在只一年合s的毫ο 治疫@份活可不容易
It's not easy doing what I do under the cloud of a one-year contract.

A one-year contract means the same thing to a manager as to a player.

我]有信心
There's not a lot of faith there.

448

上季A了102 有@拥慕Y果真是奇怪
Which is strange after a 102-win season.

449
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:57,853
明白了
I see.

450

If you lose the last game of the season, nobody gives a shit.

I told you we can't do it, and we can't do it.

462
00:32:09,893 --> 00:32:14,057
F在我能做的是再造一他
Now, what we might be able to do is re-create him.

463

而且我知道他在錾系娜觞c

他都_始l福了
He's getting thick around the waist.

His on-base percentage is all we're looking at now.

And Jeremy gets on base an awful lot for a guy who only costs 285,000.

Steinbrenner's so pissed at his decline, he's willing to eat his contract to get rid of him.

but in the dog days in July, August, we're lucky if he's gonna hit his weight.

We'll be lucky to get 60 games out of him. Why do you like him?

No one wants to pick him up. Good. He's cheap.

被半蛋羟蚵盟球放的人
that's been released by half the organizations in baseball

515
00:34:54,157 --> 00:34:58,287
因樗的肘部受^不可治K的 神pе滤不能扔球
because he's got nonrepairable nerve damage in his elbow and can't throw.

516
00:34:58,495 --> 00:35:01,828
他不能扔球又不能接防 他能致锬
He can't throw and he can't field. But what can he do?

So he walks a lot. He gets on base a lot, Rocco.

521
00:35:11,241 --> 00:35:13,835
我需要在乎是保送是安打
Do I care if it's a walk or a hit?

522
00:35:14,044 --> 00:35:15,375

He answers to no one except ownership and God.

他]必要ξ有交待
And he doesn't have to answer to us.

我提建h 他碜Q定
We make suggestions, he makes decisions.

537

@三人都不知道怎N守一
None of those three guys knows how to play first base.

He only throws the ball about 82, 83 miles an hour. There must be something...

01:56:10,433 --> 01:56:14,927
因槲蚁嘈趴W可以破解比斯的魔咒 (1920年tm比斯被u後{咒 tmo法再得全冠)

You know, why someone took so long to hire that guy is beyond me.

One of the great things about money is that it buys a lot of things,

For 41 million, you built a play-off team.

You won the exact same number of games that the Yankees won,

but the Yankees spent 1.4 million per win,

1696
