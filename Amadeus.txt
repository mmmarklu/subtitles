早安!神父
Good morning, Father.
Herr Salieri?
Leave me alone.
別吵我
I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.
我不能丟下孤獨的老人
Do you know who I am?
你知道我是誰嗎?
這有何差別?
That makes no difference.
在上帝的眼中，眾生都是平等的
All men are equal in God's eyes.
是嗎?
Are they?
Offer me your confession.
向我懺悔吧!
我能請求上帝寬恕你
I can offer you God's forgiveness.
How well are you trained in music?
你練習音樂多久了?
I know a little.
I studied it in my youth.
我懂一些皮毛，我年輕的時候學過
在那裡學的
-Where?
-Here in Vienna.
在維也納
Then you must know this.
那你一定聽過這首
我好像沒有聽過
I can't say that I do.
那是什麼?
What is it?
是當時很受歡迎的曲子，我寫的
It was a very popular tune in its day.
I wrote it.
Here, how about this?
This one brought down the house
when we played it.
這是我最欣賞的曲子
如何?
Well?
對不起，這首也不是很熟悉
I regret it is not too familiar.
你沒聽過我任何一首曲子嗎?
Can you recall no melody of mine?
我本來是全歐洲最著名的大作曲家
I was the most famous composer
in Europe.
我一個人寫了四十首歌劇
I wrote 40 operas alone.
Here!
這一首如何?
What about this one?
我聽過那首，那真迷人
Yes, I know that!
That's charming !
對不起，我不知道這是你寫的
I' m sorry, I didn't know
you wrote that.
這首不是我寫的
I didn't.
那是莫札特所作的
沃夫岡．阿瑪迪斯．莫札特
That was Mozart.
Wolfgang . . .
. . .Amadeus Mozart.
就是你責怪自己謀殺的人?
The man you accuse yourself
of killing .
你聽說了嗎?
You've heard that?
是真的嗎?
Is it true?
看在上帝的面子上，我的子民
For God's sake, my son. . .
如果你想懺悔...
. . .if you have something to confess,
do it now.
就說出來吧!
Give yourself some peace.
如此才會心境平和
He. . .
他，是我的偶像
. . .was my idol.
莫札特，我可以想到當時
Mozart.
I can 't think of a time
when I didn't know his name.
他的名字隨時隨地在我心中響起
I was playing games. . .
我仍在玩遊戲的時候
. . . when he was playing music
for kings and emperors.
他已在國王面前演奏，包括帝王
Even the pope in Rome.
甚至在羅馬教宗之前
I admit, I was jealous. . .
當我聽到有關他的事蹟時
. . . when I heard the tales
they told about him.
我承認我心中非常嫉妒
Not of the brilliant little prodigy. . .
他有著很好的家世
. . .but of his father,
who had taught him everything.
他父親甚至教他一切
我父親，他甚至不關心音樂
My father, he did not care for music.
當我告訴他
When I told him. . .
. . . how I wished I could be
like Mozart. . .
我多麼渴望成為像莫札特那樣
. . .he would say, ''Why? Do you want
to be a trained monkey?
他說了!
喂!你為什麼想當隻訓練過的猴子
You 'd like me to drag you around,
doing tricks like a circus freak?''
讓我帶你到全歐洲玩把戲?
像馬戲團表演那樣?
How could I tell him. . .
我怎樣才能讓他知道
音樂在我心中的地位
. . .what music meant to me?
While my father
prayed earnestly to God. . .
當我父親熱切祈禱上帝
. . . to protect commerce. . .
祈禱生意興隆時
. . .I would offer up. . .
而我在偷偷想著
. . .secretly. . .
. . . the proudest prayer
a boy could think of.
希望能有那種境遇
''Lord, make me a great composer.
主呀!讓我成為偉大的音樂家
Let me celebrate your glory

在我一生中的每一時刻

And do you know what happened?
你知道發生什麼事嗎?
A miracle!
奇蹟發生了!
我的生命永遠的改變了
My life changed forever.
當然這都是上帝安排的
I knew God had arranged it all .
That was obvious.
很明顯，一分鐘前
我還是個受挫的小孩
One minute I was a frustrated boy. . .
在一個鮮為人知的小鎮
. . .in an obscure little town.
The next I was here. . .
一分鐘後我卻在此
維也納，音樂之城
. . .in Vienna, city of musicians. . .
一位愛好音樂的君王，約瑟夫
. . .and Emperor Joseph,
the musical king.
可稱為音樂的國王
幾年後，我就成了他的宮廷作曲師
In a few years, l was his court
composer. isn't that incredible?
很不可思議吧?
每一晚，我坐在奧皇身旁
與他一起彈琴報導陛下讀樂譜
Every night l sat with
the emperor of Austria. . .
. . .playing duets with him. . .
. . . correcting the royal sight-reading.
事實上那人一點也不了解音樂
Actually, the man had no ear at all .
可是有一點很重要
But what did it matter?
他很欣賞我的音樂
He adored my music.
告訴我...
Tell me. . . .
假如你是我的話...
If you had been me. . .
你會不會覺得上帝已經答應你了?
. . .wouldn�t you have thought
God had accepted your vow?
相信我，我覺得很光榮
And believe me, I honored it.
我是貞潔的典範
I was a model of virtue.
我從不接觸女人
I kept my hands off women.
我每天工作好幾小時，免費教導學生
I worked hours every day
teaching students, many for free!
每天開不完的會議，幫助可憐的音樂家
Sitting on endless committees
to help poor musicians.
工作當時就是我的全部
Work, that was all my life.
那真是太棒了
And it was wonderful .
大家都喜歡我
Everybody liked me.
我也喜歡我自己
I liked myself.
直到他出現
Until he came.
他來到維也納演奏自己的音樂
He came to Vienna to play
some of his music. . .
他當時是沙茲堡主教的門客
. . .at the residence
of the Prince Archbishop of Salzburg .
我立刻去那裡找他
Eagerly, l went there to seek him out.
那一個晚上
That night. . .
改變了我的一生
. . . changed my life.
我穿過宴客廳的時候
As l wandered through the salon. . .
我開始和自己玩一個遊戲
. . .l played a little game with myself.
這個男人四歲的時候
寫出第一首協奏曲
This man had written
his first concerto at the age of 4. . .
七歲的時候
寫出第一首交響曲
. . .his first symphony at 7,
a full-scale opera at 12!
十二歲時寫出第一齣歌劇
Did it show?
這種才華是很明顯的嗎?
is talent like that. . .
是不是寫在臉上的?
. . . written on the face?
他到底是哪一個人呢?
Which one of them. . .
他會不會是...
. . . could he be?
莫札特不在這裡
Mozart is not here.
別鬧了
-Stop it!
-I am.
住手，別鬧了
-Stop it!
-I am stopping it.
我沒有鬧...
I am! I' m stopping it. Slowly.
慢慢的，看到了沒有
There. You see? I've stopped .
我停下來了
-Now we' re going back.
-No!
現在我們又要開始了
不要...
Yes! You don't know where you are.
你不知道你身在何處
這裡一切都是本末倒置的
Here, everything goes backwards.
人們倒著走
倒著跳舞，倒著唱歌，甚至倒著說話
People walk and dance and sing
and even talk backwards.
這真是太愚蠢了，為什麼，人們倒著放屁
-That's stupid .
-Why? People fart backwards.
你說，我生病了
Ssa-ym-ssik!
你說，我生病了
Ssa-ym-ssik!
是的，你是病得很嚴重
Yes, you are. You are very sick.
不，倒過來說
No! Say it backwards, shit wit!
重..
Ssa-ym-ssik.
嚴..
Ssik, kiss.
很..得..病..
Ym, my. Ssa.
重嚴很得病
(音同親我屁股)
Kiss my ass.
親我的屁股
Em-yrram!
我才不玩這個遊戲
-I' m not playing !
-Say it, it's serious.
快說，這是很嚴肅的
It's very serious.
說，我給嫁
Yrram.
嫁...嫁給我
Marry me.
我才不要嫁給你呢
I' m not gonna marry you.
You' re a fiend .
你是個魔鬼
Uoy-evoI-I-tub.
你愛我是可
Tub.
你..愛..我..
But I . . .
是..可..
. . .love. . . .
可是我愛你
But I love you?
便大的我吃
什麼?
-Tihs-ym-tae.
-What?
便..大..
-Eat.
-Eat.
的..我..吃..
-Ym, my.
-My.
吃我的大便
Tihs. Eat my shit.
你這隻骯髒的豬
You filthy fiend !
你這個骯髒...
You filthy--!
我的音樂
My music.
他們沒有我就開始了
They've started without me.
那就是莫札特
That was Mozart!
當我面前打滾嘻戲的小丑
That giggling, dirty creature
I'd just seen crawling on the floor.
我覺得演奏會進行得很順利
沒錯
-I think that went well, don't you?
-Indeed .
維也納人就是會欣賞優美的音樂
The Viennese know good music,
don't you think?
Certainly.
Your Grace.
Ah, Mozart.
莫札特
為什麼?
-Why?
-Why what, sir?
什麼為什麼，皇上
為什麼我要在我的賓客面前
Why do I have to be humiliated
in front of my guests. . .
受僕人的羞辱?
. . . by one of my own servants?
The more license I allow you,
the more you take.
你真是太得寸進尺了
如果皇上不喜歡我
If His Grace is not satisfied,
he can dismiss me.
你可以請我走路
我希望你能立刻回沙德堡
I wish you to return immediately
to Salzburg .
你父親在那裡等你
-Your father is waiting for you there.
-No, Your Grace!
不，皇上
有了這丟臉的事情
I would prefer you dismissed me.
It's obvious I don't satisfy.
我寧可走路
很明顯的我未能使你滿意
我並不打算請你走路
I have no intention of dismissing you.
You will remain in my service. . .
你還是要當我的僕人
同時學點規矩
. . .and learn your place.
在樂譜上看來一點也不起眼
On the page it looked. . . .
Nothing!
The beginning simple, almost comic.
非常簡單的前奏，幾乎有點可笑
低音管，低音號
Just a pulse.
Bassoons, basset horns. . .
好像生鏽的鐵盒子一樣
. . .like a rusty squeezebox.
And then, suddenly. . .
然後，突然間
出現高音的雙簧管
. . . high above it. . .
. . .an oboe.
一個音符不變地飄浮著
A single note, hanging there,
unwavering .
Until . . .
直到黑管接手
. . .a clarinet took it over. . .
. . .sweetened it into a phrase
of such delight.
甜美的調子，充滿了歡欣
This was no composition
by a performing monkey.
這可不是馬戲團猴子所能作的樂曲
This was a music I had never heard .
是我未曾聽過的音樂
Filled with such longing,
such unfulfillable longing .
充滿了無法滿足的情感
It seemed to me l was hearing
the voice of God.
就如同聽到上帝的聲音一般
Excuse me.
對不起!
為什麼?
But why?
Why would God choose an obscene child
to be his instrument?
為什麼上帝卻選了一個年幼無知
的小孩作為他聲音的工具呢?
我絕對不相信
It was not to be believed .
This piece had to be an accident.
It had to be.
這個地方曾經有過意外，一定是
好多了
It better be.
這個莫札特有多好?
How good is he, this Mozart?
He's remarkable, Majesty. I heard an
extraordinary opera of his last month.
他真是完美極了，皇上
我上個月聽過他相當傑出的歌劇
-Idomeneo, King of Crete.
-That?
-《克里特王》那齣歌劇
-那真的是最平凡的作品
A tiresome piece. I heard it too.
平凡?
Tiresome?
A young man trying to impress
beyond his abilities.
一個年輕人不自量力
Too much spice.
太多加料，太多音符
Too many notes.
Majesty. . .
. . .it was the most promising work
I've heard in years.
皇上，那是我近年聽到最好作品
Then, we should make
some effort to acquire him.
那我們應努力將他爭取過來
維也納可以用個好德國作曲家吧
We could use a good German composer
in Vienna, surely?
I' m sure he could be tempted
with the right offer. Say. . .
只要價碼合理，我相信他會有興趣的
-為了我們的國家歌劇院，做一曲德文的歌劇
-太好了，陛下
. . .an opera in German
for our National Theater.
Excellent, sire!
But not German. I beg, Your Majesty.
但皇上，不要德文好不好
義大利文才是得體的歌劇語言
Italian is the proper language
for opera.
All educated people agree on that.
受過教育的人都會同意這一點
你認為如何?內廷大臣?
What do you think, chamberlain?
In my opinion, it's time
we had a piece in our own language.
我認為是該有本國語言歌劇的時候了
Plain German for plain people.
讓老百姓聽德文吧!
Kapellmeister?
卡普麥斯特(宮庭樂團團長)你呢?
Majesty. . .
. . . I must agree with Herr Direttore.
我同意劇場監督的看法
German is. . .
德文...太粗野了，不適合歌劇
. . .too brute for singing .
Court composer. . .
宮庭作曲家，你認為呢?
. . .what do you think?
I think it's an interesting notion
to keep Mozart in Vienna.
我認為將莫札特請來維也納
是很有趣的構想
It should infuriate the archbishop. . .
這會使得大主教非常的憤怒
也許這是陛下的企圖
. . .if that is Your Majesty's
intention.
You are cattivo, court composer.
你說對了，宮庭作曲家
I want to meet this young man.
Arrange a pleasant welcome for him.
我要見見這年輕人
內廷大臣，安排見面事宜
Well, there it is!
好了，就這麼辦
感謝你，上帝
This is a beautiful wig for you.
這頂假髮太適合你了
看起來實在太棒了
It looks so marvelous and I I�ve it.
另一頂
The other one.
Here is the other one.
I think you will I�ve it.
我想你會喜歡這一頂
Here's the third one. So? Here we go.
-How do you like it?
-They' re all so beautiful !
如何?
他們都太美了，我三頂全要
我為什麼沒有三個頭?
Why don't I have three heads?
This is funny!
Three heads!
大家好
Gentlemen.
-Good morning .
-Morning, Your Majesty.
陛下早安
What do you have for me today?
今天為我準備了什麼?
-Your Majesty, Herr Mozart.
-Yes, what about him?
陛下，莫札特先生
他怎麼樣
He's here.
-他已經來了
-就這樣子了，很好
Well, there it is. Good !
皇上，我希望你不會認為不妥
I hope you won't find it improper,
but I've written a march in his honor.
不過，我寫了一個短曲歡迎他
What a charming idea, court composer.
May I see?
想得真週到
我能看看嗎?
Just a. . . .
只是個小曲罷了
Just a trifle, of course.
我能試試嗎?
May I try it?
-我的榮幸
-我們來開心一下
Let's have some fun.
Delightful, court composer!
太棒了，宮庭作曲家!
他進來時我能演奏嗎?
May I play it when he comes in?
-You do me too much honor.
-Bring in Herr Mozart.
悉聽尊便，先生!
帶莫札特來，但..慢慢的
But slowly.
I need a minute to practice.
我要給他驚喜
Good, continue.
很好，先生!
C...
G, Majesty.
Excellent!
很好，繼續
Good, Majesty.
Continue. Very good .
太好了，殿下
Very good, Majesty.
Tempo! Up.
Lightly, then strongly!
It's a march, Majesty.
Again.
Bravo, Majesty!
-非常棒，陛下
-各位，請不要這麼熱情，謝謝
Gentlemen, please.
A little less enthusiasm, I beg you.
-莫札特
-陛下
No, please. It's not a holy relic.
不，我可不是教宗
我們以前曾經見過面...
You know, we have met before.
In this very room.
就在這個大房間裡面
也許你不記得
You don't recall . You were only 6.
He was giving a delightful concert!
你當時只有六歲
就已經演奏了最棒的協奏曲
As he got off the stool, he fell .
他從椅子爬下來時還滑了一跤
My sister Antoinette helped him up.
Know what he did?
我的妹妹安東尼扶他起來
你們知他怎麼了?
他抱住她，然後說：你願意嫁給我嗎?
He jumped into her arms and said,
""Will you marry me? Yes or no?""
You know all these gentlemen.
The Baron Van Swieten.
你一定認識各位先生吧!
范史威登公爵
-I' m a great admirer of yours.
-Thank you.
年輕人，我相當喜歡你的作品
Kapellmeister Bonno.
-卡普麥斯特先生
-我的榮幸
My pleasure.
The Director of Opera,
Count Orsini-Rosenberg .
我們的歌劇院長，羅森保伯爵
Sir, yes. The honor is mine,
absolutely!
這絕對是我的榮幸
Here is our
illustrious court composer. . .
這是我們的宮廷作曲家，薩列里大師
. . . Maestro Salieri .
At last, such immense joy!
我在你很小時就見過你了
I know your work well .
我很熟悉您的作品
You know, I composed some variations
on a melody of yours.
我事實上修改過您的一首作品
-Really? Which one?
- ''Mio Caro Adone. ''
-真的?哪一首?
-《Mio Caro Adone》
-我真是受寵若驚
I' m flattered .
A funny tune,
but it yielded good things.
那是一首奇怪的小品
不過有一些不錯的效果
And now he has returned
the compliment.
Herr Salieri composed
this little march for you.
他現在回報你的讚美
薩列里為你作了一首歡迎你的進行曲
Really?
真的?
先生，謝謝你了
Well, there it is.
Down to business. We' re going
to commission an opera from you.
就是這樣子了，現在我們來談正事
莫札特，我們要舉行一場歌劇，你覺得怎麼樣?
What do you say?
陛下
Did we vote in the end
for German or Italian?
我們最後有無作成決定
是採德文或義大利文?
事實上我們最後較傾向
Sire, if you remember,
we did finally incline to Italian.
義大利文
Did we?
有嗎?
I don't think it was really decided,
Your Majesty.
我認為這還沒有決定，陛下
-German. Please let it be German.
-Why so?
德文...拜託...我們寫德文的
Because I've already found
the most wonderful libretto.
為什麼?
因為我早己找到最精彩的歌詞
我看過嗎?
Have I seen it?
I don't think you have, Herr Direktor.
It's quite new.
院長閣下應該沒有!
我的意思是，這劇本是全新的
-I'll show it to you immediately.
-I think you'd better.
我會立刻拿來給你看
Well . . .
. . .tell us about it.
Tell us the story.
介紹一下，介紹一下故事吧!
Well, it's quite amusing, Majesty.
相當吸引人有趣的，陛下
It's set--
The whole thing is set in a. . . .
背景是在..
整個故事的背景是在...
Yes? Where?
是的，那裡呢?
In a harem, Majesty. In a seraglio.
在一個妓院裡，陛下
-You mean in Turkey?
-Yes, exactly.
你的意思是說土耳其?
沒錯!正是
Then why especially
does it have to be in German?
那何以特別要用德文呢?
It doesn't, especially. It could be
in Turkish if you really want.
其實也不一定要
如果你們喜歡的話
也可以用土耳其文
No, my dear fellow, the Language
is not finally the point.
莫札特，言語不是重點了
Do you really think that subject
is appropriate for a national theater?
你認為這類劇情
真的適合在國家劇院上演?
Why not? It's charming .
為什麼不呢?會很有趣的
I mean, I won't actually show
concubines exposing their. . . .
有那麼多的人在觀賞
我又不會真的讓妓女露出...
這絕對不失禮
It's not indecent.
It's highly moral, Majesty.
它是非常崇高的，陛下
It's full of proper German virtues.
它充滿德意志精神與價值觀
Excuse me, Majesty, but what
do you think these could be?
對不起!陛下，什麼是德意志精神?
Being a foreigner, I'd I�ve to learn.
我是一個外國人，願聞其詳
Well, tell him, Mozart.
那麼，莫札特
告訴他什麼是德意志精神
Name us a German virtue.
-Love, sire.
-Oh, I�ve!
愛，陛下
愛!
Of course, in Italy
we know nothing about I�ve.
當然，我們義大利人不懂愛
No, I don't think you do.
不，我想你不知道的
Watching Italian opera,
all those male sopranos screeching . . .
我指看義大利歌劇時
只見男高音在吼叫尖叫
. . .stupid, fat couples rolling their eyes
about. That's not I�ve. It's rubbish!
一對痴肥的情侶
在那裡翻白眼，拋媚眼
那不叫愛，那是垃圾
Majesty, you choose the Language.
陛下，你選語言
I'll set it to the finest music
ever offered a monarch.
我的工作是
使這成為最優秀的歌劇
Well, there it is.
Let it be German.
好吧!就這麼決定了!
就選德語吧
This is yours.
-這是給你的
-陛下要就留著，我全記在腦子了
Keep it.
It's already here in my head .
什麼?才聽一次就記牢了?
What? On one hearing only?
我想是吧，陛下
I think so, sire. Yes.
彈給我們聽
Show us.
The rest is just the same, isn't it?
接下來都一樣
That doesn't really work, does it?
這裡好像不太順
Did you try. . . ?
你有沒有試過....
是不是應該比較...
Shouldn�t it be a bit more. . . ?
或這樣子比較好...
Or this?
沒錯!
This. Yes.
Better? What do you think?
你認為如何?
Grazie, Signore.
真感謝主
我所要作的，只是以音樂讚美主
All l ever wanted
was to sing to God.
他賜我那分渴望，卻又把我變成啞巴
He gave me that longing . . .
. . .and then made me mute. Why?
為什麼?告訴我原因
Tell me that.
若他真不要我以音樂讚美他
If he didn't want me
to praise him with music. . .
為什麼要給我那分渴望
. . .why implant the desire. . .
就像我對生理上的慾望一樣
. . .like a lust in my body?
然後又否定我應有的才能
And then deny me the talent?
卡瓦里瑞夫人來上課了，大師
Madame Cavalieri is here
for her lesson, sir.
怎麼樣?
Maestro.
Well . . . ?
你喜歡嗎?
How do you like it?
是土耳其樣式，我髮型師說
It's Turkish.
今年流行的是土耳其風格
My hairdresser said everything
this year's going to be Turkish.
Does he?
What else did he tell you today?
你可真是美麗
告訴我最新的傳聞
Come, come! Give me some gossip.
我聽說你看到莫札特
Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart.
維也納的消息傳得真快
News travois fast in Vienna.
而且他奉命寫一齣歌劇，是真的嗎?
And he's been commissioned
to write an opera. Is it true?
是的
-Yes.
-Is there a part in it for me?
有沒有留給我的角色?
沒有
-No.
-How do you know?
你怎麼知道
你知道背景在那嗎?
-Do you know where it's set, my dear?
-Where?
那裡?
妓院
In a harem.
那是什麼?
-What's that?
-A brothel .
妓女院
來吧!我們開始吧!
Come.
Let's begin.
他長得如何?
-What does he look like?
-Mozart?
莫札特?
可能會令你大失所望
-You might be disappointed .
-Why?
怎麼說?
外表和才華往往不是搭配的
Looks and talent don't always
go together, Katerina.
大師，外表我不在乎
Looks don't concern me, maestro.
有品味的女人在乎的只是才華
Only talent interests
a woman of taste.
我們繼續吧!
Shall we continue?
她就在台上
There she was.
我不知道他們何時認識
l don 't know where they met or how.
There she stood!
怎麼認識的
她站在那裡
那裡，舞台上，讓眾人欣賞
On stage, for all to see.
那隻貪婪的黃鶯一樣
炫耀給大家看
Showing off like
the greedy songbird she was.
10分鐘的延長音階
Ten minutes of ghastly scales.
Arpeggios!
上上下下，好像遊樂場的煙火
Whizzing up and down
like fireworks at a fairground.
忽上忽下，隨之跳動
我知道我愛那女人
Understand, I was
in I�ve with the girl .
可是我對你發誓
Or at least in Lust.
我碰都沒有碰過她
And I swear to you,
I never laid a finger on her.
同樣的，我也不能忍受他人碰她
All the same, I couldn�t bear
to think of anyone else touching her.
尤其不能忍受那傢伙
Least of all, ""the creature. ""
Brava, madame!
You are an ornament to our stage.
太好了，夫人
你真是我們舞台上的珠寶
謝謝陛下
Your Majesty.
莫札特先生，傑作
不，這真的是太傑出了
Well, Herr Mozart. A good effort.
Well, decidedly that.
An excellent effort!
You have shown us something . . .
你今天晚上令我們...
-. . . quite new tonight.
-It is new.
大開眼界
這是好消息，令人振奮
-It is, isn't it, sire?
-Yes, indeed .
是很新
是很新
So then, you liked it?
You really liked it, sire?
殿下，你真的很喜歡嗎?
當然喜歡，太精彩了
Well, of course I did ! It's very good !
只不過有一點...
Of course, now and then,
just now and then. . .
它好像摸到某種...
. . .it seemed a touch. . . .
你什麼意思，陛下
What do you mean, sire?
我是說，事情我該如何說呢?
Well, I mean, occasionally,
it seems to have. . . .
我是說，有時顯得似乎...
How shall one say. . . ?
我該怎麼說呢?
How shall one say, direktor?
我該怎麼說?
-Too many notes, Majesty?
-Exactly. Very well put.
陛下，太多音符
對!太多音符
-Too many notes.
-I don't understand .
我不太了解
There are just as many notes
as I required, neither more nor Less.
音符是我所要的
不多也不少
親愛的伙伴，事實上
My dear fellow, there are in fact. . .
耳朵在夜晚所聽的音符很有限
. . .only so many notes
the ear can hear in an evening .
I think I' m right in saying that,
aren't I, court composer?
我想這麼說應該對吧?
宮廷作曲家
是的，是的，陛下!
Yes. On the whole, yes, Majesty.
This is absurd !
真是太荒謬了
親愛的年輕人，別難過!
Young man, don't take it too hard .
Your work is ingenious.
你的作品是天才之作
非常地傑出
It's quality work.
只不過音符太多了，如此而己
And there are simply too many notes.
Just cut a few and it'll be perfect.
只要刪除一些就完美了
Which few did you have in mind?
你認為應該刪除哪一些呢?
Wolfgang !
Wolfgang, my dear!
-Wolfgang !
-Majesty, this is Frau Weber.
陛下，在那邊
陛下，這是韋伯夫人，她是我的房東
-是我的女性觀眾迷
-陛下，真是榮幸
She's my landlady.
-Enchanted, madame.
-Sire, such an honor!
這是我女兒康斯汀
This is my dear daughter, Constanze.
-She's the fianc�e of Herr Mozart.
-Really?
她是莫札特先生的未婚妻
真的?
How charming . Please.
真是迷人!請上來
Well . . .
. . .when do you marry?
你們什麼時候結婚?
我們還未決定
We haven't exactly received
my father's consent yet.
我父親還沒有答應
Not entirely. Not altogether.
-Excuse me, but how old are you?
-26.
對不起，你幾歲了
二十六歲
My advice is for you to marry
this charming young lady. . .
我建議你娶了這迷人的小姐
-. . .and stay with us in Vienna.
-You see?
和我們一起住在維也納
你看!你看!
I told him that,
but he won't listen to me.
我也這麼告訴他，但他不聽
Your Majesty,
you give such wonderful . . .
陛下，你真是提出了...
這麼棒的皇家建議
. . .such royal advice. May I . . . ?
我可不可以...
Well, there it is.
就是這樣子了
WoIfie, will you get some water?
可不可以去拿點水來
Will you get some water, please?
WoIfie, get some water!
Excuse me. Excuse me.
借過，借過
你知道嗎?
Did you know?
-什麼?
-婚事
-What?
-The marriage.
What does it matter to you?
和你有什麼關係?
沒事，他想娶誰就娶誰，和我無關
Nothing . He can marry who he pleases,
I don't give a damn.
我以前怎麼樣?
How was I?
You were sublime.
你風華美麗
And what did you think of the music?
你覺得那音樂怎麼樣?
非常好
Extremely clever.
卡塔尼娜，我...
Katerina, I--
Excuse me.
對不起
那女人還躺在地上嗎?
Is that woman still lying
on the floor?
-No, she's fine.
-Oh, I' m so relieved .
-不，她沒事
-這樣我就放心了
親愛的莫札特，恭喜
Dear Mozart,
my sincere congratulations.
-Did you like it then?
-How could I not?
你喜歡嗎?要是我不呢?
這是當代維也納最好的音樂，是嗎?
It's the best music
in Vienna today, don't you agree?
她在床上一定是眼花繚亂
She must be dazzling in bed .
我敢肯定她是藝術鑒定的行家
I assume she's the virtuoso
in that department.
No other reason why
you'd marry someone like that.
你娶她那樣的人也不足為奇
請進
Come in.
Excuse me.
WoIfie, Mom isn't feeling very well .
抱歉，媽媽的身體不是很舒服
-Can we go home?
-Yes.
我們能回家嗎?好的
No, no, no.
You can't take him away now.
不，你現在不能帶他走
This is his night.
今晚是屬於他的
Won't you introduce us, Wolfgang?
莫札特，你不給我們介紹一下?
Excuse us, Fr�ulein.
Good night, signore.
對不起，晚安
At that moment l knew,
beyond any doubt. . .
在那個時候我就知道
他掌握了她
. . .he 'd had her.
那傢伙奪走了我親愛的女人
The creature had had my darling girl .
It was incomprehensible!
真是難以令人了解!
上帝的旨意為何?
What was God up to?
Was it possible I was being tested?
我有可能去嘗試嗎?
上帝期望我得到原諒
Was God expecting me
to offer forgiveness. . .
. . .in the face of every offense?
在面對所有事的時候嗎?
No matter how painful?
不管有多痛苦?
這是非常有可能的，但為何是他?
It's very possible.
But why him?
為何選擇莫札特來教我謙卑呢?
Why choose Mozart
to teach me lessons in humility?
My heart was filling up. . .
我心中對那年輕人充滿恨意
. . .with such hatred
for that little man.
For the first time in my life,
I began to know. . .
因此我一生中第一次
心中有了殘暴的想法
. . . really. . .
. . .violent thoughts.
Every day, sometimes for hours,
l would pray.
每天，有時好幾個小時，我會祈禱
上帝
Lord . . .

他的原因
For his sake. . .
也是我的原因
. . .as well as mine.
-No! I won't have him back.
-But, Your Grace--
不，我不要他回來
你兒子是被寵壞又任性的壞孩子
Your son is an unprincipled,
spoiled, conceited brat!
Yes, sir. . .
我承認，這是事實
. . .that is the truth.
But don't blame him.
The fault is mine, entirely.
I was too indulgent with him.
但是不要責怪他，這全都是我的錯
求求您，再給他一次機會
Please, Your Grace?
Give him one more chance?
好吧，你可以再試試看
You have leave to try.
God bless, Your Grace!
I thank Your Grace.
謝謝你，謝謝
I thank you!
l write to you with urgent news.
I'm coming to Vienna.
我有緊急的事要告訴你
我要來維也納了

Beloved father:
敬愛的父親，記得你說過
You say Vienna is the musicians ' city.
To conquer here is to conquer Europe.

我們會非常快樂
Good morning .
This is my niece, Princess Elizabeth.
早安，宮廷作曲家
這是我侄女，伊麗莎白公主
Your Highness.
她請我推薦給她一合適音樂教師
She's asked me to recommend
a music instructor.
-I've come up with an excellent idea.
-Your Majesty!
我想我己有一個很好的構想
陛下，那真是我的榮幸
It would be such a tremendous honor!
I was thinking of Herr Mozart.
What is your view?
我想到莫札特，你覺得如何?
It's an interesting idea,
Majesty, but. . . .
那倒是個不錯的主意，但是...
Yes?
My concern is to protect you. . .
我所關切的是...
也許不關我的事，陛下，但
要避免您被人們說閒話，徇私
. . .from any hint of favoritism.
Favoritism.
怎麼了，大臣?
-What is this?
-What is what?
什麼怎麼了
為何我必須把作品送交給
Why must I submit samples of my work
to a committee to teach a girl?
某些愚呆的委員會審查
就為了能當個13歲女孩的教師
因為這是陛下的旨意
Because His Majesty wishes it.
Is the emperor angry with me?
陛下在生我的氣?
-Quite the contrary.
-Then why not appoint me to the post?
剛好相反
那他為何不指派我?
莫札特，維也納作曲家不只你一人
You are not
the only composer in Vienna.
No. But I' m the best.
沒錯，但我卻是其中最好的
Mozart.
莫札特，希望你相信我的話
A little modesty
might suit you better.
謙虛一點對你會更有益
Who is on this committee?
委員會有哪些人?
卡普麥斯特，羅林保伯爵
Kapellmeister Bonno, Count
Orsini-Rosenberg and Salieri .
還有宮廷作曲家
Naturally, the Italians!
Of course, always the Italians!
一想即知，義大利人，當然
總是義大利人
They' re all musical idiots!
他們全是不了解音樂的白痴
-And you want them to judge my music?
-Young man. . .
你要他們審核我的作品
年輕人，問題很簡單
. . .the issue is quite simple.
If you want this position. . .
若你想得到這職位
. . .you must submit your stuff,
along with all your colleagues.
必須拿出作品和其它作曲家一起送審
Must I?
一定要嗎?
Well, I won't.
可惜我作不到
How are we supposed to live?
這樣的日子我們怎麼過?
Do you want me to beg on the streets?
要我在大街上乞討嗎?
別傻了
Don't be stupid .
他們想看到的只是你的作品
-All they want to see is your work.
-Shit.
糟糕
你是怎麼啦?閉嘴!給我閉嘴
-What's wrong with that?
-Shut up! Just shut up.
一個王室學生，整個維也納都會感到震驚的
One royal pupil,
and all of Vienna will come flocking .
他們什麼都會
They'll come anyway.
-No, they won't.
-They I�ve me here.
不，他們不會的他們喜歡我在這
-I know how things work in this city.
-You know everything, don't you?
我對這個城市很清楚你是萬事通
-Yes?
-Excuse me, sir.
-什麼事?
-抱歉，先生
-A Lady insists on taking to you.
-Who?
有位小姐堅持要見您
是誰?

but she says it's urgent.
Excuse me, my dear.
失陪，親愛的
Your Excellency.
How can I help you?
我能幫妳什麼忙?
莫札特夫人?
-Frau Mozart?
-I've come on behalf of my husband .
我是為了我丈夫來的
我帶他部分作品
I brought samples of his work so he
can be considered for the appointment.
讓他更有機會得到皇室的工作
How charming,
but why did he not come himself?
真是太好了，可是他為何不自己來
Well, he's terribly busy, sir.
先生，他非常的忙
我知道
I understand .
I will Look at them the moment I can.
當然我一有空就會看
這是我的榮幸
It will be an honor.
Please give him my warmest regards.
如果你現在就看
會不會太麻煩?
Would it be too much trouble
to ask you to Look at them now?
我在這裡等
-While I wait.
-I' m afraid I' m not at leisure. . .
現在恐怕沒空
. . .this precise moment.
Leave them with me.
I assure you, they will be safe.
就先放我這兒，我保証很安全
I really cannot do that, sir.
我恐怕不能這麼作
You see, he doesn't know I' m here.
事實是，他不知我來這裡
Then he didn't send you?
他沒叫你來?
No, sir. This was my own idea.
是我自作主張
-I see.
-Sir, we' re desperate.
我知道了
先生，我們窮途末路了
We really need this job.
我們真的需要這份工作
My husband spends far more
than he can ever earn.
我先生入不敷出
我不是說他懶情
I don't mean that he's lazy,
because he works all day long .
他一點也不懶，他整天都在工作
只是...
It's just that he's not practical .
他不實際
Money simply slips through
his fingers. It's ridiculous.
他就是守不住錢，這真是太可笑了
Let me offer you some refreshment.
要不要吃些東西
Do you know what these are?
你知道這是什麼嗎?
Capezzolidi Venere!
Nipples of Venus.
維納斯的乳頭
這是包白蘭地糖的核桃，吃一個吧

sugar. Try one. Go on, try one!
They' re quite surprising .
你一定會嚇一跳
They' re wonderful !
很完美，多謝你了，先生
Thank you very much, Your Excellency.
Don't keep calling me that.
別那麼稱呼我，這樣子有距離感
Keeps me at such a distance.
I wasn't born a court composer,
you know.
我不是生下來就當宮廷作曲家
我來自一個小鎮
I' m from a small town.
正和你先生一樣
Just like your husband .
你確定你不能留下這些資料
Are you sure you can't. . .
. . .Leave this and come back again?
改天再來?
It's very tempting, sir.
聽來很不錯，不過恐怕不行
But it's impossible, I' m afraid .
He'd be frantic
if he knew they were missing .
若他發現這些不見了，一定會發瘋的
這些都是原稿
You see, they' re all originals.
-Originals?
-Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.
原稿?
是的，他從來不會複寫
這些全是原稿?
These. . .
. . .are originals?
Astounding!
太不可思議了!
It was actually--
It was beyond belief.
簡直不敢相信!
These were first and only. . .
這些樂稿全是唯一的版本
. . . drafts of music.
But they showed no corrections
of any kind. Not one.
全然沒有任何修改的痕跡
一點也沒有
他只是將在腦中已完成的曲調
He had simply written down music. . .
一成不變的寫下來而巳
. . .already finished in his head .
一頁接著一頁
如同是在聽寫一般
Page after page of it.
As if he were just taking dictation.
And music. . .
. . .finished as no music
is ever finished .
這是前所未見的悅耳音樂
Displace one note. . .
更動任何一個音符就不完美
. . .and there would be diminishment.
Displace one phrase,
and the structure would fall .
更動一小節，結構性就會瓦解
It was clear to me. . .
我現在了解...
. . . that sound l had heard
in the archbishop 's palace. . .
那夜在大主教家中聽到的音樂
. . .had been no accident.
絕不是偶然的
Here again
was the very voice of God.
這些樂稿再次呈現了上帝的聲音
I was staring through the cage. . .
我一小節一小節的看
看那些筆下的音符
. . .of those meticulous ink strokes. . .
. . .at an absolute beauty.
我看到的是完美無暇的音樂
Is it not good?
寫得不好嗎?
這簡直是奇蹟
It is miraculous.
是的，他很以自己的作品為傲

那麼你會幫助我們嗎?
So you will help us?
I dine with the emperor
tomorrow evening .
我明晚和國王商量一下
One word from me and the post is his.
我的一句話，就能給他謀個位子了
謝謝，真是太謝謝你了!

What for?
回報性的服務

No?
不幹嗎?
-What do you mean?
-Isn't it obvious?
-你什麼意思?
-不是很明顯嗎?
It's a post all Vienna seeks.
一個所有維也納人都想得到的職位
If you wish it for your husband,
come tonight.
如果你想你丈夫得到的話，今晚過來
先生，我是個已婚女人
I' m a married woman, sir.
那就算了
Then don't.
你自己看著辦
It's up to you.
別含含糊糊的，這就是代價
And not to be vague,
that is the price.
There is no God of mercy, Father.
沒有憐借之神，神父
只有折磨
Just a God of torture.
夜晚到來了
Evening came.
l sat there, not knowing
whether she would return or not.
我坐在那兒，不知她是否會回來
我從未這麼祈禱過
l prayed as l had
never prayed before.
上帝啊

救救我吧
給我一首真實的音樂
Fill me with one piece of true music.

什麼事?
Yes?
先生，那位小姐回來了
That Lady is back, sir.
Show her in.
帶她進來
Well?
I' m here.
我來了
我丈夫參加音樂會去了
My husband has gone to a concert.
他根本沒有想到我會很開心
He didn't think I would enjoy it.
Well, where shall we go?
我們去哪裡?
待在這裡嗎?
Should we stay here?
Well . . . .
你還想看嗎?
Do you still want to Look at these?
還是我們別再煩了?
Or don't we need to bother anymore?
Suppose we don't, really.
我想還是不用了
帶這個女人出去
Show this woman out.
Stanzi .
史坦絲
史坦絲
Stanzi .
What is it?
怎麼啦?
怎麼回事?告訴我
What's the matter? Tell me.
Tell me.
I I�ve you.
我愛你
I I�ve you.
從今起，我們誓不兩立
From now on, we are enemies.
你上帝和我
You and l.
因為你選了一個好色下流的小孩
Because you choose
for your instrument. . .
作為傳播你聲音的工具
. . .a boastful, lustful,
smutty, infantile boy. . .
而給我的只是
讓我能夠了解他的才華
. . .and give me for reward only the
ability to recognize the incarnation.
因為你不公平不仁慈
Because you are unjust. . .
. . . unfair. . .
. . . unkind. . .
我發誓要拒絕你

l swear it.
我要全力傷害你世上的代言人

your creature on earth. . .
. . .as far as l am able.
我要盡我的能力去害他
我要毀了你的工具
I don't like to talk
against a fellow musician.
我不喜歡和平民音樂家一起談話
當然了
Of course not.
我必須告訴你
I have to tell you.
莫札特和年輕小姐在一起，對他不是很放心
Mozart is not entirely to be trusted
alone with young ladies.
真的嗎?
Really?
我的一個學生，一個非常年輕的歌手
One of my own pupils,
a very young singer. . .
瑪莉亞
. . . Maria Theresa Paradis. . .
. . .told me she was. . . .
對我說她被...
Well . . . .
Well, what?
是什麼?
性騷擾
Molested, Majesty.

Twice, in the course of
the same lesson.
莫札特先生在宮廳等你
There is a Herr Mozart
waiting for you in the salon.
-Whom did they choose?
-Herr Zummer.
-他們選了誰?
-茲姆
Herr Zummer?
茲姆?
但他是個大傻瓜
But the man's a fool !
He's a total mediocrity.
不，不，他已經超過了平庸之才
No, no. He has yet
to achieve mediocrity.
I can't lose this post.
I simply can't.
我不能失去這個職位，就這麼簡單
請你幫個忙
Excellency, please.
我們到宮廷去，你可以和國王說說
Let's go to the palace.
You can talk to the emperor. . .
. . .and tell him that Herr Zummer
is an awful choice.
告訴他選擇茲姆是錯誤的
由他來教公主簡直就是在害她
He could do musical harm
to the princess.
這個世上，除了你和我，沒有誰會害她的
Between us, no one in the world
could do musical harm to the princess.
Look. . .
我必須有學生
. . . I must have pupils.
沒有學生，簡直想像不出
Without pupils, I can't manage.
你不是說你很窮吧?
You don't mean
you' re living in poverty?
不，但我已經傾家蕩產
No, but I' m broke.
這怎麼可能?
Well, how is this possible?
我聽說你的音樂會很成功
I hear your concerts are
quite successful .
They' re stupendously successful .
他們驚人的成功
你沒有座位，問題是沒有人雇你
You can't get a seat.
But no one will hire me.
他們不讓我教他們的女兒，好像我是一個魔鬼
They want to hear me play. . .
. . . but they won't Let me teach
their daughters, as if I was a fiend .
講真的...
Seriously. . .
我能跟你借錢嗎?
. . .is there any chance
you could manage a loan?
只有六個月，最多八個月
Only for six months.
Eight, at the most.
你想六到八個月中改變你的命運?
You expect your fortunes to change
in six or eight months?
不管事實怎樣，我會試試
As a matter of fact, I do.
I am working on something that will
explode like a bomb all over Europe.
我做的事會像炸彈一樣在歐洲爆炸
我會是維也那最富有的人

patriotic feelings of some kind .
Two thou--
我需要兩百弗羅林
Two hundred florins.
That's all I need .
A hundred .
一百?
Fifty.
五十?
你到底打算做些什麼事?
What exactly are you working on?
Really, I can't say.
真的不好說
I don't think you should become known
in Vienna as a debtor, Mozart.
我想你不應該在維也納成為一個負債人，莫札特
However. . .
總之
. . . I know a distinguished
gentleman I can recommend, and . . .
我可以給你推薦一個人
他有個女兒
. . . he has a daughter.
別吵!
Quiet! Quiet!
莫札特先生
Herr Mozart.
歡迎!
別介意，沒事的
Welcome. Pay no attention,
they' re impossible.
我像對待自己的孩子般對待它們
I treat them just like
my own children.
它們當中你要我教誰?
Which of them do you wish me to teach?
That's funny.
真幽默
You' re a funny fellow.
你真有趣
This is the instrument.
I hope it's to your satisfaction.
這是樂器，希望你會喜歡
他當然會喜歡了

Now.
現在

just to give me an idea.
請你彈一首我聽聽，好讓我心裡有底

彈啊
Just go ahead .
Just as if we weren't here.
就當我們不在
一點就行了，彈給聽眾聽
對嗎，莫札特先生?
Part of music, getting used
to an audience. Right, Herr Mozart?
或許我們離開會好些
Perhaps it would be better
if we were left alone.
We' re both a little shy.
我們都覺得有點害差
彈
Play.
-I said play!
-Michael, please.
我叫你彈!
邁克爾，拜託
或許我先彈，可以鼓舞小姐
Perhaps if I play first,
it might encourage the Fr�ulein.
Why don't you Let me try?
讓我試試，好嗎?
Stop it! Stop!
He always howls when he hears music.
別叫!別叫!
它一聽到音樂就大叫
We've got to break him of that habit.
要打破他們這個習債!
We've got to break them
of their habit!
彈奏!
Play. Please.
莫札特先生，請你彈奏，我求你了
Herr Mozart, play. Please, I beg you.
對了，對了
That's it. That's it.
Keep playing !
繼續!
Keep playing ! That's it!
繼續!對了!
Mozart, that's wonderful !
Wonderful !
莫札特，太精彩了!
下次要我教你其他的狗，請通知我一聲
Next time you wish me to instruct
another of your dogs, Let me know.
再見，小姐，太太，先生，再見
Goodbye, Fr�ulein. Goodbye, madam.
Goodbye, sir.
爸爸?
Papa?
Papa!
爸爸!
你怎麼來了?
Why are you here?
Am I not welcome?
不歡迎我來嗎?
Of course, welcome.
Papa, welcome! Welcome!
當然歡迎了，爸爸，歡迎你!
You' re very thin.
Doesn't your wife feed you?
你好瘦
你太太難道不餵你嗎?
Of course she feeds me.
She stuffs me like a goose all day!
她當然會餵好
一整天好像填鴨子一樣
她不在家嗎
-Is she not here?
-No, she had to help her mother.
不，她去照顧她媽了
她就是這樣的人
She's like that.
我岳母是很好的人
Her mother's a very
sweet woman, you'll--
I didn't know you were home.
我不知你在家
甜心，這是我父親
Stanzi, this is my father.
We'll wait. We'll wait.
我們會等一下...
你現在起床好嗎，達令?
Why don't you get up now, my darling?
她實在是累壞了
可憐的女人
She's very tired, poor creature.
You know me. I' m such a pig .
你也知道我散漫成性
我很邋遢
It's not easy cleaning up after me.
幫我打掃可不是一件容易的事
你們難道沒有女傭嗎
Don't you have a maid?
Oh. No. We could if we wanted . . .
沒有
如我們要，我們可請一個
. . . but Stanzi insists on doing
everything herself.
不過史坦絲不想
她堅持一切都要自己做
How is your. . .
你的經濟狀況如何?
. . .financial situation?
再好不過了
Couldn�t be better.
這和我昨天聽的不一樣
That's not what I hear.
你是什麼意思?
What do you mean? It's wonderful .
我們很好啊!
Really, it's marvelous!
People I�ve me here.
真的，大家都很喜歡我
他們說你欠了很多錢
They say you have debts.
Who?
誰說的!
Who says that?
真惡毒的謊話
That's a malicious lie!
你有學生嗎?
Do you have pupils?
我不要學生
I don't want pupils!
他們會防礙我
They get in the way.
我需要空出時間專心作曲
I have to have time for composition.
作曲是賺不到錢的
你也知道
Composition doesn't pay.
You know that.
這首可以賺得到!
That one will .
那是什麼?
What's that?
是秘密
It's a secret.
Secret?
You don't have secrets from me.
什麼秘密?你不需要對我保密
不!不!不!
No! Please! I don't want you to see it.
I don't want anyone to see it.
拜託
我不要你看
我還不要任何人看
You'll be so proud of me.
不過你一定會替我驕做的，爸爸
It'll be the best thing I've
ever done. The best thing anyone--
這會是我最棒的作品
這是有史以來最...
啊!她出來了!
There she is!
看看她!多美啊!
Look at her! Isn't she beautiful?
Now, Papa, confess it.
爸爸，說實話
她是不是最美的媳婦?
-Could you want a prettier daughter?
-Stop it, WoIfie!
別鬧了...
太可惡了
I Look dreadful .
Are you. . .
你懷孕了嗎?
. . .expecting?
是的
-Yes, I am.
-Isn't it marvelous? We' re delighted .
是不是棒極了?
我們非常高興
-May I offer you some tea?
-Who wants tea? Let's go out!
莫札特先生
可不可以幫你倒杯茶?
茶，誰喝茶!
我們出去大吃一頓
This calls for a feast.
You don't want tea, do you?
你不會想喝茶吧，爸爸
我知道，我們去跳舞
爸爸喜歡跳舞
I know! Let's go dancing .
Papa loves parties, don't you?
-沃夫
-什麼?真是無聊!喝茶
How can you be so boring? Tea!
Come on, Papa. Hurry!
Here we go. Good day.
Now!
輸的要罰!
I name the penalty!
I name the penalty!
And the penalty is. . . .
-我們的處罰是...
-把腿給大家看!
-Give her a good one!
-Show us your legs!
Come on, come on!
只是個遊戲罷了，爸爸
It's just a game, Papa.
Thank you.
Herr Mozart, why don't you
name your son's penalty?!
莫札特先生
你決定怎麼罰你兒子吧
Yes, Papa. Name it.
爸爸，說吧!
我一定會作的
Name it. I'll do anything
you say. Anything .
我要你跟我回沙德堡
I want you to come back
to Salzburg with me.
The penalty must be
performed in the room.
爸爸，規則是
處罰必需在現場能夠執行
我覺得這個遊戲很無聊
I' m tired of this game.
我不要再玩了
但處罰是什麼?
But my penalty!
I've got to have a penalty!
必需要處罰我...
我來決定處罰...
I name a penalty!
The penalty is. . .
你的處罰是用巴哈的風格
來演奏我們的小調
. . .you shall play our tune. . .
. . .in the manner of
Johann Sebastian Bach!
把他翻過來
-Turn him over!
-Over?!
現在倒著彈
Now you play it backwards!
再來一首吧!
-Another one! Give me another one!
-Play it like Gluck!
和格拉克一樣的演奏
-無聊!
-韓德爾的!
-Boring . Another!
-Handel !
那我也不喜歡，再一個
I don't like him! Another one!
Play Salieri .
薩列里的作品!
Now that is a challenge!
That is a challenge.
這可是個挑戰
Please! Please!
請讓讓...
繼續吧!取笑我吧!笑吧
Go on. Mock me. Laugh!
笑我的不是莫札特
That was not Mozart laughing, Father.
是上帝!神父
That was God .
That was God Laughing at me
through that obscene giggle.
經由那荒唐的笑聲在取笑我
Go on, Signore. Laugh.
繼續笑我，笑啊!
Show my mediocrity for all to see.
笑我的平庸
展現給大家看
One day I will laugh at you.
有一天，我也會笑你的
在我離開世間前
Before I Leave this earth. . .
我會笑你的
. . . I will Laugh at you.
沃夫...
-WoIfie?
-What?
什麼事?
有個年輕女孩來看你
There's a young girl here to see you.
幹什麼?
What does she want?
她不說
She won't talk to me.
She says she has to speak to you.
她不願意對我說
她說要直接跟你說
Damn.
什麼事?
Yes?
-你是莫札特嗎?
-是的
-Are you Herr Mozart?
-That's right.
我叫蘿拉
My name is Lori, sir.
I' m a maidservant.
我是個女傭
I was asked to come here
and offer my services to you.
有個你的祟拜者付我錢來服侍你
They'll be paid for by an admirer
of yours who wishes to remain. . .
他不希望您知道他的名字
. . .anonymous.
Is this your idea, Papa?
這是你的主意嗎?爸爸
我?
Mine?
你是不是在和開我玩笑?
-Are you playing a trick on me?
-I've never seen this girl .
我這一輩子沒見過這女孩
你是某種玩笑嗎?
-Is this some kind of joke?
-Not at all, sir.
絕對不是，先生
小姐，這是不可能的
Young woman, this won't do.
無論對方多麼慷慨
我的兒子不能接受這種做法
My son can't accept such an offer,
no matter how generous. . .
除非他知道幕後的人是誰
-. . . unless he knows who's behind it.
-I can't tell you that, sir.
可是我真的不能告訴你
-太荒唐了
-才不呢!
-This is ridiculous!
-What is ridiculous?
WoIfie has many admirers in Vienna.
莫札特在維也納有許多祟拜者
大家都喜歡他
People send us gifts all the time.
時常有人送禮物來
You cannot accept her
without references.
可是不知對方底細怎能接受呢
Well, this is none of your business.
這不關你的事
-Whoever sent you is going to pay?
-That's right.
派你來的人會付薪水吧?是不是
沒錯
Splendid ! Now we' re going
to Let a stranger into our house.
好極了
現在我們要讓一個陌生人
進來我們家
我們，誰是我們...
Who is we? Who is letting who--?
你能在外面等一下嗎?
-Could you please wait outside?
-Yes, ma'am.
好的!夫人
聽著，老頭子!
Look, old man!
We spend a fortune on you,
and all you can do is criticize.
我們在你身上花了很多錢
你卻只會成天批評我們
-現在你認為...
-史坦絲
-And now--
-Stanzi !
No! It's right that he should hear!
I' m sick to death of it.
不，他應該要聽到
我真是受夠了
We can't do anything
right for you, can we?
我們怎麼服侍你都不對
You won't have to do anything
for me ever again.
你永遠再也不必替我作任何事了
我要走了
I' m leaving .
不要，爸爸
-No, Papa.
-I won't stay and be a burden.
放心，我不會留在這兒煩你們
沒有人認為你是負擔
No one calls you that.
是嗎?她就是這麼想
She does. She says I sleep all day.
她成天就是在睡覺!
你還不是一樣
只有在吃飯時你才會離開房間
And so you do!
The only time you come out is to eat.
那你要我怎樣
Well, what do you expect?
你希望我在這麼亂的房間生活嗎
Do you expect anyone to walk out
into a mess like this every day?
現在要說我不會管家了
-So now I' m a bad housekeeper!
-So you are. It's a pigsty.
事實上如此!
這屋子總是都像豬窩!每天晚上開派對
When can you start?
什麼時候開始?
現在，太太
-Right away, ma'am.
-Good .
They' re out every night, sir.
每天晚上都是這樣，先生
謝謝
Thank you, sir.
Do any pupils come to the house?
有沒有學生來上課
我沒看見
Not that I've seen.
那他怎麼會有錢花?
Then how does he pay for all this?
他有沒有在工作?
Does he work at all?
Yes, sir. All day Long . He never
leaves the house till evening .
有，整天都在工作!
他要等到晚上才會出門
He just sits there,
writing and writing .
他就坐在那兒不斷的寫
是嗎?
Really?
他寫些什麼?
What is it he's writing?
這個我不知道，先生
I wouldn�t know that, sir.
當然你不明白!
Of course not.
你是個乖女孩
你為我這麼做太好了
You' re a good girl .
You' re very kind to do this.
下次他不在家時，讓我知道一下
The next time you' re sure they'II
be out of the house, Let me know.
謝謝
Thank you, sir.
l think l found out
about the money.
我想我知道他如何生活了
怎麼說?
Yes? What?
He kept seven snuff boxes in here.
他這裡有七個鼻煙盒
我發誓這全都是純金的
l could swear they were all gold.
And now look.
你看，現在只剩一個了
There's only one left.
Where does he work?
他在哪裡工作?
在裡邊，先生
先生們，我剛剛聽說了些消息
可能各位會感興趣
l have just heard some news
that may be of interest to you.
什麼新聞?
What?
莫札特在寫新歌劇
Mozart is writing a new opera.
義大利語的歌劇
An italian opera.
義大利語?
Italian?
還不止這樣
That's not all.
He has chosen for his subject, Figaro.
他選費加洛做為主角
《費加洛婚禮》!
The Marriage of Figaro.
He is setting that play to music?
他將那種劇本寫曲子?
Yes.
是啊!
這《費加洛婚禮》是什麼劇本
What is this Marriage of Figaro?
It's a French play, Kappelmeister.
那是一齣法國的戲劇
It has been banned by the emperor.
是皇上禁止上演的
You're absolutely sure?
你確定嗎?
莫札特先生
大家坐下
Gentlemen, sit down.
莫札特
Are you aware that l have declared
the French play of Figaro...
你可知我已經宣佈
法國戲劇《費加洛婚禮》不得體
...unsuitable for our theatre?
Yes, sire.
是，我知道
Yet we hear you're making
an opera from it.
我們聽說你在寫這齣歌劇
是不是事實?
Is this true?
Who told you?
誰告訴你的?陛下
你現在沒有資格問問題
It is not your place to ask questions.
是不是事實?
Is it true?
-是真的嗎?
-是的，我承認
Yes.
l admit it is.
你可不可以告訴我為什麼?
Would you tell me why?
Majesty, it is only a comedy.
陛下，那只是個喜劇
What you think...
你怎麼想並不重要，莫札特
...is scarcely the point.
陛下的想法才重要
It�s what His Majesty thinks
that counts.
可是，陛下
莫札特，我是寬大的人
l am a tolerant man.
我不會隨便下禁令的
l do not censor things lightly.
When l do, l have good reason.
我決定的事都有理由
《費加洛婚禮》是不好的戲劇
Figaro...
...is a bad play.
It stirs up hatred between classes.
因為它挑動階級之間的仇視
In France it has caused
nothing but bitterness.
法國就是一例
My sister Antoinette writes me
that she is beginning...
我的親妹妹安東妮寫信給我
...to be frightened of her own people.
說她現在很害怕自己的子民
Sire, l swear to you,
there's nothing like that in the piece.
皇上，我對你發誓
歌劇已經沒有那些成分
l took out everything
that could give offense.
我把這些都刪掉了
l hate politics.
我討厭政治
I�m afraid you're
rather innocent, my friend.
我想你太天真了
In these dangerous times...
在這個動盪時期，我不能冒險
...l cannot afford to provoke
our nobles or our people...
讓它刺激貴族或平民的情緒
...simply over a theatre piece.
Majesty, this is just a frolic.
皇上，那只是個談情說愛的喜劇
A piece about love.
Love.
又是愛情
Again!
And it's new!
而且是最新潮的
It�s entirely new. It�s so new
that people will go mad for it.
人們會為它而瘋迷的
l have scenes....
例如第二幕的最後
The end of the second act,
for example....
It�s a simple duet...
一開始是夫妻吵嘴的對唱
...just a husband and a wife quarreling.
Suddenly...
...the wife's scheming little maid
comes in. It�s a very funny situation.
突然有陰謀的女傭跑進來
非常有趣的情景
Duet turns into trio.
二重唱轉成三重唱
The valet enters.
He's plotting with the maid.
然後先生的侍者走進來
他與女傭有陰謀
Trio turns into quartet.
三重唱變成四重唱
Then a gardener comes in.
Quartet becomes quintet,
and so on and on...
然後愚蠢的園丁跑進來
四重唱成為五重唱
然後繼續變成六重唱，
七重唱，八重唱...
...sextet, septet, octet.
陛下你猜我能這樣維持多久?
How long do you think
l can sustain that?
l have no idea.
我不知道
Guess.
猜看看，陛下
Guess, Your Majesty.
猜猜看這種過程可以維持多久
然後再將它加一倍
Imagine the longest
it could be sustained...
...then double it.
6?
六分鐘!
7 minutes.
七分鐘!
8 minutes?
八分鐘?
20, sire! 20 minutes!
二十分鐘，皇上
20 minutes of continuous music.
No recitatives!
二十分鐘不斷的音樂，完全沒有對白
Only opera can do this.
只有在歌劇裡可以這樣處理
In a play, if more than one person
speaks at once...
戲劇中如果二人以上同時說話
...it's just noise.
No one can understand a word.
就只剩下噪音，沒有人聽得懂
But with opera, with music....
但在歌劇中，二十人同時說話
With music you can have 20 individuals
all talking at the same time.
And it's not noise.
It�s a perfect harmony!
不但不是噪音，而是完美的旋律
Music is not the issue.
莫札特，我們不是在談音樂
No one doubts your talent. It�s your
literary judgment that's in question.
沒有人懷疑你的才能
我們是在討論你所選的素材
Even with the politics taken out of it,
it would still remain a vulgar farce.
就算沒有政治的成份
它仍是一個低俗的劇本
Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?
不要將你的才能浪費在廢料上
Surely...
你可以選些更高級的劇本
...you can choose more elevated themes.
高級的!
Elevated!
What does that mean, elevated?
高級!那是什麼意思
l am fed...
我給這些高級的東西煩死了
...to the teeth with these...
...elevated things.
Old dead legends.
全都是古老，沒有生命力的傳說
Why must we go on forever...
...writing only about gods and legends?
為何我們一定要不斷的
只去寫有關神的傳說?
Because they do.
因為神是不朽的
至少他們代表我們心中的永恆
They go on forever.
At least what they represent:
the eternal in us.
Opera is here to ennoble us, Mozart.
歌劇是為了
使我們更高尚的，莫札特
You and me,
just the same as His Majesty.
就如同你我及皇上是高尚的一樣
說得好!公爵
為何要高尚，大家誠實一點
Come on now, be honest!
Who wouldn't rather listen
to a hairdresser than Hercules?
你們誰不是比較愛聽理髮師的話
而不喜歡大力士神話?
Or Horatius or Orpheus.
或是那些大家祟拜的諸神
So lofty, they sound as if
they shit marble!
這些崇高的人
連大便都是大理石
What!
什麼!
Govern your tongue, Mozart,
how dare you!
注意你的用詞!莫札特
你太放肆了!
Forgive me, Majesty.
原諒我，陛下
I�m a vulgar man.
我是個低俗的人
But, l assure you,
my music is not.
但我保証我的音樂絕不低俗
你是很有熱情的人，莫札特
You are passionate, Mozart...
但你並不能說服我們
...but you do not persuade.
陛下，整個歌劇已經完成了
Sire, the whole opera is finished.
你知道我花了多少心血
You know how much work l did?
皇上已經沒有耐心了!
His Majesty has been...
...more than patient.
不讓我演給你看，如何能說服你
How can l persuade you
if l can't show it?
That will do.
夠了，莫札特先生
Let me tell how it begins.
就讓我告訴你序幕是怎樣好了
May l just do that?
我可不可以這麼做，陛下?
只是提一下開頭
Show how it begins?
Please.
好!
There's a servant down on his knees.
And do you know why?
有個佣人跪在地上
您知道為什麼嗎?
不是因為任何人要他那樣
Not from any oppression, no.
Because he's measuring a space.
是因為他在測量
你知道測量什麼嗎?
Do you know what for?
His bed.
他結婚用的床，看看是否放得下
His wedding bed.
To see if it will fit!
Late!
On the beat.
Good!
Yes!
Early!
Mozart is already rehearsing.
莫札特已經開始綵排了
In that case, gentlemen, l think...
既然如此，各位
那我們該盡一切可能的幫助他
...we should help him all we can.
讓他不要激怒皇上
And do our best to protect him
against the emperor's anger.
什麼處份?
What anger?
因為芭雷舞啊!
About the ballet.
什麼芭雷舞?
What ballet?
Excuse me...
陛下不是禁止芭雷舞出現在歌劇
...but didn't
His Majesty specifically...
...forbid the ballet at his opera?
莫札特!
什麼事?
可不可以借一步說話!
A word with you.
Certainly, Herr Direktor.
當然可以，院長先生!
現在!現在!
Now, Herr Mozart!
Five minutes, please.
休息五分鐘!什麼事?
Do you not know that His Majesty has
expressly forbidden ballet in operas?
你不知道皇上禁止在歌劇
中表演芭雷舞嗎?
It�s not a ballet, it's a dance
at Figaro's wedding.
這不是芭雷舞，這是婚禮舞蹈!
沒錯，舞蹈
Exactly. A dance.
皇上當然不是禁止故事中有跳舞
Surely, His Majesty didn't mean
no dancing when it's in the story.
It is dangerous to interpret his edicts.
Give me your score, please.
任意解釋皇上的意旨是很危險的
把樂譜給我
Thank you.
院長先生，你幹什麼?
What are you doing?
你在幹什麼?
What are you doing?
Taking out what you should
never have put in.
除去不適合的部分
求求你
Please.
我沒有別人可求了
l have no one else to turn to.
莫札特，什麼事?
What is it?
你不會相信的!
It�s unbelievable.
The Direktor has actually torn up
a huge section of my music.
院長將我歌劇的大部份都去除
他們說我應該重寫
They say l have to rewrite the opera.
但這作品已經很完美了
But it's perfect as it is.
l can't...
我不能改寫已經是完美的作品
...rewrite what's perfect.
你不能去找他說些好話好嗎?
Please.
Can't you talk to him?
我都很討厭他了，何況是你
Why bother with Rosenberg?
He's no friend of yours.
我真的想殺了他
l could kill him.
l mean, really! Kill him!
我氣的將樂譜丟到火爐中
l threw the entire score into the fire,
he made me so angry.
You burned the score?
-你把樂譜給燒了?
-沒有，我太太及時救回來了
No, my wife took it out in time.
謝天謝地
Thank God.
這種人可以審核我們的作品
真是不公平
It�s unfair that a man like that
should have power over our work.
但有人卻可以控制他
But others have power over him.
我直接跟皇上談
l think I'll take this up
with the emperor.
Excellency...
太好了，真的嗎?
...would you?
我全心全意的去做，莫札特
With all my heart, Mozart.
謝謝你
Thank you.
好了!好了!我又不是教宗
Please, Herr Mozart.
Please, it's not a holy relic.
當然我什麼也沒告訴皇上
l don't need to tell you
l said nothing whatever to the emperor.
我照常去劇場騙騙莫札特
l went to the theatre to tell
Mozart something, anything...
...when suddenly...
突然在第三幕當中
...in the middle of the third act...
...to my astonishment,
the emperor...
從不參觀排演的皇上竟然來了
...who never attended rehearsals...
...suddenly appeared.
這在幹什麼?
What is this?
我不了解
l don't understand.
這就是最前衛的嗎?
Is it modern?
院長將芭雷舞部分的樂曲除去了
The Herr Direktor...
...he has removed un balletto...
...that would have occurred
at this place.
為什麼?
這是你的規定
歌劇院裡不准上演芭蕾舞
Why?
It�s your regulation.
No ballet in your opera.
薩列里，你喜歡這樣子嗎?
Do you like this?
這不是喜不喜歡的問題
It�s not a question of liking.
你的法律這樣規定的
Your own law decrees it, I�m afraid.
看看他們
Look at them!
不...這簡直是亂來
This is nonsense!
配上音樂再讓我看看
Let me see the scene with the music.
-可是，陛下...
-這是命令!
Oblige me!
可不可以配上音樂
再給我們看一次
Can we see the scene
with the music back, please?
當然可以!院長先生
Certainly!
Certainly, Herr Direktor.
將宮庭那一景弄回來
Bring the palace set back in, please.
還原後的第三幕大膽絕妙
The restored third act...
...was bold, brilliant.
第四幕...真是美得不可思議
The fourth...
...was astounding.
一位女士偽裝成一位女傭
l saw a woman...
...disguised in her maid's clothes...
他先生向他傾訴多年未說的情話
...hear her husband speak the first
tender words he'd offered her in years.
只因為他以為她是別人
Simply because he thinks
she is someone else.
我聽到充滿寬恕的音符散在劇場
l heard the music of true forgiveness
filling the theatre...
全場聽眾全部沈醉在那音樂中
...conferring on all who sat there
perfect absolution.
上帝又因莫札特而呈現給世上
God was singing
through this little man...
...to all the world.
Unstoppable.
每一小節都會我覺得失敗得更深
Making my defeat more bitter
with every passing bar.
然後，你知道發生了什麼事
And then...
do you know what happened?
奇蹟
A miracle!
因為那哈欠，我的失敗轉為成功
With that yawn...
...l saw my defeat turn...
...into a victory.
他還算運氣只讓皇上打一次哈欠
Mozart was lucky
The emperor yawned only once.
如果有三次，當晚就會停演
Three yawns...
...and the opera would fail
the same night. Two yawns...
再次的話，最多演一星期
...within a week at most.
With one yawn...
一次的話，作曲家仍然可以
...the composer could still get...
九場!就只有九場
現在就被取消了?
...nine performances! Nine,
that's all it's had...and withdrawn.
我知道!
l know, l know.
真是太令人氣憤了
It�s outrageous.
Still, if the public
doesn't like one's work...
不過大家要是不喜歡的作品
我們還是要接受這事實
...one has to accept
the fact gracefully.
But what is it they don't like?
但他們為什麼不喜歡!
我知道皇上為什麼不喜歡
l can speak for the emperor. You make
too many demands on the royal ear.
因為太長了
他只能集中精神的聽上一小時
He can't concentrate
over an hour.
You gave him four.
你卻要演上個四小時
你認為怎樣?你喜歡嗎?
What did you think of it?
Did you like it at all?
l thought it was marvelous.
很美妙!
Of course.
當然了，這是前無古人之作，我知道
It�s the best opera yet written!
l know it.
他們為什麼不來?
Why didn't they come?
你高估了維也納人的水準
l think you overestimate
our dear Viennese, my friend.
You didn't even give them
a good bang at the end of songs...
你甚至沒有在歌曲結尾時
給他們一些鼓掌的暗示
...to tell them when to clap.
l know.
也許你該在這方面教我一些
You should give me lessons in that.
l wouldn't presume.
雖然我知道有點冒犯
我想請你看我的新作品
Nevertheless, at the risk of imposing...
...I'd like you to see my new piece.
那是我莫大的榮幸
不，這才是我的榮耀
It would be a tremendous honor for me.
No, the honor would be all mine.
謝謝你，莫札特
謝謝你，安東尼先生
l believe...
我相信
...l believe...
這是有始以來最好的歌劇作品
...it is the best opera...
...yet written, my friends.
薩列里
你是音樂界最好的作曲家
You are the brightest star...
維也納與我向你致敬
...in the musical firmament.
You do honor to Vienna...
...and to me.
莫札特!
你來了我很高興
It was good of you to come.
我怎麼可能不來
How could l not?
Bravo, maestro.
你喜歡我的作品嗎?
Did my work please you?
l never knew that
music like that was possible.
我從不知道有人能寫出這種音樂
你只是在恭維我
You flatter me.
不，是真的
One hears such sounds...
當人們聽到這音樂，就會想到
...and what can one say but...
薩列里
...Salieri!
大家都來了!
Everybody's here and we've got guests.
我們有酒!
I've got some more.
你記得我的好朋友希克
You remember
my good friend Schikaneder.
進來別害差
Come in!
Don't be shy. This is...
這位是個好女孩，這位也是
...a very nice girl, and this is too....
Yes, my love?
波非，這而位是從沙德堡來的
These gentlemen are from Salzburg.
沙德堡!
我們正在說沙德堡!
We were just talking about Salzburg.
波非，你父親去逝了
Your father is dead.
可怕的鬼魂出現在他下個作品
So rose...
...the dreadful ghost,
from his next...
...and blackest opera.
舞台上站著的是死去的指揮官
There, on the stage,
stood the figure of a dead commander.
And l knew...
...only l understood...
只有我了解那是他父親的替身
...that the horrifying apparition
was Leopold...
...raised from the dead!
莫札特其實是在召喚他的親身父親
Wolfgang had summoned up
his own father...
在全世界面前表達一個做兒子的孝心!
...to accuse his son
before all the world!
看的真是恐怖而美妙
It was...
...terrifying and wonderful to watch.
And now...
於是瘋狂就在我心中產生了
...the madness began in me.
精神一分為二
The madness of a man
splitting in half.
因為我的影響
Through my influence, l saw to it...
《唐喬望尼》只演了五場
...Don Giovanni was played
only five times in Vienna.
但我五場卻都去了
But, in secret,
l went to every one of those five.
以祟敬的心欣賞似乎只有我一人
在聽他的音樂
Worshipping sound...
...l alone seemed to hear.
在那兒我了解到他生氣的父親
As l stood there, understanding...
雖然死了，可是仍然支配著他
...how that bitter old man
still possessed his poor son...
我開始有了一個可怕的計劃!
...even from beyond the grave...
...l began to see a way...
可以勝過上帝的計劃!
...a terrible way...
...l could finally triumph...
...over God.
莫札特?
我要請你作曲
l have come to commission
work from you.
什麼曲子?
What work?
安魂曲!
A mass for the dead.
What dead?
誰死了?
Who's dead?
一位應享有安魂曲而沒得到的人
A man who deserved
a requiem mass...
...and never got one.
你是誰?
Who are you?
我只是個信差，你接受嗎?
l am only a messenger.
Do you accept?
報酬很好
You'll be well paid.
Do you accept?
你接受嗎?
盡快完成，不要對別人提起這事
Work fast.
And be sure to tell no one
what you do.
我會很快的再來看你
You will see me again soon.
我的計劃很簡單
My plan was so simple...
但卻很嚇人
...that it terrified me.
首先我要拿到安魂曲
First, l must get the death mass,
and then...
然後再完成莫札特的死亡
...l must achieve his death.
什麼?
What?
他的葬禮!
His funeral!
想像一下，莫札特小小的棺材
躺在維也納的中央
Imagine it! The cathedral...
...all Vienna sitting there.
His coffin...
...Mozart's little coffin in the middle.
And then...
然後，一片沈寂中，音樂揚起
...in that silence...
...music!
神聖的音樂，偉大的安魂曲
A divine music bursts out
over them all.
A great mass of death.
Requiem mass for Wolfgang Mozart.
由他生前最好的朋友薩列里寫的
Composed by his devoted friend...
...Antonio Salieri.
多莊嚴，多氣派，多麼熱情
What sublimity!
What depth!
What passion in the music!
薩列里終於受到神的付托
Salieri has been
touched by God at last...
上帝也被迫要聽薩列里的
...and God forced to listen.
也無法阻止薩列里
Powerless to stop it!
我終於也反過來笑他了
l, for once, in the end,
laughing at Him!
使我擔心的，是如何實際殺人
The only thing that worried me...
...was the actual killing.
我怎麼作的呢?
How does one do that?
人們如何能殺人呢?
How does one kill a man?
夢想是一回事
It�s one thing...
...to dream about it.
實際作的時候又不一樣了
Very different when you...
...when you have to do it...
用自己的一雙手
...with your own hands.
Come in!
唐喬望尼
我來吃晚餐
I�ve come to dinner.
晚餐?你瘋了是不是
Dinner! Are you mad?
I�m a nobleman.
我只和與我同高的人吃飯
l only ever dine
with people of my own height.
Stop it!
Be careful! Be careful!
Hold tight!
I�m a famous...
...horseman
And we're a famous horsie
Give me a hoof my darling
And I�ll give you my heart
Take me to your stable
And never more we'll part
Kill me!
Kill me!
We're going to make a soprano stew
And when you make a soprano stew
Shut up!
I�m sick to death of that tune!
Give him some hay, my darling
And I�ll give you my heart
Leporello! Some hay!
We hope
You're contented
With what
We've presented
And love our dove of peace
你覺得如何?
What did you think?
好極了
Wonderful!
他喜歡那些朱儒，我喜歡馬
He liked the little people.
It�s all in good fun.
l liked the horse.
如果你在這裡演《唐喬望尼》
l tell you, if you played
Don Giovanni here...
你必會大獲成功
...you would have had
a wonderful success.
你敗於這裡，不是敗於虛偽的宮廷
You belong here!
Not at the snobby court.
You could do anything you like.
你可用任何體材，愈荒唐愈好
The more fantastic, the better.
That's what people want: fantasy!
那才是人們要的，想像力
你應替我寫個適當的角巴
You write a proper part for me
and a couple of catchy songs...
幾首感人的歌
我保証你一定成功
...l guarantee you a triumph deluxe!
你怎麼認為?
你要付我們多少錢
-What do you say?
-How much will you pay him?
啊!你帶著你的經紀人
l see you brought
your manager with you.
太太，全部收入的一半如何
Well, madame...
...how about...
收入的一半!太太!
...half the receipts?
我是指現付!
Half the receipts!
要現付多少定金
I�m talking about now.
How much will you pay him now?
定金!你以為我是誰?皇帝?
Down payment.
Down payment?
Who do you think l am, the emperor?
我該走了，好好欣賞下一段
l have to go.
Stay, you'll enjoy this.
你不會接受吧!
You won't do this.
為什麼不，全部收入的一半
-Why not? Half the house!
-When?
什麼時候?我們現在就需要錢
We need money now! Either he
pays you now, or you don't do it.
不是付定金就是不作
史坦絲!
l don't trust that man.
我不信任他
And l don't like what he did
with your opera. It was common.
也不喜歡他處理你歌劇的方式
太通俗
不過你喜歡吧，小伙子
You liked it.
Monkey, punky, flunky!
Half the house!
You'll never see a penny.
收入的一半!你一毛也拿不到!
我要現在拿到手!
l want it here in my hand.
好呀!在這兒
I�ll put it here in your hand.
閉嘴，沒有錢別碰我
You won't put a thing in my hand
until l see some money!
真是令人為難
It's embarrassing . Can't you think of
anyone who can do something for him?
你能想像有能為他做事嗎?
I' m afraid Mozart
is a lost cause, baron.
我想莫札特可能是最後一個
He has succeeded in alienating
practically the whole of Vienna.
他在維也納取得了巨大成功
他從未還錢
He never pays his debts.
我想像不出我能把他推薦給誰
l can 't think of anyone
to whom I�d dare recommend him.
Herr Mozart. What a surprise!
莫札特，真是奇怪!
What can I do for you?
有什麼能幫你嗎?
Is my pupil still interested
in learning the art of music?
我的學生對學習音樂依然感興趣嗎?
Your pupil is married
and living in Mannheim, young man.
你的學生已經結婚住在很遠的地方，年輕人
Really?
真的嗎?
或許你的...
Perhaps your dear wife might care
to profit from my instruction.
親愛的老婆想學習呢?
怎麼了?莫札特?
What is it, Mozart?
你怎麼了?
What's the matter with you?
既然這表明沒人想請我
Well . . .
. . .since it appears no one
is eager to hire my services. . .
您能幫忙借點錢給我嗎?
. . .could you favor me
with a little money instead?
用來做什麼用?
What for?
If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.
一個男人賺不到錢，就得去向別人借
那樣很難
That's hardly the way to go about it.
You are right, sir. You are right.
你說得對
But you see, I am endowed
with talent, and you with money.
你也知道，我才華洋溢，你很富有
如果我給我的
你就得把你的給我
If I offer mine. . .
. . .you should offer yours.
I'm sorry, no.
對不起，不行
Please.
求求你
My answer is no, Mozart.
我的回答是不，莫札特
Please.
拜託!拜託!
Please!
莫札特!莫札特!
別理他
Don't answer it.
為何?
Why?
告訴他我不在，說我正在作然後回來
Tell him I'm not here.
Tell him I'm working on it.
Come back later.
抱歉，打擾你了!
Am I interrupting something?
-No.
-Good.
我的朋友呢?不在這裡
Where's our friend?
He's not here.
他說他正在繼續作曲中
But he said he's working on it.
那些嗎?
Is that it?
他滿意嗎?
Is he happy with it?
這是什麼?安魂曲
What's this?
A requiem mass?
認為我是在參加葬禮
You think I'm in the funeral business?
Put it down! Put it down!
放下，那不是給你的
Put it down,
it's nothing for you!
I'm sorry.
我要你替我作的曲你寫了沒有
What have you got for me?
Finished?
What?
The vaudeville, what do you think?
是的!我能看看嗎?
Yes.
不能!為什麼不能?
Can I see it?
No.
Why not?
因為沒有什麼可看
Because there's nothing to see.
聽著，你說下禮拜可排演的
I asked you if we could start
rehearsals next week and you said yes.
可以呀!
We can.
在那兒?讓我看看
So let me see it.
Where is it?
Here.
全在我腦子裡
It's all right here in my noodle.
剩下的只要喝酒及把它寫下來
The rest is just scribbling.
Scribbling and bibbling,
bibbling and scribbling.
你想喝點東西嗎?
Want a drink?
你這小子，你知道我雇了多少人
Do you know how many people
I've hired for you?
有多少人在等著嗎?
別來煩他
我要付錢給人家，你知道嗎?
Leave him alone!
他已盡他的全力了
I'm paying these people!
He's doing his best.
我付錢而卻來等你寫完曲子
I'm paying them to wait for you.
It's ridiculous!
真是太有趣了!
你知道什麼叫有趣嗎?
You know what's ridiculous?
Your libretto's ridiculous!
是嗎?只有白痴才會要這種劇本
Only an idiot would ask Wolfie
to work on that!
弄蛇的摩笆
12-foot snakes, magic flutes?
那麼寫安魂曲又有多高明
What's so intelligent about a requiem?
錢!錢!
Money.
You're mad.
瘋了!顯然他已瘋了
She's mad.
Wolfie, write it down.
寫下來，兄弟!把你的靈感寫下
Just write it down.
On paper.
在你的腦中根本沒有用
It's no use to anybody in your head.
To hell with your death mass!
去你的，安魂曲
走!走!你是怎麼了
Calm yourself.
What's the matter with you?
我不再到那兒工作了
I'm not working there anymore.
為什麼?發生什麼事?
What has happened?
你不知道是怎麼一回事
You don't know what it's like.
莫札特令我害怕
Herr Mozart frightens me.
他整天喝酒
He drinks all day...
並且吃藥，使他變得更糟
...then takes all that medicine
and it makes him worse.
他有沒有在工作?
Is he working?
我好怕，真的!
I'm frightened, sir, really!
當他講話時，根本就是胡言亂語
When he speaks he makes no sense.
他有沒有在工作?
Is he working?
我想有吧!
I suppose so.
他常坐下來寫什麼歌劇的
He sits there all the time,
doing some silly opera.
歌劇?
求求你別再叫我回去
Please, don't ask me to go back again.
我好怕!我真的好怕
I'm frightened.
I'm very, very frightened!
你確定是歌劇嗎?
Are you sure it's an opera?
我還沒有作完
I don't have it yet.
你答應了我的要求
Are you neglecting my request?
不..哦...
我答應過你
I promise you.
要給你寫一個好歌劇的
I'll give you the best piece I ever--
這是我太太
This is my wife.
我已工作了一整夜，對嗎?
I've been sick but I'm
all right now, aren't I?
是的，沒錯
Yes, sir.
He's all right.
而他也很辛苦的在工作
And he's working on it very hard.
我還需要兩個星期，求求你
Two more weeks.
Please.
我會盡力完成它的，我保証!
The sooner you finish,
the greater your reward. Work!
莫札特
我想你是真的發瘋了
I think you really are going mad.
自從我們來此後
You work like a slave for that idiot
actor who won't give you a penny!
你替那白痴演員作得像個下奴
而他卻分文末付
And here....
This is not a ghost!
而這個人，他不是個鬼
This is a real man
who puts down real money.
他是個活生生的人
且付你錢
你為何不完成它呢?
Why on earth won't you finish it?
你能給我個我能了解的理由嗎?
Can you give me one reason
I can understand?
他這麼作是在殺我
It's killing me.
你醉了!對不對?
You're drunk, aren't you?
蘿拉說你一直在喝酒
Be honest, tell me.
You've been drinking.
It's not fair.
太不公平了
我一天到晚都在擔心你
I worry about you all the time.
I do everything I can to help you.
盡一切力量來幫助你
And all you do is drink
and talk nonsense, and frighten me.
而你卻只會喝酒
胡言亂語，和嚇我
你回床上去吧!
Go to bed!
Please.
我寧可坐在此
Let me sit here.
Let me stay here with you.
跟你坐在此
甜心
我作的
我為此感到驕做
I did it!
And I was proud to do it.
我告訴她說，走吧!
Leave, I said!
Right away!
帶著孩子一道走吧!
And take the child with you!
Here's the money! Go to the spa...
這兒有錢去那間修養所去
尋回你的健康吧!
...and get your health back.
I was shocked...
令人吃驚!看到她變成那種模樣
...shocked to my foundation
when I saw her.
I couldn't believe my eyes,
poor little thing.
可憐的孩子
我不敢相信我的眼睛
你這個魔鬼
You monster!
No one exists but you, do they?
沒人比得上你，是不是
你和你的音樂
You and your music.
我警告過她
I warned her.
''Choose a man, not a baby,'' I said.
選個男子漢，不要選個小孩
如她嫁給你，一生不幸
You marry him,
you won't have a pot to piss in.
你這自私的東西
You selfish thing!
你這自私的東西
你聽見了嗎?
Selfish, that's what you are.
Selfish.
Simply selfish!
Do you hear me?
扶他起來，把他扶起來
Pick him up.
小心，過來幫忙!
Be careful!
Come with me!
You! Follow me.
你跟我來
結束了嗎?結束了
Is it over?
你不要去管
Yes, it's over.
It's over.
走!
Go!
走吧!走!走!
Go!
Where is your wife?
你太太呢?
Where is your wife?
She's not well either.
She went to the spa.
她身體不好，去休養處了
你對我真好，我非常感謝你
You are so good to me.
Truly.
Thank you.
不要!請你不要掛意
Please!
No, I mean, to come to my opera.
真高興你來看我的歌劇
You are the only colleague
of mine who came.
我真的太榮幸了
莫札特
我從不錯過你寫的任何作品
I would never miss anything
you had written.
你太謙虛了
It's just a vaudeville.
不!超絕的作品
It's a sublime piece.
祟高的作品
The grandest operone!
I tell you...
我告訴你
你是我所知的最偉大的作曲家
...you are the greatest
composer known to me.
Do you mean it?
It's him!
是他!是誰?
The man.
那個人，他來了
He's here.
叫他走開!
Tell him to go away.
告訴他我有事別讓他進來
Tell him I'm still working on it.
Don't let him in.
不，等等!
Wait!
告訴他我改天再見他好了
Ask him if he would
give me some money now.
Tell him it will help me finish.
薩列里!是的
他在嗎?他在睡覺
-Can we come in?
-Better not.
He's sleeping.
He's all right?
我知道他暈倒了，他還好嗎?
Yes, he's just exhausted.
是的他只是太累了
頭昏昏的
He became dizzy.
That's all.
Tell him we came by, won't you?
告訴他我們來過好嗎?
Of course.
Give him this.
給他這個，他的報酬
That's his share.
-That should cheer him up.
-Indeed!
這會使他高興
當然!
And now good night to you all.
It was...
各位晚安!真的是完美之作
...perfection. Truly!
Thank you.
怎麼回事?
What happened?
He said to give you this.
他說給你這個
而他明晚還會再來
And if you finish by tomorrow...
他不會再等下去了
...he'll pay 100 ducats more.
That's too soon!
那太趕了，明天晚上!
Tomorrow night....
不可能!
It's impossible!
Did he say 100?
他說1OO元?
It's too soon!
太趕了!
Could I help you?
我能否...我能幫你忙嗎?
你會嗎?
Would you?
事實上你能的
Actually, you could.
我要走!去哪兒
-I want to go!
-Where?
Back to Vienna.
-我要回去維也那!
-現在?
Now?
-是的!
-為什麼?
-Yes.
-Why?
我覺得不對
I feel wrong.
我覺得在這裡不大對
I feel wrong being here.
Where did I stop?
在什麼地方停了
The end of the Recordare.
在這一句
So. Now, confutatis...
...when the wicked are confounded.
你怎麼翻譯這一段歌詞
How would you translate that?
付諸地獄之火
''Consigned to flames of woe.''
你相信這種說法嗎?
You believe in it?
A fire which never dies,
burning you forever.
火永不滅，永遠燃燒著你
火永不滅，永遠燃燒著你
Yes.
Is it possible?
來吧，讓我們開始繼續作曲
Let's begin.
We ended in F-major.
我們在降F大調停了

全都相同音符嗎?

That's it. You have it?
You go too fast.
One moment please!
One moment!

讓我看全部譜曲
Good! Show me!
The whole thing!
From the beginning!
你要休息一下嗎?
Want to rest?
不，我一點也不累
No, I'm not tired at all!
我們停一下
We'll stop...
...for a moment.
Then we'll finish the lacrimosa.
然後完成最後一段
我能繼續作，我保証我不累
I can keep going, I assure you!
你能陪在這，讓我休息一下嗎
Stay with me while I sleep a little?
我不會離開你的
I won't leave you!
-好慚愧!
-慚愧什麼?
I�m so ashamed.
Of what?
我好傻!我以為
你不在乎我的作品或是我個人
I was foolish.
I thought you did not care
for my work...
...or me.
原諒我
Forgive me.
你在這裡幹什麼?
What are you doing here?
我在幫助莫札特，他病了
Your husband...
...took sick.
I brought him home.
我帶他回來
為何是你?
Why you?
因為我就在旁邊
Because Madame, I was at hand.
非常感謝，你現在可以走了
Thank you very much,
you can go now.
他需要我，太太
He needs me.
不，他不需要
No, he doesn't...
我不許你在這裡
...and I don't want you here.
請你走吧!
Just go, please.
他病得很重
我會照顧他的
He asked me to stay.
And I'm asking--
莫札特
莫札特!我回來了
I'm back.
我多麼想念你
I missed you so much.
只要你表示需要我
If you'd just...
...show me that you need me.
我也會盡力作好你的妻子
And I'll try to do better, too.
這是什麼?
What is this?
你是想來自他的
No, Wolfie, not this.
這些東西把他害慘了
我不讓他被繼續傷害下去
You're not to work on this ever again.
我已經決定了
I've decided.
這不是他的筆跡
It's not his handwriting.
那是我的
No, it's mine.
我幫他寫下
I was assisting him.
他不再寫這些了
He's not to work on this anymore.
是這些導致他生病
It's making him ill.
晚安
Good night.
很抱歉沒有僕人送你出去
I regret we have no servants
to show you out, Herr Salieri.
請見諒!並請你回去
Respect my wish and go.
夫人，我要尊重你先生的意思
I will respect his.
莫札特
你慈悲的上帝
Your merciful God.
他毀掉他最愛的人
He destroyed his own beloved...
而不願讓那些庸才
...rather than let a mediocrity...
分享他榮耀中的一小點
...share in the smallest part
of his glory.
他殺了莫札特
He killed Mozart.
卻讓我活在世上忍受折磨
And kept me alive to torture.
32年的折磨，32年
32 years of torture.
32 years...
我慢慢在發現我自己成為老人
...of slowly watching myself
become extinct!
我作的音樂，逐漸為人淡忘
My music...
...growing fainter.
越來越被世人遺忘
All the time fainter...
再也沒人演奏了
...till no one plays it at all.
而他的
And his....
早安!大師，該刷洗了
Good morning!
Time for the water closet.
我們準備了你最愛吃的早餐
Then we have your favorite breakfast.
Sugar rolls!
He loves those.
Fresh sugar rolls.
我會為你申言，神父
I will speak for you, Father.
我為全天下的庸才申言
I speak for all mediocrities
in the world.
我是他們的鬥士
I am their champion.
I am their patron saint.
庸才到處都是
Mediocrities everywhere...
我宣布赦免你
...I absolve you.
我宣布赦免你
I absolve you.
我宣布赦免你
我宣布赦免你們所有人
I absolve you all.
劇終
謝謝觀賞
