大學時雖已學過
但複習無妨
I know many of you had this as
undergraduates, but it won't hurt to brush up.
謝謝,史蒂芬
Thank you, Steven.
I also put an advanced Fourier system
on the main hallway chalkboard.
走廊黑板上有高級傅立葉算式
I'm hoping that one of you might
prove it by the end of the semester.
希望學期結束前有人會解
Now the person to do so will
not only be in my good graces...
解出來的人不只有好成績
還可因此紀錄名利雙收
but also go on
to fame and fortune...
by having their accomplishment
recorded and their name printed...

朋友的準老婆只能上幾次
There's only so many times you can
bang your friend's future wife.
It's wrong.

除非妳今晚陪我喝酒
或許吧,但我們急著想弄清楚

弄清楚什麼?
是誰解出傅立葉算式?
This is correct.

是他媽的卡邁,我討厭他
That fuckin' guinea. I hate that
little bitch. Will knows him.
威爾認識他
Yeah, I do.
Yeah, fuckin' Carmine Scarpaglia.
你認識他?
他幼稚園時把我揍得好慘
- That guy used to beat the shit out of me in kindergarten.
- That guy?
那個人?
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
真的?
Fuck this.
Let's get some food.
操他媽的,去弄點東西吃吧

- Fuck her.
摩根,你不跟她講話嗎?
去她的
我寧可吃大漢堡
- I could go for a Whopper.
- Let's go to Kelly's.
我才不吃漢堡
到"凱利"去吧
Morgan, I'm not goin' to Kelly's just
'cause you like the take-out girl.
才不要去
你只是喜歡那兒的外賣女孩
而且要多繞15分鐘路
- It's 15 minutes out of our way.
- What the fuck are we gonna do? We can't spare 15 minutes?
他媽的我挪不出15分鐘嗎?
Double burger.
大漢堡
Double burger.
Double burger.
大漢堡
Chuck, I had
a double burger.
查克,我有點大漢堡
Would you shut the fuck up!
I know what you ordered. I was there.
閉嘴,我知道你點什麼
- So give me my fuckin' sandwich.
- What do you mean, your sandwich? I bought it.
那就把我的三明治給我
什麼叫你的三明治?是我買的
Morgan, how much money
you got on you?
你身上有多少錢?
I said I'd get change
when I get the snow cone.
買霜淇淋就會有零錢了嘛
I said that when we pulled up. Give me
my sandwich and stop bein' a prick.
漢堡給我,別這麼討厭
All right, well, give me your fuckin'
16 cents that you got on you now.

We'll put you on a program. Every day
you come in here with your six cents.
每天六分錢,週末給你漢堡
- At the end of the week, you get your sandwich.
- Are you gonna be an asshole?
你怎麼這麼惡劣
你他媽的以為我賣慈濟漢堡啊
What am I, fuckin' sandwich welfare? I think
you should establish a good line of credit.
你應該建立良好信用
Like how you bought
your couch- payment plans.
對,就像你們買沙發那樣
Remember how your mother brought in
ten dollars every day for a year.
記得你媽每天存十塊錢嗎?
She finally got her couch
Rent-A-Center style.
最後她終於買到沙發了

- Here's your fuckin' double burger.
可以把食物給我了嗎?
把你的大漢堡拿去
- Whoa!

還不知道
- I don't know yet.
- Hey, douche bag!
混蛋
Yeah, you, you skank face!
閉嘴
- Shut the fuck up. - Get outta
here. - What are you worried about?
算了,威爾
Why don't you lick
my love stick?
15分鐘前才在公園看到他
We seen the guy 15 minutes ago. We should've
fight him then. We're eatin' our snacks now.
要扁他當時就該扁了
閉嘴,摩根,你也下去

我才不去
那就別去
- I'm not goin'.

你他媽的給我去,摩根
Let me tell you somethin'. If you're not
out there in two fuckin' seconds,
我跟你講,兩秒內不滾出去
when I'm done with them,
you're next.
等我扁完他們,就扁你
Carmine, it's me, Will. Remember,
we went to kindergarten together.
卡邁,是我,威爾,記得嗎?
我們是幼稚園同學
# Way down the street
there's a light in his place #
- # He opens the door, he's
got that look on his face #

他在幹嘛?他把他扁慘了
Get his ass on the ground.
Stop that motherfucker.

怎麼樣?謝謝你們出來
- Hey, fellas, thanks for comin' out.

過來
Whoa! Whoa!
操
Ah. Fuck.
Is it just my imagination,
or has my class grown considerably?
這是做夢還是班級變大了?
Well, by no stretch
of my imagination...
你們是來聽我講課
do I believe you've all come here
to hear me lecture.
或想知道神秘數學奇才是誰
Rather, to ascertain the identity
of the mystery math magician.
So without further adieu, come forward,
silent rogue, and receive thy prize.
沉默的天才,出來領獎吧
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint
my spectators, but...
抱歉讓觀眾失望了
看來今天不會揭曉了
it seems there will be
no unmasking here today.
However, uh, my colleagues and I
have conferred,
我和同事決定再下戰帖
外面黑板上有個題目
and there is a problem
on the board right now...
that took us
more than two years to prove.
我們花了兩年時間才解開
請沉默的天才再解解看
So let this be said:
The gauntlet has been thrown down,
but the faculty have answered
and answered with vigor.
全體教授已備有解答
Hey, when's the arraignment?
幾時提訊?
Next week.

Sorry.
對不起

Oh, you're a clever one.
What's your name?
別耍聰明,你叫什麼名字
Oh, my God.
我的天
Looks right.
好像是對的
Will, how retarded do you gotta be
to get fired from that job?
要多智障才會被開除?
在屋子裡掃地有那麼難嗎?
I mean, how hard is it
to push a motherfuckin' broom around?
你連掃地都會被開除
Mitch, you got fired
from pushin' a fuckin' broom.
I got fired 'cause
management was restructuring.
那是因為管理階層重組
對,重組智障兒的數量
Yeah, restructuring the amount
of retards they had workin' for 'em.
閉嘴,你被開除的次數更多
Shut up. You get canned
more than tuna, bitch.
起碼現在我有工作
At least I got a motherfuckin' job
right now, don't I?
是啊
- Why'd you get fired, Will? Come on.
- Management was restructuring.
威爾,你為何被開除?
管理階級重組
- My uncle could probably get you on a demo team.
- Can he do that?
我舅舅或許能給你工作
你可以幫我嗎?
You kiddin' me! I asked you
yesterday if I could get a job.
你耍我,我昨天還問過你
And I told you "no"
yesterday.
我昨天告訴你不行

up, Case? - What's up, Big Case?
怎麼樣?蓋斯...
坐這邊
Let's sit over here.
All right. Let's go.
Oh, this is- this is
a Harvard bar, huh?
這就是哈佛酒吧?
我以為牆上會有方程式呢
I thought there'd be, like,
equations and shit on the wall.
我要一壺店裡最好的啤酒
I will take a pitcher
of the finest lager in the house.
Timeout. I'm gonna have to bust a little move
on them Harvard hotties down there at the bar.
暫停
我要去泡吧台的哈佛辣妹

兩位美女...
常來嗎?
Do I come here?
I come here a bit.
我常來嗎?我...
偶爾來
I'm here, you know,
from time to time.
- Do you go to school here?
- Yep.
妳們在這兒念書
對
- Yeah, that's it. I think I had a class with you.
- Oh, yeah. What class?
就是嘛,我想我跟妳同班
是嗎?哪一班?
- History.
- Maybe.
歷史
或許
Yes, I think
that's what it was.
應該沒錯,妳可能不記得我
You don't necessarily- may not
remember me. You know, I like it here.
我來這邊並不表示我是天才
- It doesn't mean 'cause I go here, I'm a genius. I am very smart.
- Hey.
但我還是很聰明
你好嗎?
- Hey, how's it goin'? How are ya?
- Good. How ya doin'?
好,你呢?
What class
did you say that was?
你說你在哪一班?
- History.
- Yeah.
歷史
Just history? It must have been
a survey course then.
歷史?那一定是概論課程
- Yeah, it was. It was surveys.
- Right.
對,是概論課程
你應該上上看,不錯的課
You should check it out. It's a good
course. It'd be a good class.
- How'd you like that course?
- You know, frankly,
你覺得那堂課怎麼樣?
老實說,我覺得很基礎
- I found that class, you know, rather elementary.
- Elementary.
基礎,肯定是的
- You know, I don't doubt that it was.
- Yeah.
我記得那堂課了
I, uh,
I remember that class.
就在休息和午餐之間
It was, um-
It was just between recess and lunch.
Clark, why don't you
go away?
克拉克,你走開啦
- Why don't you relax?
- Why don't you go away?
放輕鬆點
走開啦
我跟我的新朋友很開心
- I'm just havin' fun with my new friend.
- Are we gonna have a problem?
有什麼問題嗎?我不懂
No, no, no, no.
There's no problem here.
沒問題
只是想請教你對於市場經濟...
I was just hoping you might give me
some insight into the evolution...
在南部殖民地發展的看法
of the market economy
in the southern colonies.
我主張在革命戰爭前
My contention is that prior to the
Revolutionary War, the economic modalities...
南方殖民地的經濟形態
especially
in the southern colonies...
could most aptly
be characterized as...
最適切被刻畫為農地...
- agrarian precapitalist.
- Let me tell you somethin'.
那當然是你的論點,新生嘛
Of course that's your contention.
You're a first-year grad student.
You just got finished readin' some Marxian historian
- Pete Garrison, probably...
才剛念完馬克斯主義
下個月念到雷蒙的論點
You're gonna be convinced of that till
next month when you get to James Lemon.
你會更深信不疑
Then you're gonna be talkin' about how the
economies of Virginia and Pennsylvania...
然後你會談到維吉尼亞州及賓州
were entrepreneurial
and capitalist way back in 1740.
在1740年
如何企業化與資本主義化
That's gonna last until next year. You're
gonna be in here regurgitatin' Gordon Wood,
一直持續到明年你反芻伍德
talkin' about, you know,
the prerevolutionary utopia...
大談革命前烏托邦
and the capital-forming effects
of military mobilization.
和軍事動員對資本形成的影響...
Well,
as a matter of fact, I won't,
事實上我反對這個觀點
because Wood drastically
underestimates the impact of...
因為伍德完全低估了社會...
Wood drastically underestimates
the impact of social distinctions...
伍德低估了財富的社會差異
predicated upon wealth,
especially inherited wealth.
尤其是繼承財富
這是你從維克斯讀到的論點
You got that from Vickers'
Work in Essex County. Page 98, right?
"艾群就業分析",98頁
我也讀過
I read that too. Were you gonna
plagiarize the whole thing for us?
你要剽竊整本書嗎?
Do you have any thoughts
of your own on this matter?
對這些論點
你有個人想法嗎?
Or is that your thing? You come into
a bar. You read some obscure passage.
你跑到酒吧來
高談書中的論點
Then pretend-
pawn it off as your own.
還假裝是自己的觀點
As your own idea just to impress
some girls? Embarrass my friend?
就為了泡妞、糗我朋友嗎?
See, the sad thing about a guy like
you is, in 50 years,
你的可悲是在五十年後
你才會開始了解
you're gonna start doin'
some thinkin' on your own.
生命中有兩件事是確定的
You're gonna come up with the fact that
there are two certainties in life.
一是別只會打高空
One: Don't do that.
And two: You dropped 150 grand
on a fuckin' education...
二是你花一萬五所受的教育
用一塊五就能在圖書館得到
you could've got for $1.50
in late charges at the public library.
對,但我會有文憑
Yeah, but
I will have a degree,
你卻只能在我去滑雪勝地途中
and you'll be servin' my kids fries at a
drive through on our way to a skiing trip.
賣薯條給我的小孩
Maybe, but at least
I won't be unoriginal.
或許吧,起碼我不會沒創意
If you have a problem with that, we could
step outside. We could figure it out.
不爽可以到外面解決
No, man, there's no problem.
It's cool.
不,沒事,很酷
- It's cool?
- Yeah.
酷?
- Cool.
- Damn right, it's cool.
你他媽的酷斃了
How do you like me now?
現在喜歡我了吧
那小子聰明絕頂
My boy's wicked smart.
I just spent three minutes in this
fuckin' place and run into a barney, huh?
才來三分鐘就擺平一個傻蛋
There it is.
我來,有了,吉米,你好
- Nice to meet you.
- They were fine, man.
我們差點就要把到她們
I was gonna close the deal, but then
Chuck- Billy insulted one of 'em...
結果比利觸怒她們,辣妹就說
The heavyset girl said I had a receding
hairline, and I was a few pounds overweight.
我頭快禿了,又太胖
And I was, like,
"Go fuck yourself."
我就說"去你媽的"
I swallowed a bug.
我什麼都沒說
Hi.
- You're an idiot.
- What?
你是個白痴
什麼
You're an idiot. I've been sitting
over there for 45 minutes...
你是個白痴
我坐在那邊45分鐘
等你過來跟我講話
waiting for you
to come and talk to me.
但我累了,我得回家了
But I'm tired now,
and I have to go home.
I couldn't sit there anymore
waiting for you.
我不能再坐著等你

- Skylar.
我是威爾

- Skylar.
- Oh, and by the way,
對了,那個人
that guy over there-

邁可波頓二號
He wasn't sitting with us,
so to speak.
跟我們不是一國的
- I know. I kinda got that impression.
- Good. Okay.
我知道,我看得出來
好,我得走了
Well, I've got to go.
Gotta get up early and waste some more
money on my overpriced education.
我要早起花錢買文憑
我不是指妳
- No, I didn't mean you.
- That's all right.
沒關係,這是我的電話
There's my number. Maybe we can
go out for coffee sometime.
也許有空可以喝杯咖啡
All right, yeah. Maybe we can just get
together and eat a bunch of caramels.
好,或許聚在一起吃焦糖
- What do you mean?
- When you think about it,
什麼意思?
那和喝咖啡一樣愜意
- it's as arbitrary as drinkin' coffee.
- Oh. Yeah. Okay.
是嗎?好吧
Uh, right, then.
Oh, come on. You're kidding.
Yo!
兄弟
去你的
- Fuck you, bitch!
- Fuck you.
我才去你的
- There goes them fuckin' barneys right now with his skiin' trip.
- Hold on.
那些傻屌在那邊
等等

that old bitch's ass.
我們應該扁那個混蛋
Do you like apples?
你喜歡青蘋果甜甜圈嗎?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
喜歡
我得到她的電話
Well, I got her number!
How do you like them apples?
你卻只能吃甜甜圈

There is a lengthy legal precedent,
Your Honor, going back to 1789,
法官先生
這溯及1789年的司法判例
whereby a defendant can claim self-defense
against an agent of the government...
被告可對政府單位要求自衛權
if that act is deemed a defense against
tyranny, a defense of liberty.
如果該舉動是為保護自由
抗拒暴政制裁的話
Your Honor, Henry Ward Beecher,
- in Proverbs from the Plymouth
Pulpit, 1887, said, quote- - 1887?
1887年比徹爾說過
1887?現在20世紀了
- Excuse me.
- This is the 20th century.
法官先生,他在嘲弄法庭
- He's gonna make a mockery.
- I am afforded the right to speak in my own defense, sir,
憲法賦與我為自己辯護之權
by the Constitution
of the United States.
這是保障我自由的同一份文獻
- Don't tell me about the Constitution.
- This guarantees my liberty.
自由是一個人呼吸的權利
"Liberty," in case you've forgotten,
is a soul's right to breathe.
When it cannot take a long breath,
laws are girded too tight.
無法讓人呼吸的法律太嚴肅
- Without liberty, man is a syncope.
- Man is a what?
不自由,人就是"行屍走肉"
什麼?
- Ibid., Your Honor.
- Son, my turn.
出處同前,法官先生
輪到我,我在這坐了十分鐘
I've been sitting here for ten minutes
now lookin' over this rap sheet of yours.
看著你的罪狀,我不敢相信
I just can't believe it.
June '93, assault.

September '93, assault.
Grand theft auto,
February of '94.
偷車,94年2月
Where, apparently, you defended yourself
and had the case thrown out by citing...
你引述"馬與馬車的財產權"
"free property rights
of horse and carriage" from 1798.
並以自我辯護讓此案駁回
Joke. January '95,
impersonating an officer.
95年1月,扮成警察
Mayhem, theft, resisting.
All overturned.
傷害、竊盜、拒捕,全駁回
I'm also aware that you've been
through several foster homes.
我知道你住過幾個寄養家庭
因受虐而從其中三個搬出
The state removed you from three
because of serious physical abuse.
別的法官是關心你
You know, another judge might care,
but you hit a cop. You're going in.
但你打警察,就得坐牢

guy you met at the bar the other night.
我不記得有碰到這樣的人
I don't recall meeting anyone who matches
that description. I think I'd remember.
Oh, all right, you got me. It's the
ugly, obnoxious, toothless loser...
好吧,是那個醜陋無比又沒牙
who got hammered and wouldn't
leave you alone all night.
還整夜纏著妳不放的廢物
Oh, Will! I remember.
威爾?我記起來了
How are you?
I was wondering if you'd call me.
你好,我還在想你會不會打來
我一直在想...
- Yeah, look, I was wondering-
- Yo, what's up, baby?
怎麼樣?寶貝
- Hold on one second.
- What you doing? Want some of my ass?
稍等
怎樣?寶貝,想上我嗎?
- Herve, I remember you from juvi. How you doing?
- What you doing?
赫芙,我記得你
在少年監獄見過,你好嗎?
幹嘛?去你的
Oh, yeah,
sorry about that.
對不起,我在想...
I was wonderin' maybe we could
get together sometime this week.
也許這禮拜可以聚一聚
- Sit out at a cafe. Maybe have some caramels.
- Oh, that sounds wonderful.
坐在咖啡座吃點焦糖
聽起來很棒
- Yeah?
- Yeah, sure. Where are you?
可以嗎?
可以,你在哪裡?
Uh, well, actually,
this is just a shot in the dark,
我站的地方有點糟...
but, uh, there's no chance
that you're pre-law, is there?
妳那兒總不會是看守所吧
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.
坐
謝謝,很高興跟你講話
Nice talking to ya.
What the fuck
do you want?
你他媽的想幹嘛?
I'm Gerald Lambeau.
我是傑洛藍勃
Professor you told
to fuck himself.
你叫他滾蛋的那個教授
Well, what the fuck
do you want?
找我幹嘛?
I've spoken to the judge, and he's agreed
to release you under my supervision.
我跟法官談過
他同意在我監護之下
放你出去
- Really?
- Yeah.
真的?
是的
- Under two conditions.
- What are those?
但有兩個條件
哪兩個?
First condition is that
you meet with me every week.
第一,你每週要跟我碰面
- What for?
- Go over the proof you're working on,
做什麼?
和你討論數學
get into
some more advanced...
看你做些更高級的組合數學
combinatorial mathematics,
finite math.
有限數學
Sounds like a real hoot.
好像很有趣
And the second condition
is that...
第二,你要看心理醫生
that you see a therapist.
I'm responsible to submit reports
on those meetings.
由我每週負責作評估報告
If you fail to meet with any of those
conditions, you will have to serve time.
如果你不及格
照樣送你回來坐牢
All right. I'll do the math, but I'm not
gonna meet with any fuckin' therapist.
好,數學我接受
但我不看去他的心理醫生
It's better than spending
that time in jail, isn't it?
這總比蹲牢房好,不是嗎?
I read your book, and "Mike"
was havin' the same problems...
我看過你的書
你提到有個病人麥克的問題
that "Chad," the stockbroker,
was havin'.
事實上和證券營業員查克一樣
Absolutely right. Right on the button.
Good for you, Will.
說得很準,很好,非常好
- Very nice.
- Thank you.
謝謝
Will, the pressures-
and I'm not judging them.
威爾,有關壓力...
I'm not labeling them,
我不是武斷地貼你標籤
但它破壞了你的潛力
but they are destroying
your potential.
No more shenanigans.
No more tomfoolery. No more ballyhoo.
別再惡作劇、耍蠢、吹擂
You're right.
God, I know.
你說得對
天哪,我知道
You're not gonna get off that easily.
Come on, Will. A bit more.
要擺脫不容易,來,多講點
- Well, I mean, I do do things, you
know? - What- What kind of things?
我有做過一些事
哪種事?
我做過...你知道...我躲避人群
I do things that, you know,
I mean, I hide from people.
- You hide, do you? - No, no. I
mean, I like- I go places. I interact.
你躲避?
不,我也去一些地方交朋友
- Really? What sort of places?
- Just certain clubs.
真的?哪種地方
一些酒吧
More. That's nice. Yes.
What sort of clubs?
再來,很好,哪種酒吧?
Like, uh, like Fantasy.
像是"幻想"
還不錯的地方
Fantasy. That's nice.
A bit more.
好,多講點
一進去整個人就被音樂包圍
It's something like when you get
in there, the music, like, owns you.
It's like that house music. It's like-
# Bom, bom, bom #
浩勢音樂,砰...
# Bom-bom-bom
Boom, boom, boom, boom #
- You know, you start dancin'.
- Boom, boom, boom. Yeah.
你就會開始跳舞
是的
It's just...
Yes.
Do you find it hard to hide
the fact that you're gay?
隱瞞你是同性戀很難嗎?
What are you talking about? What?
你在說什麼?
Look, buddy, two seconds ago,
you were ready to give me a jump.
兄弟
兩秒前你準備撲向我
A jump? Are you...
撲?你
很抱歉讓你失望了,威爾
I'm terribly sorry
to disappoint you.
Hey, I don't have a problem with it.
I don't care if you putt from the rough.
沒關係,我不在乎你從後面上
What are you- P- Putting from the rough?
What on earth are you talking about?
從後面上你?你在講什麼?
A difficult theorem
could be like a symphony.
困難的定理就像性感的交響曲
It's very erotic.
You go somewhere else.
I can't handle this.
你找別人,我應付不來
- Wow.
- Thank you, Henry.
亨利
- Ah, Henry.
- Hi, Gerry.
我不能再做這種公眾服務
You know something?
I can't do this pro bono work anymore.
不值得
- It's just not- It's not worth it.
- What happened?
怎麼了?
Well, I'm going on national
television next week.
我要上電視,沒空告訴你
I mean, I haven't got time to tell you, much
less talk to that raving looney in there.
更別提這個胡言亂語的瘋子
An absolute lunatic,
he is.
Henry.
亨利
好,你在你床上
Okay,
you are in your bed, Will.
Now, how old are you?
你幾歲?
Seven.
七歲
What do you see?
你看到什麼?
Something's in my room.
我房裡有東西
是什麼?
What is it?
It's like a- It's a figure.
It's hoverin' over me.
是個人形,在我頭上盤旋
You are in a safe place,
Will.
你在安全的地方,威爾
It's t-
It's touchin' me.
下面,他在摸我
Where is it touching you?
他摸你哪裡?
It's touching me
down there,
摸我那下面
and I'm nervous.
我很緊張
You don't have to be
nervous, Will.
不必緊張
We start dancin' and dancin'.
我們開始跳舞,好美
It's just beautiful,
'cause we can make...
因為日落前可以做愛
a lot of love
before the sun goes down.
# Skyrockets
in flight #
"煙火飛舞,午後歡樂"
# Afternoon delight #
- # Hey, hey, hey, afternoon delight #
- Jesus.
"午後歡樂,煙火飛舞"
# Skyrockets in flight
Da-da-da-da #
抱歉
- I'm sorry, Rich.
- I have better things to do with my time.
來,瑞克,我們跳舞
我有更重要的事情要做
# Hey, hey, afternoon delight #
Come on! One dance!
一支舞就好了嘛
You really hypnotized me,
you know?
你把我催眠了
看在老天份上,威爾
- For God's sake, Will.
- What? Oh, come on. He left. You can't pin that on me.
幹嘛?他走了不能怪我
- I told you to cooperate with these people.
- Look...
你得跟這些人合作
看著我的眼睛
- into my eyes.
- Get out, Will.
出去
I don't need therapy.
我不需要治療
夠了,出去
That's enough. Get out!
- I called Mel Weintraub this
morning to see- - Oh, what's the use?
我早上打過電話給梅爾
有用嗎?
What do you want to do?
你想怎麼做?
- Well, there's someone.
- Who is he?
有個人
是誰?
He used to be my, uh-
my roommate in college.
他是我大學室友
(邦克山社區大學)
Trust. Very important
in a relationship.
信任
It's also very important
in a clinical situation.
在感情上和臨床上都很重要
Why is trust
the most important thing...
為何信任對於突破患者心防...
是最重要的關鍵?
in making a breakthrough
with a client?
Maureen, stop the oral fixation
for a moment and join us.
莫琳,別老張著嘴,聽課
- Vinnie.
- Um...
維尼
因為信任就是生命
Because, uh...
Trust is, uh-
Trust is life.
Wow. That's very deep.
Thank you, Vinnie.
很深奧,謝謝你
Next time,
get the notes from your brother.
你抄你弟弟的筆記嗎?
沒有
If a patient doesn't feel safe enough trust
you, then they won't be honest with you.
若病患不信任你
就不會坦誠相對
Then there's really no point
for them being in therapy.
治療對他們來說就毫無意義
I mean, hey, if they don't trust you, you're
never gonna get them to sleep with you.
不信任你就不會跟你上床
那該是心理醫生的最終目的
That should be the goal of any good
therapist. Nail 'em while they're vulnerable.
趁脆弱時下手,我的座右銘
That's my motto.
很好,大家都醒了,歡迎回來
Oh, good, everyone's back.
Welcome back, everybody.
- Hello, Sean.

誰知道什麼是菲爾德獎章?
It's a really big deal.
It's like the Nobel prize for math.
了不起,數學界的諾貝爾獎
Except they only give it out once
every four years. It's a great thing.
只是它四年才頒一次
很偉大,是驚人的榮耀
It's an amazing honor.
Okay, everybody, that's it for today.

我行程很滿,我很忙
This-This boy is incredible.
I've never seen anything like him.
這孩子不可思議、前所未見
What makes him
so incredible, Gerry?
是什麼讓他這麼不可思議?

聽過拉瑪努強嗎?
聽過...沒有
It's a man. He lived
over 100 years ago. He was Indian.
他是個男人
活在一百多年前,印度人
- Dots, not feathers.
- Not feathers. Yeah.
卓越成就
He lived in this tiny hut
somewhere in India.
他住在茅屋裡,沒受過教育
He had no formal education.
無法取得任何科學著述
- He had no access to any scientific work.
- Coffee?
- You, sir?
- Just a little.
But he came across
this old math book,
但他偶然發現一本舊數學課本
and from the simple text,
he was able to extrapolate theories...
卻發明難倒數學家已久的理論
that had baffled
mathematicians for years.
Yes. Continued fractions.
He wrote, uh...
對,連續分數,他是以...
- Well, he mailed it to Hardy at Cambridge.
- Yeah, Cambridge. Yeah.
他寄給劍橋的哈帝
哈帝即刻瞭解那是天才之作

the brilliance of his work... - Mm-hmm.
and brought him over to England,
and then they worked together for years,
把他帶到英國
然後他們合作多年
creating some of the most
exciting math theory ever done.
創造出令人興奮的數學理論
This-This Ramanujan...
拉瑪努強的天才無與倫比
his-his genius
was unparalleled, Sean.
- Well, this boy's just like that.
- Hmm.
這孩子就像他一樣
- But he's- he's a bit defensive.
- Hmm.
但他有點防禦性
I need someone
who can get through to him.
我需要有人突破他的心防
- Like me?
- Yeah, like you.
像是我
對,就是你
- Why?
- Well, because you have the same kind of background.

讓我猜,拜瑞
亨利
沒找瑞克吧

with him once a week. - Mm-hmm.
請跟他碰面,一週一次就好

if he could find it.
他或許已看過你的書
It's gonna be hard
for him to find.

- Oh, thanks.
我喜歡你這邊的裝潢
謝謝
Do you buy all these books
retail,
這些書都是零買的?
or do you send away for, like, a "shrink kit"
that comes with all these volumes included?
還是派人買的整套心理叢書?
- Do you like books?
- Yeah.
你喜歡看書?
喜歡
- Did you read any of these books?
- I don't know.
這些書你讀過嗎
不知道

大概沒有
What about the ones
on the top shelf? You read those?
頂層那些呢?看過沒?
- Yeah, I read those.
- Good for you. What do you think about 'em?
看過
很好,你有什麼感想?
I'm not here for a fuckin' book report.
They're your books. Why don't you read 'em?
我不是他媽的來做讀書報告
那是你的書,你怎麼不讀
I did. I had to.
我讀過,非讀不可
- Must've taken you a long time.
- Yeah, it did.
一定花了你不少時間
是的
United States of America:
A Complete History, Volume I.
美國通史,第一冊
Jesus. If you wanna read
a real history book,
天哪
read Howard Zinn's
A People's History in the United States.
想看真的歷史應該讀辛恩的書
That book'll fuckin'
knock you on your ass.
那本書會讓你大吃一驚
Better than Chomsky's
Manufacturing Consent?
比瓊姆斯基的書更好嗎?
- Do you think that's a good book?
- You fuckin' people baffle me.
你覺得那是本好書?
我搞不懂你們這些人,他媽的
You spend all your money on these fuckin'
fancy books. You surround yourselves with 'em.
把錢花在不對的書上面
- They're the wrong fuckin' books.
- What are the right fuckin' books, Will?
什麼是他媽的對的書?
- Whatever blows your hair back.
- Yeah. Haven't got much hair left.
讓頭髮豎起來的
我剩的頭髮不多
Hey, you know you'd be better
shoving that cigarette up your ass.
你把菸戒了可能會健康點
- It'd probably be healthier for you.
- Yeah, I know.
我知道,抽菸妨礙我練瑜珈
- It really gets in the way of my yoga.
- You work out, huh?
你運動嗎?
- What, you lift?
- Yeah.
你舉重嗎?
對
- Nautilus?
- No, free weights.
舉重機?
不,啞鈴
真的?
- Oh, really? Free weights, huh?
- Yeah. Yeah, big time.
啞鈴?
- Yeah?
- Just like that.
對,很行
- What do you bench?
- 285. What do you bench?
你舉多少?
285,你呢?
You paint that?
你畫的?
- Yeah. Do you paint?
- Uh-uh.
對,你畫畫嗎?
- Do you sculpt?
- No.
你雕塑嗎?
不
喜歡藝術嗎?
Do you like art?
不
喜歡音樂嗎?
- Do you like music?
- This is a real piece of shit.
真爛
Oh, tell me what
you really think.
告訴我你覺得怎麼樣?
Just the linear and impressionistic mix
makes a very muddled composition.
線條結構複雜混亂
It's also a Winslow Homer rip-off, except
you got whitey rowin' the boat there.
筆法頗有印象派畫風
Well, it's art, Monet.
It wasn't very good.
那倒怪了,我並不想模仿莫內
- That's not really what concerns me though.
- What concerns you?
我在意的不是那個
你在意什麼?
- Just the coloring.
- You know what the real bitch of it is?
色彩
你知道這是以數字畫的嗎?
It's paint-by-number.
Is it color-by-number? Because
the colors are fascinating to me.
以數字上色?至少這色彩讓我著迷
- Aren't they really?
- You bet.
真的?色彩怎樣?
I think you're about one step away
from cuttin' your fuckin' ear off.
我想你差點就要割耳朵了
真的?
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.
沒錯
Think I should move to the south of
France, change my name to "Vincent"?
那我應該搬到法國改名梵谷
- You ever heard the sayin', "any port in a storm"?
- Yeah.
聽過"暴風雨中的港口"嗎?
聽過
也許指的就是你
- Yeah, maybe that means you.
- In what way?
哪方面?
- Maybe you're in the middle of a storm, a big fuckin' storm.
- Yeah, maybe.
也許你正在暴風雨中
The sky's fallin' on your head. The
waves are crashin' over your little boat.
天色昏暗,海浪撞擊小船
槳就要斷了
The oars are about to snap.
You just piss in your pants.
You're cryin' for the harbor.
你嚇壞了,迫切需要港口
So maybe you do
what you gotta do to get out.
這是你成為心理醫生的原因
You know, maybe you became
a psychologist.
Bingo. That's it. Let me do my job now.
You start with me. Come on.
答對了,就是這樣
讓我做事吧,你妨礙我了
- Maybe you married the wrong woman.
- Maybe you should watch your mouth!
也許你娶錯女人
也許你講話該小心點
Watch it right there, chief,
all right?
小心點,好嗎?
Ah.
That's it, isn't it?
沒錯,你娶錯女人了
You married
the wrong woman.
What happened?
What, did she leave you?
發生什麼事?
她拋棄你了?
Was she, you know-
banging some other guy?
她是不是搞上別的男人?
再對我太太無禮就宰了你
If you ever disrespect my wife again,
I will end you.
I will fuckin' end you.
我會他媽的宰了你
Got that, chief?
聽到沒?
Time's up.
時間到了
Yeah.
是的
At ease, gentlemen.
先生女士們..
You okay?
你沒事吧?
Look, I'll understand if you don't
wanna meet with him again.
如果你不再想見他,我了解
Thursday, 4:00.
Make sure the kid's here.
星期四4點,一定要他來
Yeah.
好,謝謝
Thanks.
Well, you look lovely
in those glasses.
妳戴那副眼鏡好可愛
- Thank you very much.

多謝妳
真漂亮
- Yes, I always wanted dark blue eye shadow.

我一直想擦藍色眼影
美極了
Growing up in England, you know,
I went to a very nice school.
我在英國長大,念好學校
You know, it was kind of progressive,
organic, do-it-yourself, private school.
就是那種積極,有組織...
又獨立自主的私立學校
Then Harvard.
Hopefully med school.
然後是很有錢途的哈佛醫學院
You know, I figured out,
by the end,
你知道我發現什麼?
最後我的腦子
會價值25萬美金
my brain's gonna be worth
$250,000.
That sounded horrible,
didn't it?
聽起來很可怕吧
Bring me another mai tai!
再來一杯"邁泰"
Yeah, that's cool. I mean,
I bet your parents were happy to pay.
酷,妳父母一定很樂於付錢
No, I was happy to pay.
I inherited the money.
錯,我自己付,我繼承了遺產
Wow. Is Harvard gettin'
all that money?
那麼錢都給哈佛嗎?
No, Stanford. I'm going there
in June when I graduate.
不,史丹佛,畢業後過去
All right, so you just wanted to use
this sailor and then run away, huh?
所以妳只是想利用這個水手囉
我要先拿你做解剖實驗
I was gonna, you know, experiment on you
for anatomy class first, obviously.
這樣的話,好吧
In that case, that's fine.
- Hey, you wanna see my magic tricks, Skylar?
- Of course.
想看我變魔術嗎?
好啊
All right.
Promise to...
好,保證...
All right.
- This one's for you, Rudolph.
- Wait, wait. You need my wand.
這是給妳的,魯道夫
等等,你需要我的魔杖
All right, give me a hit.
Thank you. All right.
好,敲一下
謝謝,讓這些焦糖消失
I'm gonna make
all these caramels disappear.
You ready?
Ready.
準備好了嗎?
One, two, three.
1、2、3
They're all gone.
全不見了
That was my- It works better
when I have my rabbit.
有兔子會比較成功
Well...
I don't really date,
you know, that much.
我不常約會
How very unfortunate...
I think for me.
真可惜,我...你懂我意思
You know what I mean?
I know you've been thinking about it.
我知道你在想什麼
- Oh, no, I haven't.
- Yes, you have.
- 我沒有
- 我知道你有
真的沒有
- No, I really haven't.
- Yes, you have. You were hoping to get a good night kiss.
你有,你想要睡前一吻
No, you know, I tell ya,
I was hopin' to get a good night laid.
不,我想要睡前一炮
But I'll settle for,
like, a kiss, you know?
我願意勉強接受一吻
- How very noble of you.
- Thank you.
你很高尚
謝謝
- Mm.
- No, I was- I was hopin' for a kiss.
不,我真的想要一吻
Well, why don't we just
get it out of the way now?
何不現在就解決?
- Right now?
- Yeah.
現在?
對,來
Come on.
I think I got
some of your pickle.
我吃到你的酸黃瓜了
You again, huh?
又是你?
Come with me.
跟我來
So what's this?
A Taster's Choice moment between guys?
現在要幹嘛?
這是男人的行家選擇?
This is really nice. You got a thing
for swans? Is this, like, a fetish?
這裡真不錯
你喜歡天鵝?這算戀物癖嗎?
Is it something, like, maybe
we need to devote some time to?
這是需要花點時間的事嗎?
- Thought about what you said to me the other day. About my painting.
- Oh.
我在想你批評我畫的事
Stayed up half the night
thinking about it.
失眠大半夜的思索後
Something occurred to me.
突然我想到一件事
I fell into a deep, peaceful sleep
and haven't thought about you since.
接著就沉沉入睡
- You know what occurred to me?
- No.
你知道我當時想到什麼嗎?
不知道
You're just a kid. You don't have the
faintest idea what you're talking about.
你只是個孩子
你根本不曉得你在說什麼
- Why, thank you.
- It's all right.
謝謝,為什麼?
沒關係,因你沒離開過波士頓
You've never been
out of Boston.
是沒有
Nope.
So if I asked you about art,
you'd probably give me the skinny...
所以問你藝術,你可能會...
提出藝術書籍中的粗淺論調
on every art book
ever written.
Michelangelo?
You know a lot about him.
有關米開朗基羅,你知道很多
Life's work, political aspirations.
Him and the pope.
他的政治抱負,他和教皇...
Sexual orientation.
The whole works, right?
性傾向,所有作品,對嗎?
I bet you can't tell me what it
smells like in the Sistine Chapel.
但你不知道西斯汀教堂的氣味
You never actually stood there
and looked up at that beautiful ceiling.
你從沒站在那兒
觀賞美麗的天花板
Seeing that.
我看過
If I ask you about women,
如果我問關於女人的事
you'll probably give me a syllabus
of your personal favorites.
你八成會說出個人偏好的謬論
You may have even been laid
a few times.
你可能上過幾次床
But you can't tell me what it feels like
to wake up next to a woman...
但你說不出在女人身旁醒來
and feel truly happy.
很幸福的滋味
You're a tough kid.
你是個很倔的孩子
I ask you about war, you'd probably
throw Shakespeare at me, right?
問戰爭,你會說莎士比亞的話
"Once more into the breach,
dear friends."
"共赴戰場,親愛的朋友"
But you've never been near one.
但你從沒接近過戰爭
You've never held your best friend's
head in your lap...
從沒把好友的頭抱在膝蓋上
and watch him gasp his last
breath lookin' to you for help.
看著他吐出最後一口氣
If I asked you about love,
you'd probably quote me a sonnet,
問愛情,你會引述十四行詩
but you've never looked at a woman
and been totally vulnerable.
但你從沒看過女人的脆弱
Known someone that could
level you with her eyes.
她能以雙眼擊倒你
Feelin' like God put
an angel on Earth just for you,
感覺上帝讓天使為你下凡
who could rescue you
from the depths of hell.
她能從地獄救出你
And you wouldn't know
what it's like to be her angel,
你不了解當她天使的滋味
to have that love for her
be there forever.
擁有對她的愛,直到永遠
Through anything.
Through cancer.
經歷這一切,經歷癌症
And you wouldn't know about sleepin'
sittin' up in a hospital room...
你無法體會在醫院睡兩個月
for two months,
holding her hand,
because the doctors
could see in your eyes...
因為醫生一看到你就知道
that the terms "visiting hours"
don't apply to you.
會客時間的規定對你無效
You don't know about real loss,
你不了解真正的失去
'cause that only occurs when you love
something more than you love yourself.
唯有愛別人勝於自己才能體會
I doubt you've ever dared
to love anybody that much.

I look at you. I don't see
an intelligent, confident man.
看著你,我沒看到聰明自信
I see a cocky,
scared shitless kid.
我看到被嚇傻的狂妄孩子
But you're a genius, Will.
No one denies that.
但你是天才,沒人能否認
No one could possibly understand
the depths of you.
沒人能了解你的深度
But you presume to know everything about
me because you saw a painting of mine.
但你看我的畫就認定了解我
你把我的人生撕裂了
You ripped
my fuckin' life apart.
You're an orphan, right?
你是孤兒,對吧?
Do you think I'd know the first thing
about how hard your life has been...
你想我會知道你日子有多苦
how you feel, who you are...
你的感受,你是誰
because I read Oliver Twist?
是因為我看過孤雛淚嗎?
Does that encapsulate you?
太簡化你了嗎?
Personally, I don't give a shit
about all that, because...
我不在乎,因為你知道嗎?
You know what? I can't
learn anything from you...
我不能靠任何書籍認識你
I can't read
in some fuckin' book.
Unless you wanna talk
about you,
除非你想談自己,談你是誰
who you are.
And I'm fascinated.
I'm in.
那我就著迷了,我願意加入
But you don't wanna do that,
do you, sport?
但你不想那麼做,對嗎?
You're terrified
of what you might say.
你怕你會被說出來的話嚇到
Your move, chief.
輪到你說了,大哥
Hello? Hello?
喂?喂?
Hello?
Professor Valenti,
are you calling me again?
瓦蘭帝教授,又是你嗎?
Freak.
怪胎
- Oh, God.
- Christ, who did you call?
天哪,你打給誰?
- No one. I forgot the number.
- You fuckin' retarded?
沒有,我忘了號碼
你他媽智障
You went all the way out there in the
rain, and you didn't bring the number.
冒雨打電話,竟忘了號碼
No, it was your mother's 900 number.
I just ran out of quarters.
那是你媽的免費電話
別扯上我媽,我剛上過你媽

I just got off yours.
- That's
pretty funny, Morgan.
很好笑,摩根,太炫了
That's a fuckin' nickel,
bitch.
- Keep antagonizing me. Watch what happens.
- All right, then, Morgan.
繼續跟我作對看看
看看會怎樣...

You were in there for an hour.
什麼叫沒講話?一個鐘頭
He just sat there counting the seconds
until the session was over.
他就坐著等會談結束
- Pretty impressive, actually.
- Why would he do that?
讓人印象蠻深刻的
他為什麼要那麼做?
To prove to me he doesn't have
to talk to me if he doesn't want to.
證明他不想講就不必講
What is this? Some kind of staring contest
between two kids from the old neighborhood?
這是小孩玩的瞪人比賽嗎?
Yeah, it is,
and I can't talk first.
對,而且我不能先講話
We know your theory, Alexander, but the
boy's found a simple geometrical picture.
我們知道你的理論,亞歷山大
但這孩子找出簡單的幾何圖
樹狀結構行不通
- A tree structure won't work.
- Look now. He's joining the two vertices.
他把兩個頂點連起來了
But I can do the sum.
但我算出總數
- It's how you group the terms, Alexander.
- But, Gerry.
那是集合項的方法
但是如果這樣做...
If we do the whole thing
this way, then...
Hey, look, look.
我寫下來了,這樣比較簡單
I wrote it down.
It's simpler this way.
Sometimes
people get lucky.
有些人就是走運
You're a brilliant man.
你是很聰明的人
You know,
I was on this plane once,
我有一次搭飛機,坐在機上
and I'm sittin' there, and...
the captain gets on,
he does his whole, you know,
機長廣播完飛行於三萬五千呎
"we'll be cruisin' at 35,000 feet,"
but then he puts the mike down.
他放下麥克風後忘了關掉
- He forgets to turn it off.
- Mm-hmm.
他轉向副駕駛說
So he turns to the copilot.
He's, like,
"You know, all I could use right now is
a fuckin' blow job and a cup of coffee."
我現在很想要口交和咖啡
So the stewardess fuckin' goes bombin'
up from the back of the plane...
空服員衝去跟他說麥克風沒關
to tell him
the microphone's still on.
This guy in the back of the plane's
like, "Hey, hon, don't forget the coffee."
機尾有個人說"別忘了咖啡"
You ever been on a plane?
你搭過飛機?
No, but it's a fuckin' joke. It works
better if I tell it in the first person.
沒有,那只是個笑話
用第一人稱比較好笑
Yeah, it does.
沒錯
I have been laid,
you know?
我做過愛
Really? Good for you.
真的?很好
- Big time, big time.
- Big time, huh?
我很厲害
I went on a date last week.
很厲害?
對,我上禮拜有約會
- How'd it go?
- It was good.
怎麼樣?
很好
- Goin' out again?
- I don't know.
要再約會嗎?
不知道
- Why?
- Haven't called her.
為什麼?
我沒打給她
- Christ, you're an amateur.
- I know what I'm doin'.
天哪,你真沒用
- 我知道我在幹嘛
- 真的嗎?
Yeah. Don't worry about me.
I know what I'm doin'.
放心,我知道我在幹嘛
Yeah, but this girl was, like,
you know, beautiful.
這女孩很漂亮,聰明風趣
She's smart. She's fun. She's different
from most of the girls I've been with.
她跟我以前認識的女生不一樣
- So call her up, Romeo.
- Why, so I can realize she's not that smart.
那就打給她,羅密歐
讓自己發現她沒那麼聰明嗎?
很無聊嗎?
That she's fuckin' boring?
You know, I mean, you don't...
這女孩現在很完美
This girl's, like, fuckin' perfect
right now. I don't wanna ruin that.
我不想破壞
Maybe you're perfect right now.
Maybe you don't wanna ruin that.
或許是你不想破壞你的完美
But I think that's
a super philosophy, Will.
我覺得那是極好的哲學
That way, you can go through your entire life
without ever having to really know anybody.
這樣可以一輩子不認識任何人
My wife used to fart
when she was nervous.
我太太一緊張就放屁
She had all sorts
of wonderful idiosyncrasies.
她有各種奇妙的小特質
你知道,她睡覺會放屁
You know, she used to fart
in her sleep.
Just thought I'd share that
with you.
抱歉跟你講這種事
One night it was so loud,
it woke the dog up.
有天晚上大聲到把狗吵醒
She woke up and gone, like,
"Was that you?"
她醒來說"是你嗎",我說是
I said, "Yeah." I didn't have
the heart to tell her. Oh, God.
我不忍心告訴她,天哪
- She woke herself up?
- Yes.
她把自己臭醒?
是的
Oh, Christ. But, Will, she's been dead
two years and that's the shit I remember.
天哪,她去世兩年了
而那是我記得的事
It's wonderful stuff, you know?
Little things like that.
像那樣的小事很奇妙
Yeah, but those are the things
I miss the most.
那是我最想念的事
Those little idiosyncrasies
that only I knew about.
這些小特質讓她成為我太太
That's what made her
my wife.
Boy, and she had the goods on me too.
She knew all my little peccadillos.
她也知道我所有的小瑕疵
People call these things
"imperfections," but they're not.
人們稱之為不完美
其實不然,那才是好東西
That's the good stuff.
And then we get to choose who
we let into our weird little worlds.
能選擇讓誰進入我們的世界
You're not perfect, sport.
你並不完美,我不吊你胃口
And let me save you
the suspense.
This girl you met,
she isn't perfect either.
你認識的女生也不完美
But the question is whether or not
you're perfect for each other.
問題是你們是否完美地合適
That's the whole deal.
That's what intimacy is all about.
親密關係就是這麼回事
Now you can know
everything in the world, sport,
你可以知道全世界的事
but the only way you're findin' out
that one is by givin' it a shot.
但發掘的方法就是去嘗試
You certainly won't learn
from an old fucker like me.
你不能跟我這個糟老頭學
Even if I did know,
I wouldn't tell a pissant like you.
就算我知道我也不告訴你
Yeah, why not?
為什麼?
You told me every other
fuckin' thing. Jesus Christ.
你其他事都告訴我了,天哪
Fuckin' talk more than any shrink
I ever seen in my life.
你的話比任何心理醫生都多
I teach the shit.
I didn't say I knew how to do it.
我只是教心理學
我說過我不是心理醫生
Yeah.
You ever think
about gettin' remarried?
那麼,你想過再婚嗎?
My wife's dead.
我太太死了
- Hence the word "remarried."
- She's dead.
所以才叫"再婚"
她死了
Yeah, well, I think
that's a super philosophy, Sean.
我想那是極好的哲學
I mean, that way, you can actually
go through the rest of your life...
這樣可以一輩子不認識任何人
without ever really knowing
anybody.
Time's up.
時間到了
- Hold it open.
- Okay.
別關
Thanks.
謝謝

# I know I'm about

Oh, I hope it was someone with the
open-toed sandals and the really bad breath.
希望是個穿拖鞋
又有口臭的人

surgery tomorrow, are you?
妳不會明天就要開刀吧
- No.
- Let's go.
不是
走吧

我的天,我的狗贏了

我們贏了
牠大贏

around here then?
你在這邊長大的嗎?

不遠,南波士頓
Still glowing from my win.
贏了比賽讓我臉好熱
Look at you.

你的生活會怎樣

better off without her?

我沒那意思
沒關係,很重要的問題
'Cause you'll have bad times,
but that'll always wake you up...
是會有不好的時候

you weren't paying attention to.

October 21, 1975.
1975年10月21日
Jesus Christ.
You know the fuckin' day?
天哪,你他媽的記得日期
Oh, yeah, 'cause it was game six of the
World Series, biggest game in Red Sox history.
對,那是世界大賽第六場
紅襪隊史上最重大的球賽
- Yeah, sure.

沒錯
我和朋友睡人行道排隊買票
- You got tickets?
- Yep. Day of the game I was sittin' in a bar,
你有票?
對,比賽當天
我們坐在酒吧等球賽開始
waitin' for the game to start
and in walks this girl.
有個女孩走進來...
It was an amazing game though. You know,
bottom of the eighth, Carbo ties it up.
那是場很棒的球賽
八局下半六比六平手
It was 6-6.
It went to 12.
打到第十二局,下半場時
Bottom of the 12th, in stepped
Carlton Fisk, old Pudge.
矮冬瓜菲克斯上場
Steps up to the plate.
You know, he's got that weird stance.
他站上本壘,姿勢很怪
- Yeah, yeah. - And then-
Boom! He clocks it, you know.
打擊出去,左外野高飛球
High fly ball
down the left field line!
Thirty-five thousand people
on their feet, yellin' at the ball.
三萬五千人站起來對球吼
But that's nothin', 'cause Fisk,
he's wavin' at the ball like a madman.
菲斯克像發了瘋似地揮手說
- Yeah, I've seen that.
- "Get over! Get over!
"飛過去...",結果球飛到邊界
- Right.
- Get over!"
Then it hits the foul pole.
He goes ape-shit, and 35,000 fans...
三萬五千名球迷衝到場上
They charge the field,
you know.
Yeah, and he's fuckin'
blowin' people outta the way.

Get outta the way!"
I can't fuckin' believe you had
tickets to that fuckin' game!
我真不敢相信你有票
你有衝到場上嗎?
- Did you rush the field?

我沒衝到場上,我不在場
什麼?
- What?
- No, I was in a bar, havin' a drink with my future wife.
我跟我未來的老婆在喝酒
You missed Pudge Fisk's home run to have a
fuckin' drink with some lady you never met?
你錯過菲斯克的全壘打?
對
跟一個不認識的女人喝酒?
Yeah, but you should have
seen her. She was a stunner.
對,你該看看她,令人驚豔
- I don't care if-
- Oh, no, no, she lit up the room.
我才不管他媽的...
她讓整個屋子亮起來
- I don't care if Helen of Troy walks into the room.
- Oh, Helen of Troy!
西施走進來我也不在乎
天哪,你朋友就這麼放過你?
That's game six! Oh, my God,
and who were these friends of yours?
- They let you get away with that?
- They had to.
他們沒辦法
- What did you say to 'em?
- I just slid my ticket across the table.
你跟他們怎麼說?
我把票滑過去說
I said, "Sorry, guys.
I gotta see about a girl."
抱歉,我要去找一個女孩

我要去找一個女孩?
That's what you said?
They let you get away with that?
你那麼說?
沒辦法
他們就放過你了?
Oh, yeah. They saw it
in my eyes that I meant it.
對,他們看到我認真的眼睛
- You're kiddin' me?
- No, I'm not kidding you, Will.
你騙我
我沒騙你
That's why I'm not talkin' right now about
some girl I saw at a bar 20 years ago...
所以我現在不會因為...
and how I always regretted
not goin' over and talkin' to her.
當年沒和她說話而懊悔終生
I don't regret the 18 years
I was married to Nancy.
我不後悔跟南茜結褵的18年
I don't regret the six years I had
to give up counseling when she got sick,
不後悔為她的病放棄輔導
and I don't regret the last years
when she got really sick.
不後悔那最後幾年
守著重病的她
And I sure as hell don't
regret missin' a damn game.
更不會後悔錯過球賽
That's regret.
只是有點遺憾
Wow!
Would have been nice
to catch that game though.
看到那場球賽還是不錯的
I didn't know Pudge
was gonna hit a home run.
我不曉得矮冬瓜會紅不讓
You know, I'm very, very
useful on the court.
我在球場上很有用,我很高
I'm extremely tall.
- You're not that tall.
- I dunk.
妳沒那麼高
我會灌籃
Will I ever play in the N.B.A.?
我能打NBA嗎?
"It is decidedly so."
Hmph.
絕對可以
Why do we always stay here?
為什麼老是待在這邊?
'Cause it's nicer
than my place.
因為比我家好
Yes, but I've never
seen your place.
但我從沒去過你家
I know.
我知道
When am I gonna meet
your friends and your brothers?
我幾時見到你朋友和哥哥?
Well, they don't really
come down here that much.
他們不常來這裡
I think I can make it
to South Boston.
我可以到南波士頓
It's kind of a hike.
有點遠
是我還是他們見不得人?
Is it me you're hiding from them
or the other way around?
- All right, we'll go.
- When?
好,我們去
幾時?
I don't know.
We'll go sometime next week.
不知道,下禮拜吧
What if I said I would not sleep with you
again until you let me meet your friends?
如不讓我見他們
就再也不跟你上床
I'd say it's, like, 4:30 in the mornin'.
They're probably up.
清晨四點半,他們應該醒了
Oh, my God.
Men are shameless.
天哪,男人真無恥
If you're not thinking with your wiener,
then you're acting directly on its behalf.
你們男人就只會用小弟弟思考
僅代表我的小弟弟向你預支
You bet. And on behalf of my wiener,
can I get an advance payment?
I don't know. Let's ask.
"Outlook does not look good."
不知道,我問問
前途無量
- What? - Fuck the- Hey, Chuck.
No. Nothing. Go back to sleep.
什麼?幹
查克,沒事,繼續睡
妳去打NBA才前途無量
"Outlook"? That's the same thing that
told you you was gonna play in the N.B.A.
Exactly, so look out. You'd better
start buying some season tickets.
沒錯,所以你最好開始買季票
Mmm! I plan to. I'm tall.
I like wearing shorts.
我很高,我喜歡穿短褲
Hook, hook. Dunk, dunk.
勾射,灌籃
- You're not that tall.
- Yes, I am.
妳沒那麼高
我有,我三分射籃很行
Maybe I'm all
about three points.
I'm all about home runs.
我就很會打"全壘打"
Stop mixing your
sporting metaphors.
別用運動術語影射
A leprechaun's got his dick
in the monkey's ass.
妖精的老二在猴子屁眼裡
Morgan comes runnin' in, goin',
"I don't mind it. I don't mind-"
摩根跑出來說我不介意
Well, I can't believe you brought Skylar here
when we're fuckin' all bombed and drinkin'.
幹,你竟挑我們爛醉時帶她來
I know, Morgan. It's a real rarity
we'd be all drinkin'.
我們很難得一起喝酒
我叔叔馬帝只要一喝酒
就會狂歡個一年半載
My uncle Marty drinks. He'll go
on a bender for six, eight months.
Did I ever tell ya what happened to him when
he was drivin' up there and got pulled over?
我講過他被攔下來的事沒?
- I told you guys, right?
- Marty, yeah.
我跟你們講,你們應該知道
Let me tell ya what happened to my uncle
Marty, because you oughta know this.
到這邊老是聽他講故事
He's always tellin' stories. Every time
we come here he's got another story.
這個我們早就聽過了
But we all heard this one.
Go ahead. Say it anyway.
還是說吧,快講
I will go ahead. Thanks a lot.
Guess I have the floor now.
我會講,多謝,換我發言
My uncle Marty's
drivin' home, right?
我叔叔開車回家撞到樹
Bombed out of his tree, right? Just
hammered out of his gourd. Just wrecked.
他醉得一塌糊塗
This state trooper sees him, pulls him
over. So my uncle's fucked basically.
州警把他攔下來,我叔叔慘了
Got him out of the car,
tryin' to make him walk the line.
州警要他下車走直線
He gets out of the car, pukes, and the
statie's pretty sure he's over the legal limit.
結果他吐在州警身上
州警確信他超過酒精濃度
So he's about to throw the cuffs
on him and put him in jail.
正要把他戴上手銬送去坐牢
All of a sudden, 50 yards down the road,
there's this huge fuckin' boom.
突然五十碼外一聲他媽的巨響
- Statie gets real spooked.
He turns around- - He got shot?
州警嚇一大跳,轉身
槍聲?
No. So- So- You
heard this story before.
不,是...
你聽過這故事了
Yeah, Morgan, stop.
Stop.
Some other guy's car had hit a tree.
There was an accident.
是別人的車撞到樹,出事了
Anyway...
- How could he hear-
- Shut the fuck up!
總之...閉嘴
- You're drivin' him nuts.
- I'm gonna break your neck. Shut up!
我要扭斷你脖子
閉嘴
He told you the story
once before.
他跟你說過這故事了
So he tells my uncle,
"Stay here. Don't move."
州警跟我叔叔說"別走"
Statie goes runnin' down the road
to deal with the other accident.
就跑去處理另一起事故
After a few minutes of just
Iyin' in his own piss and vomit,
躺在尿和嘔吐物中幾分鐘後
my uncle starts wonderin'
what he's doin' there.
我叔叔才想到,他在那兒幹嘛
Gets up, gets in his car
and just drives home.
於是站起來開車回家
The next mornin'
my uncle's just passed out.
隔天早上我叔叔還昏迷不醒
He hears this knockin' at the door.
他聽到敲門聲
So he goes downstairs,
pulls the door open- "What?"
下樓拉開門說"什麼事"
是攔下他的州警
It's the state trooper
that pulled him over.
Statie says,
"Fuck you mean, 'What?'
州警說"我操,你明知故問"
You know what. I pulled you over
last night is what, and you took off."
"我昨晚攔下你,你逃走了"
He's like, "I never
seen you before in my life.
叔叔說"我這輩子沒見過你"
I've been home all night with my kids.
I don't know who the fuck you are."
"我整晚在家,你亂講什麼"
He's like, "You know who I am.
Let me get in your garage."
州警說"別裝蒜了,到車庫"
My uncle's like, "What?" He said, "You
heard me. Let me get in your garage."
我叔叔說"什麼?"
州警說"帶我去你的車庫"
He was like, "All right. Fine." Takes
him out to the garage, opens the door.
我叔叔帶他到車庫打開門
And there's- The statie's police
cruiser is in my uncle's garage.
警車就在我叔叔的車庫裡
He was so fuckin'...
他醉到他媽的開錯車回家了
He was so fuckin' hammered
he drove the wrong car home.
The best part about it is,
the fuckin' state trooper...
最屌的是州警好糗
was so embarrassed
he didn't do anything.
他整晚什麼都沒做
He'd been drivin' around all night in my
uncle's Chevelle, lookin' for the house.
開著我叔叔的車挨家挨戶找人
All right, Chuck, what the fuck
is the point of your story?
你的故事重點是什麼?
He got away.
That's the point.
他逃跑了就是重點
- Well, question-
- Come on. Stop.
- 好,問題是...
- 你是不是...
少來了
- I'm tryin' to clarify somethin'.
- You're embarrassing him.
你想弄清楚又不好意思問
- 好了,你別糗人家了
- 因為你講的故事沒什麼道理
- It doesn't make any sense.
- It does make sense,
if you listen to the story
and quit askin' questions.
聽故事別問東問西的
Well, let's see if you can get this one.
I've got a little story for you.
摩根,看這個故事你懂不懂
All right, there's an old couple
in bed, Mary and Paddie.
好,一對老夫妻在床上
瑪麗和派帝
They wake up on the morning
of their 50th anniversary.
結婚50週年那天他們醒來
Mary looks over and
gazes adoringly at Paddie.
瑪麗深情地望著派帝說
She's like,
"Oh, Jesus, Paddie.
天哪,你真是一個大帥哥
You're such a good-looking
feller. I love ya.
我愛你,我要送你一件禮物
I want to give ya
a little present.
Anything your little heart desires,
I'm goin' to give it to ya.
你渴望什麼我都給你
What would ya like?
你想要什麼?
Paddie's like, "Oh, gee, Mary.
That's a very sweet offer.
派帝說這真是甜蜜的提議
Now, in 50 years, there's one thing
that's been missing,
五十年來就少一樣東西
and, uh, I would like you
to give me a blow job.
我希望妳幫我吹喇叭,我想要
I would like for it."
Mary's like, "All right."
瑪麗說好
She takes her teeth out, puts 'em in
the glass. She gives him a blow job.
她把假牙拿掉
放進杯子裡,然後幫他吹
Afterwards, Paddie's like, "Yeah, geez,
now that's what I've been missin'.
之後派帝說,這就是我最渴望
That was the most beautiful,
earth-shattering thing ever!
最勾魂攝魄的事,他說
Beautiful, Mary!
I love ya!
太棒了,瑪麗,我愛妳
Is there anything
that I can do for you?"
我能為妳做什麼嗎?
Mary looks up to him and she goes,
"Give us a kiss."
瑪麗抬頭看他說,"親一下"
- Oh!
- Oh, my God!
我的天
- That's filthy.
- It's not that filthy. I've heard filthy.
好噁
不噁,我聽過更噁心的
- Get off of me!
- All right. See you guys later.
滾開,操你媽...
好,再見
All right.
Take it easy, Bill.
保重,比利
So, Skylar,
thanks for comin' by.
謝謝妳改變我對哈佛人的看法
Changed my opinion
of Harvard people.
You don't want to rush to judgment on
that one, 'cause they're not all like me.
別驟下斷語,他們跟我不同
Oh. I'm sure.
It was nice to meet ya.
我相信,很高興認識妳
- Oh.
- Take it easy. Slowly back away.
小心
- Oh, come on. Brother.
- I don't know what you're doin', dude.
慢慢讓開
你在幹嘛?你要送我們
- You're givin' us a ride.
- What the fuck do I look like to you?
你以為我在幹嘛?
- Come on, Chuck.
- You're walkin', bitch. Will's takin' the car.
你要走路,車給威爾
All right, thanks, sucker.
I appreciate it.
好,謝了,很感激
I don't know what you're
gettin' all serious about.
幹嘛這麼正經
- You're droppin' me off first.
- It's really out of the way.
你還是要先送我回家
這樣很不順路
Oh, okay. Just 'cause you don't have to
sleep in your one-room palace tonight...
別以為今晚可以外宿
don't start
thinkin' you're bad.
就屌成這樣
Hey, wait a minute. You said
we were gonna see your place.
等一下,你說要去看你家
- Not tonight.
- Oh, no, not tonight. Not any other night.
今晚不行
今晚不行,哪一晚都不行

and goes haulin' ass down the aisle.
空服員聽到就往走道上衝
I yell,
"Don't forget the coffee."
我說"別忘了咖啡"
No shit!
You didn't say that.
狗屁,你沒那麼說
For Christ's sake, Marty,
it's a joke.
拜託,那是笑話嘛
- I know someone that actually happened to, Marty.
- A joke.
我認識真的碰到這事的人
- Gerry.
- Hi.
只是個笑話
傑洛
- Have trouble findin' the place?
- No, I took a cab.
這邊很難找嗎?
不會,我搭計程車
Timmy, this is Gerry.
We went to college together.
提米,這是傑洛,大學同學
How you doin'?
Nice to meet ya.
你好,幸會
- Pleased to meet you.

幸會
請你喝杯啤酒吧
Um, no, just a Perrier.

- It'll cover your sex change operation.
一千兩百萬
我看不夠付
夠付你的變性手術了
- Nuts?
- No, thank you.
堅果?
不,謝謝
So, you wanted
to talk about Will.
你想談威爾
- Well, it seems to be going well.
- I think so.
好像很順利
我想是的
Have you talked to him
at all about his future?
你跟他談過未來沒?
No, we haven't gotten into that yet.
We're still bangin' away at the past.
沒談到,還在往事中打轉
Maybe you should. My phone's been
ringing off the hook with job offers.
該開始談了
許多工作都急著找他
- What kind?
- Cutting edge mathematics, think tanks.
哪種工作?
尖端科技數學、智囊團
The kind of place where a mind
like Will's is given free rein.
威爾的頭腦能發揮的地方
That's great that there are offers, but
I don't really think he's ready for that.
那真好,但他還沒準備好
I'm not sure
you understand, Sean.
我想你不明白
- What don't I understand?
- Here you go, guys.
我不明白什麼?
- Thanks, Tim.
- Yeah, thank you.
來了

- No.
- Thank you, Tim.
沒有
謝謝
- So who won the bet?
- I did.
誰賭贏了
我贏了
This isn't about me, Sean.
這不是我的事
I'm nothing compared
to this young man.
我跟這年輕人比不算什麼
You ever hear of
Gerald Lambeau?
你聽過傑洛藍勃嗎?
In 1905 there were hundreds of professors
renown for their study of the universe.
在1905年
有許多以研究宇宙聞名的教授
But it was a 26-year-old
Swiss patent clerk,
但改變世界的卻是個
doing physics in his spare time,
who changed the world.
趁閒暇時
研究物理的26歲辦事員
Can you imagine if Einstein
would have given that up...
你可以想像如果愛因斯坦...
just to get drunk with his buddies
in Vienna every night.
每天都喝得爛醉的話會怎樣?
We all would have
lost something.
我們都會失去一些東西
Tim would never
have heard of him.
而提米絕不會聽過他
- Pretty dramatic, Gerry.
- No, it isn't, Sean.
非常戲劇化
不是
This boy has that gift.
這孩子有天賦
He just doesn't got the direction,
but we can give that to him.
他只是沒方向,我們該給他
Hey, Gerry, in the 1960s, there was a young
man graduated from University of Michigan.
在60年代曾有一個...
密西根大學畢業的年輕人
Did some brilliant work
in mathematics.
他的數學很出色
Specifically,
bounded harmonic functions.
特別是有界集函數
Then he went on to Berkeley. He was
assistant professor. Showed amazing potential.
他到柏克萊當助教,潛力驚人
Then he moved to Montana, and
he blew the competition away.
然後在蒙大拿州贏得競賽

泰德卡辛斯基
Haven't heard of him.
沒聽過
- Hey, Timmy!
- Yo!
提米
誰是泰德卡辛斯基?
- Who's Ted Kaczynski?
- Unabomber.
郵包炸彈狂
That's exactly
what I'm talking about.
那就是我說的,他需要方向
- We gotta give this kid direction.
- Yeah...
He can contribute to the world,
and we can help him do that.
他能貢獻世人,我們能幫他
Direction's one thing.
Manipulation's another.
方向是一回事,操縱是另一回事
- Sean-
- We have to let him find...
你要讓他自己發掘
尚恩,我不是每晚坐在家裡
I'm not sitting at home every night
twisting my mustache and hatching a plan...
策劃怎麼摧毀他的人生
to ruin this boy's life!
I was doing advanced mathematics
when I was 18,
我18歲就會做高級數學
and it still took me over 20 years to do
something worthy of a Field's medal.
20年後才得到菲爾德獎章
Maybe he doesn't want
what you want.
也許他不想照你的想法去做
There's more to life
than a fuckin' Field's medal.
人生不只是一個他媽的獎章
This is too important, Sean,
and it's above personal rivalry.
這太重要了,要超越個人立場
Wait a minute.
Let's talk about the boy.
等等,我們談的是這孩子
Why don't we give him time
to figure out what he wants?
為何不給他時間想清楚要什麼
That's a wonderful theory, Sean.
It worked wonders for you, didn't it?
很棒的理論,可為你創造奇蹟
Yeah, it did,
you arrogant fuckin' prick!
對,你這自負的混蛋
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry
that I came here today.
我很遺憾
很遺憾我來了,我是出於好意
I came here out of courtesy.
I wanted to keep you in the loop.
Nice to be in the loop.
我想讓你參與這件事
我很高興能夠參與
The boy's in a meeting right now
I set up for him over at McNeil.
他此刻正在我安排的面談中
Well, Will, I'm not exactly sure
what you mean.
威爾,我不清楚你的意思
We've already
offered you a position.
我們已經給你職位了
這年頭做事沒人不拿酬金的
Nobody in this town works
without a retainer, guys.
You think you can find somebody
who does, you have my blessin'.
你們認為找得到,我祝福你們
But I think we all know that person is
not gonna represent you as well as I can.
但沒有人可以像我做得那麼好
Will, our offer
is $84,000 a year.
我們已給你年薪八萬四加福利
Retainer!
Retainer.
酬金
You want us to give you
cash right now?
你是要我們現在給你現金?
Whoa-ho-ho. Easy-
Now, I didn't say that.
慢點,我沒那麼說
Allegedly,
your situation, for you,
但我口袋裡如果有兩百塊
would be concurrently
improved if I had...
你們的處境會同時獲得改善
$200 in my back pocket
right now.
I don't think I can- Larry?
我沒有,賴瑞
- I've got $73.
- Will you take a check?
我有73塊
你收支票嗎?
Let me tell you somethin'.
You're suspect.
你們這種舉止相當可疑
Yeah, you. I don't know
what your reputation is in this town,
對,你們
我不知道你們的聲譽怎樣
but after the shit
you tried to pull today,
但耍這種花招,我一定會調查
you can bet
I'll be lookin' into you.
Now, any business
we have heretofore,
關於我們未來的合作
you can speak with
my aforementioned attorney.
請和我的律師談
Good day, gentlemen.
再見,在那天到來前
And until that day comes,
keep your ear to the grindstone.
拼命幹活吧
- How's it goin'?
- Fine.
怎麼樣?
Yeah.
很好
Good.
好
- Want some help?
- No!
要幫忙嗎?
不要
Come on. Give me one little peek,
and we'll go to the batting cages.
給我看一下,我們要去練球場
No.
我一定要唸這個
It is actually important
that I learn this.
- It's really important... to me, okay?
- All right.
真的很重要
對我而言
- Why don't we just hang out here all day?
- Yes, why don't we?
好吧
那就在這邊待一整天
有何不可
All right, Mr. Nosey Parker.
好,多管閒事先生
Seeing as you're intent
on breaking my balls,
既然你打算煩我
- let me ask you a question.
- All right.
讓我問你一個問題
好
Do you have
a photographic memory?
你有影像記憶力嗎?
I don't know. I just kind of remember. I
mean, how do you remember your phone number?
不知道,我就是記得
好比妳可以記得妳的電話號碼
You just do.
- Have you studied organic chemistry?
- A little bit.
你念過有機化學嗎?
一點點
- Oh, just for fun?
- Yeah, for kicks.
為了好玩?
對,為了找樂趣
Yeah, it's so much fun
studying organic chemistry.
念有機化學會有趣,你瘋啦
Are you mad?
Have you completely
lost your mind?
你精神失常嗎?
Nobody studies it for fun. It's not a
necessity, especially for someone like you.
沒人會為了好玩念化學
它不是必要的
尤其對你這種人而言
- Someone like me?
- Yeah.
我這種人?
時間分配給練球場和酒吧的人
Someone who divides their time, fairly
evenly, between batting cages and bars.
- I would hardly say it was a necessity.
- Oh.
人家不會說那是必要的
You know, there are very
smart people here at Harvard.
哈佛有很聰明的人
Even they have to study,
because this is really hard.
但他們都得用力念才懂
And yet... you do it
so easily. I don't understand.
你卻簡單地做到了,我不懂
我不懂你的大腦怎麼運作
I don't understand
how your mind works.
- Did you play the piano?
- I want to talk about this.
妳彈鋼琴嗎?
別轉移話題
No, I'm trying to explain it to you.
Do you play the piano?
我跟妳解釋嘛,妳會彈嗎?
- Yeah, a bit.
- So when you look at a piano, you see Mozart.
一點點
好,妳看著鋼琴就看到莫札特
- I see "Chopsticks."
- All right, well, Beethoven, okay?
我看到筷子
好,貝多芬,他一看到鋼琴
He looked at a piano, and it just
made sense to him. He could just play.
很自然地就會彈
- So what are you saying? You play the piano?
- Not a lick.
你是說你會彈琴?
I look at a piano, I see a bunch of
keys, three pedals and a box of wood.
根本不會,望著鋼琴
我只看到琴鍵、踏板和木頭
But Beethoven, Mozart-
They saw it. They could just play.
但貝多芬、莫札特就會彈
I couldn't paint you a picture. I
probably can't hit the ball out of Fenway.
我不會畫畫,連球都打不好
我也不會彈琴
- And I can't play the piano. - But you
can do my O- chem paper in under an hour.
但你會一小時內做好化學作業
Right. Well, I mean, when it came to
stuff like that, I could always just play.
對,我就是會那種東西
That's the best
I can explain it.
我只能解釋到這樣
- Come here. I have to tell you something.
- Huh?
來,我有話告訴你
- I have to tell you something.
- Oh.
我跟你講一件事
Well...
- It's not fair.
- What's not fair? What?
不公平
什麼不公平?
I've been here for four years,
我在這邊四年了
and I've only just found you.
現在才發現你
Well, you found me.
起碼妳還是發現我啦
- Are you awake?
- No.
你醒著嗎?
睡了
Yes, you are.
你沒睡
跟我一起去加州
What?
什麼?
I want you to come
to California with me.
我要你跟我去加州
- You sure about that?
- Oh, yeah.
妳確定嗎?
確定
Yeah, but how do you know?
妳怎麼知道?
I don't know.
I just know.
不曉得
我就是知道
Yeah, but how do you know?
但妳怎麼會知道?
I know because I feel it.
我知道,因為我感覺到
- Because that's a really serious thing you're saying.
- I know.
妳說的是很嚴肅的事
下禮拜到了加州
You could be in California
next week...
妳可能會發現不喜歡我的地方
and you might find out
something about me you don't like.
妳會希望妳沒說過這些話
Maybe you wish
you hadn't said that,
but you know it's such a serious thing
you can't take it back.
但這是無法收回的事
Now I'm stuck in California with someone
that doesn't really want to be with me,
於是我跟不愛我的人困在加州
她卻希望一切能收回
- just wish they had a take-back.
- A what? What's a take-back?
什麼?什麼是收回?
I don't want a take-back. I just want
you to come to California with me.
我不想收回
我只要你跟我去加州
Well, I can't go to
California with you, so...
我不能去加州
Why not?
為什麼?
Well, one, because
I got a job here.
一是因為我在這邊有工作
And, two,
because I live here.
二是因為我住這邊
Look, um, if you don't love me,
you should just tell me.
你不愛我就該告訴我
I'm not sayin'
I don't love you.
我沒說不愛妳
Then why? Why won't you come?
What are you so scared of?
那為什麼不去?你怕什麼?
What am I so scared of?
我怕什麼?
你不怕什麼?
Well, what aren't
you scared of?
You live in this safe little world
where no one challenges you...
你活在沒人挑戰的世界裡
你怕要做改變你的事情
Don't tell me about my world.
Don't tell me about my world.
別告訴我,我的世界怎麼樣
You just want to have your little fling
with the guy from the other side of town.
妳只是想跟低下階層搞一下
然後到史丹佛
Then you're gonna go off to Stanford.
You're gonna marry some rich prick...
妳會嫁給有錢的混蛋
who your parents
will approve of...
跟其他富家女說妳到過貧民窟
and just sit around with
the other trust fund babies...
and talk about how you
went slummin', too, once.
你在說什麼?
Why are you saying this?
What is your obsession with this money?
你為何這麼在乎錢?
My father died when I was 13,
and I inherited this money.
我十三歲喪父,繼承家產
You don't think every day I wake up,
and I wish I could give it back.
我每天醒來都希望能還給他
That I would give it back in a second if
it meant I could have one more day with him.
只要能讓我多陪他一天
我會馬上還給他,但我不能
But I can't, and that's
my life, and I deal with it.
那是我的人生,我面對它
So don't put your shit on me
when you're the one that's afraid.
別把你的害怕推到我身上
我怕?我他媽的怕什麼?
I'm afraid? What am I afraid of?
What the fuck am I afraid of?
You're afraid of me. You're afraid
that I won't love you back.
你怕我,怕我不愛你
You know what?
I'm afraid too.
你知道嗎?我也怕
But fuck it, I want to give it a shot.
At least I'm honest with you.
但我想試試看,起碼我誠實
- I'm not honest with you?
- No, what about your 12 brothers?
難道我對妳不誠實?
不,你的十二個哥哥呢?
All right.
No, you're not going.
You're not leaving.
你不能走,不准離開
What do you want to know? That I don't
have 12 brothers? That I'm a fuckin' orphan?
妳想知道什麼?我沒哥哥?
我是個他媽的孤兒?
- You don't want to hear that.
- I didn't know that.
- 妳不會想聽的
- 我並不曉得
妳不會想聽我童年被香菸燒
You don't want to hear I got fuckin'
cigarettes put out on me when I was little.
- I didn't know that.
- That this isn't fuckin' surgery.
我不曉得
那不是手術,那混蛋刺傷我
The motherfucker stabbed me. You don't
want to hear that shit, Skylar!
妳不會想聽這種事
- I do want to hear that.
- Don't tell me you want that shit!
別跟我說妳想聽
- I want to help you.
- Help me? What the fuck?
我想聽,因為我想幫你
幫我?什麼鬼東西?
What do I got, a fuckin' sign
on my back that says, "Save me"?
我臉上有寫著請救我嗎?
- No.
- Do I look like I need that?
我像要人救的樣子嗎?
- No, I just want to be with you-
- Don't bullshit me!
我想跟你在一起,我愛你
- I love you.
- Don't bullshit me! Don't you fuckin' bullshit me!
別耍我,別他媽的耍我
I love you.
我愛你
I want to hear you say
that you don't love me.
我要聽你說你不愛我
Because if you say that...
那麼我就不再打電話給你
then I won't call you...
and I won't be in your life.
不再出現在你的生命裡
I don't love you.
我不愛妳
Most people never get to see
how brilliant they can be.
很多人都無從得知自己的天賦
They don't find teachers
that believe in them.
因為找不到相信他們的老師
They get convinced
they're stupid.
於是他們深信自己很笨
I hope you appreciate
what he's doing,
希望你能感激他所做的
because I've seen how much
he enjoys working with you,
我知道他很喜歡跟你合作
not against you.
我沒有反對你
Hello, Will.
你好,威爾
Tom, can you get us
some coffee?
湯姆,拿點咖啡來
Sure.
好
Now, let's see.
好,我看看
Good. This is correct.
很好,正確
I see you used Maclaurin here.
你用了"麥羅倫"
Yeah, I don't know what
you call it, but...
我不知道叫什麼
This can't be right.
這樣不對
This would be
very embarrassing.
這會很難堪
- Did you ever consider-
- I'm pretty sure it's right.
你是否想過...
我確信是對的
Hey, look, can we do this
at Sean's office from now on?
以後能在尚恩的辦公室做嗎?
Because I got to knock off work to come
here and the commute is killin' me.
我得放下工作過來,通車很煩
- Yeah, sure. Did you think of
the possibility- - That's right.
好,可不可能...
It's right.
Just take it home with you.
它是對的,帶回家吧
What happened
at the McNeil meeting?
麥尼爾的面談怎麼了?
I couldn't go.
I had a date.
我去不了,我有約會
So I sent my
chief negotiator.
所以我派我的談判代表去
On your own time, you can do
whatever you like, Will.
你自己的時間愛幹嘛隨你
But when I set up a meeting
with my associates,
但我安排的會談
and you don't show up,
it reflects poorly on me.
你沒出現會讓我丟臉
- Then don't set up any more meetings.
- I won't.
好,那就別安排了
I'll cancel 'em.
我不會,我會取消
I'll give you a job myself. I just
wanted you to see what was out there.
我會親自給你工作
Maybe I don't want to spend the rest of
my fuckin' life explainin' shit to people.
或許我不想一輩子做解說員
I think you could show me
some appreciation.
但你可以表示感激吧
A little appreciation?
Do you know how easy this is for me?
感激?你知道這多容易嗎?
Do you have any fuckin' idea how easy
this is? This is a fuckin' joke.
你曉得嗎?別他媽的說笑了
I'm sorry you can't do this-
I really am...
我很遺憾你不會解,真的
Because I wouldn't have to fuckin' sit here
and watch you fumble around and fuck it up.
我不想坐在這兒看你摸索
Then you'd have more time to sit around
and get drunk instead, wouldn't you?
這樣你就會有更多的時間喝醉
You're right. This is probably
a total waste of my time.
沒錯,這浪費我的時間
You're right, Will.
你說得對
I can't do this proof,
but you can.
我解不出來
And when it comes to that, it's only about
just a handful of people in the world...
但你會,說到這個
只有少數人看出你我的差別
who can tell the difference
between you and me.
- But I'm one of them.
- Sorry.
我是其中之一
我很遺憾
Yeah, so am I.
我也是
Most days I wish
I never met you,
我常希望沒遇到你
because then I could
sleep at night.
這樣我夜裡就能睡得著
I didn't have to walk around with the knowledge
that there was someone like you out there.
不用惦記有個像你這樣的人
I didn't have to watch you
throw it all away.
我不必看你糟蹋天賦
Bill, hold it. Did you hear that?
比爾,等等
聽到沒?
Morgan!
摩根
If you're watchin' pornos in my mom's room
again, I'm gonna give you a fuckin' beatin'!
如你還敢在我媽房裡看A片
我就揍扁你
What's up, fellas?
怎麼了?
Morgan, why don't you jerk off in your
own fuckin' house. That's fuckin' filthy.
要打手槍在你家裡打,髒死了
I don't have a V.C.R.
in my house.
我家沒錄影機
他媽的我不管
你不會用我手套打手槍吧
Come on. Not in my glove.
I didn't use the glove.
我沒用手套
That's my
Little League glove.
那是我的小聯盟手套
What do you want me
to do?
你要我怎麼做
I mean, what's wrong
with you?
你怎麼搞的?操棒球手套啊?
You'll hump
a baseball glove?
I- I just used it
for cleanup.
我沒有,我用它清乾淨
Stop jerkin' off in my mother's room.
別在我媽房裡打手槍了
- Is there another V.C.R. in the house?
- It's just sad, bro.
這屋裡還有別台錄影機嗎?
真可悲
So why do you think I should work
for the National Security Agency?
我為什麼該為國安局做事?
Well, you'd be working
on the cutting edge.
你將研究尖端科技
You'd be exposed to the kind of
technology you wouldn't see anywhere else,
接觸別處看不到的科技
because we've classified it.
因為都已列為機密
Superstring theory,
chaos math, advanced algorithms.
混沌數學、高級算法...
Code breaking.
破解密碼
That's one aspect
of what we do.
那是其中一個層面
Oh, come on.
That is what you do.
得了,那就是你們做的事
You guys handle 80% of
the intelligence workload.
你們處理八成的情報量
You're seven times
the size of the C.I.A.
是中情局的七倍大
We don't like to brag about that, Will,
but you're exactly right.
我們不喜歡自誇,但你說對了
So the way I see it,
the question isn't:
問題不是你幹嘛為國安局做事
"Why should you work
for the N.S.A.?"
而是你為何不做?
The question is:
"Why shouldn't you?"
Why shouldn't
I work for the N.S.A.?
我為何不為國安局做事?
That's a tough one,
but I'll take a shot.
很難的問題
讓我想想,若我做了
Say I'm workin' at the N.S.A.
and somebody puts a code on my desk.
國安局會給我破解不了的密碼
Something no one else
can break.
Maybe I take a shot at it
and maybe I break it.
或許我試了,也破解了
I'm real happy with myself
because I did my job well.
我很滿意,因為表現良好
But maybe that code was the location of some
rebel army in North Africa or Middle East.
但也許那個密碼
是位於北非或中東的叛軍位置
Once they have that location, they bomb
the village where the rebels are hidin'.
他們發現後轟炸叛軍藏身地
陌生的一千五百人因此喪命
Fifteen hundred people that I never met,
never had no problem with, get killed.
Now the politicians are saying, "Send in
the Marines to secure the area,"
然後政客派特戰部隊防守該區
'cause they don't give a shit.
他們才不在乎,因為...
It won't be their kid
over there gettin' shot,
被射殺的不會是他們的子女
just like it wasn't them when their number got
called 'cause they were in the National Guard.
因為他們都加入了後備部隊
It'll be some kid from Southie
over there takin' shrapnel in the ass.
而在那邊中彈的南區孩子
He comes back to find the plant
he used to work at...
回國後發現他以前工作的工廠
got exported to the country
he got back from,
被移轉到他去打仗的國家
and the guy who put the shrapnel
in his ass got his old job...
害他中彈的敵人搶了他的飯碗
'cause he'll work for 15 cents
a day and no bathroom breaks.
因為那個人一天工資不到一元
Meanwhile, he realizes the only reason
he was over there in the first place...
最後他發現他會上戰場
was so we could install a government
that would sell us oil at a good price.
是為了得到該國的廉價原油
Of course, the oil companies used a skirmish
over there to scare up domestic oil prices.
好讓石油公司利用戰爭恐慌
抬高國內油價,小賺一番
A cute little ancillary benefit for them, but
it ain't helpin' my buddy at 2.50 a gallon.
但兩塊五一加侖有個屁用
They're takin' their sweet time
bringin' the oil, of course.
他們得花時間把石油運回國
Maybe they even took the liberty
to hire an alcoholic skipper,
或許還請了一個酗酒船長
who likes to drink martinis and fuckin'
play slalom with the icebergs.
他愛喝馬丁尼,跟冰山玩滑雪
It ain't too long till
he hits one, spills the oil...
不久他撞上冰山,原油外漏
and kills all the sea life
in the North Atlantic.
殺光北大西洋的海洋生物
So now my buddy's out of work,
he can't afford to drive,
現在我朋友失業,也開不起車
so he's walkin' to
the fuckin' job interviews...
他走路去面談,很難受
which sucks because the shrapnel in his
ass is givin' him chronic hemorrhoids.
因為砲彈片讓你慢性出血
Meanwhile, he's starvin', 'cause every
time he tries to get a bite to eat,
他很餓,因為每次想吃東西
the only blue plate special
they're servin'...
唯一的特餐是北大西洋鱈魚
is North Atlantic scrod
with Quaker State.
So what did I think?
I'm holdin' out for somethin' better.
所以,我會怎麼想?
我有更好的點子
I figure, fuck it. While I'm at it,
why not just shoot my buddy,
幹,我乾脆射殺我朋友算了
take his job,
give it to his sworn enemy,
把工作給敵人,提高油價
hike up gas prices, bomb
a village, club a baby seal,
轟炸村莊,打死小海豹
hit the hash pipe
and join the National Guard?
吸食大麻,加入後備部隊
I can be
elected president.
我還可因此被選為總統

- What?
你感覺孤單嗎?
什麼?

Somebody who challenges you.
能夠和你匹敵的人

不,查克是你的家人
I'm talking about someone who opens
up things for you, touches your soul.
我講的是觸動你心靈的人

誰?

- Well, name 'em.
有很多
說出來
Shakespeare, Nietzsche, Frost,
O'Connor, Kant, Pope, Locke...
莎士比亞、尼采、佛斯特
奧康納、康德、洛克
That's great.
They're all dead.
很棒,他們都死了
- Not to me they're not.
- You don't have a lot of dialogue with them.
對我而言,他們沒死
沒死?你無法和他們對談
You can't give back
to them, Will.
你不能回應他們
- Not without some serious smelling salts and a heater.
- That's what I'm saying.
除非你有仙丹
對,那就是我所說的
You'll never have that kind
of relationship in a world...
如果你不踏出第一步
where you're always afraid
to take the first step,
你絕不會有那種關係
because all you see is every
negative thing ten miles down the road.
因為你只看到負面的事
- You gonna take the professor's side on this?
- Don't give me a line of shit.
你要擺出教授架子了?
少跟我來這套,沒有
- No.

我不想做那個工作
It's not about the job. I don't care
if you work for the government.

their entire life layin' brick...
有人一輩子砌磚
so their kids have a chance
at the opportunities you have here.
讓孩子擁有像你現在的機會
- I didn't ask for this.
- No.
我可沒要求這機會
不,你與生�ㄗ荋N有
You were born with it, so don't cop out
behind: "I didn't ask for this."
別逃避說你沒要求
- What do you mean, cop out? What's wrong with layin' brick?
- Nothing.
什麼叫逃避?砌磚哪裡不對?
There's nothin' wrong.
That's somebody's home I'm buildin'.
沒有
沒什麼不對,我蓋房子...
Right. My dad
laid brick, okay?
對,我爸砌磚,好嗎?
Busted his ass so
I could have an education.
他拼命幹活讓我受教育
Exactly. That's
an honorable profession.
沒錯,那是可敬的行業
What's wrong with
fixin' somebody's car?
修車哪不對?我讓人能上班
Someone will get to work the next day
because of me. That's honor in that.
這是很光榮的事
Yeah, there is, Will.
There is honor in that.
是的,是很光榮
There's honor in takin'
that 40-minute train ride...
搭40分鐘火車讓大學生...
so those college kids could come in in
the morning and their floors are clean.
上課有乾淨的環境也很可敬

對
And that's honorable. I'm sure
that's why you took that job.
對,是很可敬
相信你是為了這份榮耀才做的
I mean, for the honor of it.

You could be a janitor anywhere.
我只是有個小問題
你到哪裡都能做工友
Why did you work at the most prestigious
technical college in the whole fuckin' world?
為何挑中一流的科技學府
Why did you sneak around at night
and finish other people's formulas...
夜裡偷偷地解算
that only one or two people in the world
could do and then lie about it?

'Cause I don't see
a lot of honor in that, Will.
我看不到其中的榮耀
So what do you
really wanna do?
你真正想做什麼?
I wanna be a shepherd.
我想當牧羊人
Really?
真的?
I wanna move up to Nashua, get a nice little
spread, get some sheep and tend to them.
我想搬到納旭買塊地放羊
- Maybe you should go do that.
- What?
也許你該那麼做
什麼?
You know, if you're gonna jerk off, why don't
you just do it at home with a moist towel?
要自慰回家弄條溼毛巾搞

你擁有我們沒有的天賦
拜託,為何大家都這麼說?
Why is it always this? I fuckin'
owe it to myself to do this or that.

- What if I don't want to?
- No, no, no. Fuck you. You don't owe it to yourself.
不...你沒有對不起自己
You owe it to me,
是你對不起我
'cause tomorrow I'm gonna
wake up and I'll be 50,
因為我明天醒來五十歲了
and I'll still
be doin' this shit.
還在幹這種事,無所謂
That's all right.
That's fine.
I mean, you're sittin' on
a winnin' lottery ticket.
而你已擁有百萬獎券
You're too much of a pussy
to cash it in, and that's bullshit.
卻窩囊的不敢兌現,狗屁
'Cause I'd do fuckin' anything
to have what you got.
我會不惜一切交換你所擁有的
So would any of
these fuckin' guys.
其他這些人也是

if you're still here in 20 years.

- You don't know that.
- I don't?
你懂什麼?
- No. You don't know that.
- Oh, I don't know that. Let me tell you what I do know.
我不懂?
你不懂
我告訴你我懂什麼
Every day I come by your house,
and I pick you up.
我每天到你家接你
We go out and have a few drinks
and few laughs, and it's great.
我們出去喝酒笑鬧,那很棒
You know what the
best part of my day is?
但我一天中最棒的時刻
It's for about ten seconds: from when I pull
up to the curb and when I get to your door.
只有十秒
從停車到你家門口
'Cause I think maybe I'll get up there and
I'll knock on the door and you won't be there.
每次我敲門,都希望你不在了
No "good-bye," no "see ya later."
No nothing. You just left.
不說再見,什麼都沒有
你就走了
I don't know much,
but I know that.
我懂得不多,但我很清楚
This is a disaster, Sean.
真是亂來,我讓你參與
I brought you in here because
I wanted you to help me with the boy,
是要你幫這孩子,不是趕走他
- not to run him out.
- I know what I'm doing with the boy.
我知道怎麼應付他
I don't care if you have
a rapport with the boy!
我不管你跟他有什麼默契
I don't care if you have a few laughs,
even at my expense.
我不在乎你們花我的錢開心
但你敢破壞我的事看看
- But don't you dare undermine what I'm trying to do here.
- Undermine?
破壞?
This boy is at
a fragile point right now.
這孩子目前很脆弱
I do understand. He is at
a fragile point. He's got problems.
我了解他很脆弱,好嗎?
他還有些問題
What problems does he have? That he's
better off as a janitor, in jail?
他有什麼問題?
當工友或坐牢會比較好嗎?
Better hanging out with
a bunch of retarded gorillas?
跟一群智障在一起會比較好嗎?
Why do you think he does that?
You have any fuckin' clue why?
你想他為什麼那麼做?
你曉得為什麼嗎?
He can handle the problems. He can
handle the work. He obviously handled you.
他能應付問題
應付工作,顯然也應付你了
Listen to me.
Why is he hiding?
聽我說
他為何躲避?為何不信任人?
Why doesn't
he trust anybody?
Because the first thing
that happened to him,
因為他被應該愛他的人遺棄
he was abandoned by the people
who were supposed to love him the most.
別跟我講佛洛伊德的屁話
Don't give me
that Freudian crap.
他為什麼跟你所謂的智障混?
Why does he hang out with those
retarded gorillas, as you call them?
因為如果他叫他們扁你
Because any one of them, if he asked
them to, would take a bat to your head.
他們會照辦,那叫做義氣
- That's called loyalty.
- Yeah, that's very touching.
是喔,很感人
他應付誰了?
Who's he handling? He pushes people away
before they have a chance to leave him.
他在別人離開之前先趕人走
It's a defense mechanism,
all right?

For 20 years, he's been
alone because of that.

be the same thing all over again.

I'm not gonna
let that happen to him.
我不會讓他重蹈覆轍
- Don't you do that.
- What?
別那麼做
Don't infect him with the idea that it's
okay to quit, that it's okay to be a failure.
什麼?
別讓他認為放棄沒關係
或失敗沒關係,絕對有關係
Because it's not okay, Sean!
And if you're angry at me for being successful,
for being what you could have been...
如果你是氣我成功...
- I'm not angry at you.

apologize for any success I've had.
我不會因為成功向你賠不是
You're angry at me for doing
what you could have done!
你氣我做到你本來能做到的事
But ask yourself, Sean-
Ask yourself...
你捫心自問
if you want Will to feel that way-
if you want him to feel like a failure?
你要威爾有那種感受?
你要他感覺像失敗者?
You arrogant shit!
你這個自大狂
That's why I don't come to the goddamn reunions,
'cause I can't stand that look in your eye.
我不去同學會的原因
是因為受不了你的眼神

I'm proud of what I do. It was
a conscious choice. I didn't fuck up!
我為自己感到驕傲
那是自覺的選擇

I'm some sort of pity case.
你和你朋友認為我很可憐
You and your kiss-ass chorus following
you around going, "The Field's medal!"
你和你那些狗屁課程
你老是提自己的菲爾德獎章...
Why are you still so
fuckin' afraid of failure?
你怎麼還是這麼怕失敗?
It's about my medal, isn't it? Oh, God, I could
go home and get it for you. You can have it.
你是嫉妒我有獎章嗎?
天哪,我回家拿給你
送給你好了
Shove the medal up
your fuckin' ass, all right?
拜託不要
把獎章塞進你媽的屁眼裡
'Cause I don't give
a shit about your medal,
因為我不在乎你的獎章
because I knew you before
you were a mathematical god,
因為我在你還沒當上
數學之神以前,就認識你了
when you were pimple-faced and homesick and
didn't know what side of the bed to piss on.
早在你滿臉青春痘、思鄉...
不知要尿在床的那一頭的時候
Yeah, you were smarter than me then
and you're smarter than me now.
是,你過去現在都比我聰明
So don't blame me for
how your life turned out.

I won't see you make him
feel like a failure too!
讓他也感覺是失敗者

他不會失敗
你如果逼他...
I am what I am today because I was pushed
and because I learned to push myself.
我能有今天成就是逼出來的
He's not you!
You get that!
他不是你,你聽懂沒?
