Hey, Commander,
uh, so, as I was saying,
嘿，指揮官
in "The Quasar Dilemma," remember,
you used the auxiliary of deck B--
在「類星體的困境」中，
你使用了控制B的後備動力
could you get this--
deck B for gamma override.
你怎麼能不怕輻射來到控制台B呢？
The thing is is that

問題是，是不是設計圖清楚地顯示
that deck B is independent
of the guidance matrix.
甲板B是獨立於導航模型的嗎？
So, we were wondering
just where the error lies in that.
我們想知道，問題出在哪裡
It's just a television show.

讓我想想，他需要考慮
No, Jason, that's a wrap.

要不我就摧毀你的飛船
You know, um,
we'd like do that,

It's-It's-It's-It's
my fault.
是，是，是，我的錯
-We-We screwed--
-We are not the people you think we are.
我們，我們並不像你們想像的那樣
I don't understand.
我不明白
Didn't you make any TV shows
on your planet ? Any theater, films ?
在你們的星球上，有沒有電視節目？
有戲劇，電影嗎？
The historical documents
of your culture.
關於你們自己文化的記錄片
Yes, in fact, we have begun to document
our history from your example.
是，實際上，我們已經
開始學習你們記錄歷史了
No, not historical documents. They're
not all historical documents. I mean,
不，不是歷史記錄片
我的意思是，那些並不全是記錄片
surely you don't think
that Gilligan's Island is a--
你不會認為吉利干s島是個……
- [ All Moaning ]
- Those poor people.
那些可憐的傢伙
[ Tommy ]
Oh, brother.
哦，兄弟
We're screwed.
我們搞咂了
Is there no one on your planet
who behaves in a way...
在你們的星球上沒有人
that's contrary
to reality ?
做一些和事實相反的事情嗎？
[ Gasping ]
You are speaking of--
你是說……
- Deception, lies.
- Deception, lies.
We have only recently
become aware of this concept
in our dealings with Sarris.
欺騙，謊言
欺騙，謊言
我們也是最近和薩理斯打交道時
才對欺騙有了些概念
Often, Sarris will say one thing
and do another.
薩理斯經常嘴上這麼說
做起來又是另一回事
Promise us mercy,
but deliver destruction.
許諾我們以仁慈，卻施以毀滅
It is a concept we are beginning
to learn at some great costs.
我們花了很大的代價才開始瞭解這個概念
But if you are saying that
any of you could have traits
in common with Sarris--
你們不是說你們和薩理斯有什麼共同點吧--
- [ Laughing ]
- [ All Laughing ]
[ Laughing ]
Hey, Commander, listen. We found
some beryllium on a nearby planet.
指揮官，我們在附近的星球上發現了鈹金
We might be able to get there...
我們也許能到那裡
if we reconfigure
the solar matrix...
只要我們改裝一下我們的太陽能模型
in parallel
for endothermic propulsion.
設置成平行向熱推進
What do you think ?
你怎麼想？
- We'll do that !
- All right !
我們試試！
好的！
That's-That's-That's
right again.
這就對了
That's-- C-C-Come on.
Group hug.
來吧，擁抱一下
- Come on.
- [ All Murmuring ]
來啊
Dr. Lazarus, I hope
I am not breaching protocol,
拉扎羅斯博士，但願我沒有違約
but I am so very humbled
to stand in your presence.
我站在你面前覺得很渺小
I have studied your missions
extensively.
我對你所有的任務都仔細研究過
Though I am Thermian, I have lived
my life by your philosophy,
雖然，我是個賽米亞人
但我是按照你們的人生觀來生活的
by the code
of the Mak'tar.
也遵守馬卡他星球的法律
- Oh, good, that's very nice.
- By Grabthar's hammer, Dr. Lazarus.
很好
上帝作證，拉扎羅斯博士
- Don't do that. I'm not kidding.
- I'm sorry, sir, I was just--
別這樣，我沒開玩笑
抱歉，先生，我只是……
Just don't.
別那樣
Yes, sir.
是的，先生
Never give up,
never surrender.
永不放棄，永不妥協
Dr. Lazarus ?
拉扎羅斯博士？
Here is your surface mapper. I have
programmed it to the coordinates...
這是你要的表面對照轉換器
of a beryllium sphere
of sufficient density.
我把他設計成能匹配足夠密度的鈹金球
- Good luck on your mission, sir.
- Thanks.
祝好運，先生
謝謝
You're doing good,
Tommy.
你幹的很好，湯米
I changed my mind.
I wanna go back.
我改主意了，我要回去
After the fuss you made
about getting left behind ?
你搞得一團糟，現在你想回去了？
Yeah, but that's when I thought
I was the crewman...
是的，當我認為我是你們的一員的時候
我是這麼想的
that stays on the ship, and something
is up there, and it kills me.
呆在飛船上
外面有什麼在等著我，這讓我很苦惱
But now I'm thinking I'm the guy
who gets killed by some monster...
但現在我想只要我們降落在那個星球上
five minutes after we land
on the planet.
不出5分鐘，我們就會被某個怪物殺掉
You're not gonna die
on the planet, Guy.
你不會死的，夥計
I'm not ?
Then what's my last name ?
我不會？
我姓什麼？
It's, uh, uh--
I don't know.
我不知道
Nobody knows !
Do you know why ?
沒人知道，你知道為什麼嗎？
Because my character isn't
important enough for a last name,
因為我只是個跑龍套的，根本不重要
because I'm gonna die
five minutes in.
因為我只有5分鐘的戲，就會被安排死掉
Guy, you have a last name.
夥計，你有名字的
- Do I ? Do I ?
- Yes !
For all you know,
I'm just crewman number six.
我有嗎？
是的！
你們知道的僅僅是我是那個編外船員
Mommy ! Mommy ! Mommy !
媽媽！媽媽！
Are we there yet ?
我們到了嗎？
- Mommy !
- [ Jason ] Tommy !
媽媽！
湯米！
- Look out ! Oh, no !
- [ Alexander ] Pull out !
當心！，哦，不！
停下來！
[ Fred Moaning ]
Oh, yeah !
是的！
[ Moaning Continues ]
- [ Beeping ]
- [ Guy ] Don't open that !
It's an alien planet !
別開門，這是個外星球
Is there air ?
You don't know !
外面有空氣嗎？你根本不知道！
[ Sniffing, Breathing ]
Seems okay.
看上去還行
Here we go.
我們走吧
[ Jason ]
Which way, Alexander ?
哪邊，亞歷山大？
[ Beeping ]
This way !
這邊！
Wait. No.
等等……不……
- That way.
- You were holding it upside down.
那邊
你拿到了
- Shut up.
- You know, with
all that makeup and stuff,
閉嘴
穿著這些戲服和化妝時
I actually thought
you were smart for a second.
我實際上覺得你很聰明，當然只一秒種
You think you could
do better, Laredo ?
你認為，你會做的更好嗎，拉來多？
- All right with that Laredo stuff.
- [ Guy ] Oh, we're so screwed.
拉來多沒什麼問題
真是糟透了
Come on, come on, come on,
if we wanna finish this mission,
we have to use self-control.
好了，好了
我們必須能夠自製才能完成任務
[ Gwen ] "Self-control" ?
That's funny, coming from a guy...
自制，從一個在戲裡
和女奴、月亮公主鬼混的傢伙
who slept with every Turekian slave
girl and moon princess on the show.
嘴裡說出來，很可笑
[ Jason ] Ever occur to you,
had you been more supportive,
you might've been--
你究竟怎麼了
如果你不是那麼多怪話，你也許已經……
[ Alexander ] Wow. Must be
some sort of mining facility.
哇喔，也許是些採礦設備
- Where are the miners ?
- Something bad happened here.
- Will you relax ?
- [ Beeping ]
礦工們在哪裡？
肯定發生了什麼事
放鬆一點好嗎？
There they are.
Beryllium spheres. Let's go.
鈹金球在那裡，我們走
- [ Gasping ]
- [ Chattering ]
Look at that.
看
Would you look at that ?
They look like little children.
看那邊，他們看上去象小孩子
Could they be the miners ?
他們是礦工嗎？
Sure, they're like
three years old.
一定是，他們看上去只有3歲
Miners, not minors.
礦工，不是未成年人
- You lost me.
- I don't like this.
你沒明白我
我不喜歡這樣
- I don't like this at all.
- They are so cute.
Sure, they're cute now.
In a second, they're gonna get mean.
They're gonna get ugly somehow, then
there's gonna be a million more of them.
我一點也不喜歡這樣
他們太可愛了
是的，他們現在很可愛
很快他們就會不客氣了
他們很快就會變得很難看
還會有另外幾百萬個出現
[ Gasping ] Look.
There's a little hurt one.
看，那個小傢伙受傷了
[ Whimpering ]
Oh.
哦
[ Whimpering Continues ]
Hi.
Hi there.
嗨
- Ah !
- Shh !
啊！
噓！
- Did you guys ever watch the show ?
- [ Chattering ]
你們看過那場戲嗎？
See ?
看過嗎？
They're gonna help
the little hurt one.
他們會幫助那受傷的小傢伙的
[ Whispering ]
[ Snarling ]
I'm so sick
of being right.
我說得沒錯，但我感到很噁心
- Let's get out of here before
one of those things kills Guy.
- Wait a minute.
在他們開始殺人之前
我們趕快走吧，等等
We're not going anywhere without
a beryllium sphere. We need a plan.
沒拿到鈹金球
我們哪兒也不去，我們需要計劃一下
Fred, I need a diversion
to clear the compound of those things.
弗來德，你去把他們引開
Then, Alex and Gwen and I
will go get a sphere.
亞力克斯，格溫，和我去拿鈹金球
Tommy, get up on that ridge,
and if you see them come back,
give me a signal, all right ?
湯米，到那山脊上去
看到他們回來，就給我個信號。
Why does this sound
so familiar ?
怎麼聽起來很熟啊
"Assault on Voltareck 3,"
episode 81.
是81集的台詞
- We're doing episode 81 ?
- Whatever. The one with
the hologram, the wall of fire.
我們在演第81集？
那個有火牆，全息圖的一集？
Well, how the hell is Fred
supposed to project a hologram ?
弗來德怎麼會能發送全息圖呢？
- What did we do in episode 81 ?
- It's just a rough plan.
我們在81集怎麼做的？
這只是個大概的方案
- What difference does it make
if it's episode 81 or not ?
- 'Cause I died in episode 81 !
是不是81集有什麼區別嗎？
有！我在那集死掉了
- Shh ! Episode 51, right ?
- This is ludicrous.
噓！那就51集，可以了吧？
真荒唐
Why are you listening to this fellow ?
May I remind you:
你們為什麼要聽他的？我提醒你們
He's wearing a costume,
not a uniform.
他穿的是戲服，不是制服！
He's no more equipped to lead us
than this fellow. No offense.
他並不比這傢伙更配領導我們
沒有冒犯的意思
Look, they're gone.
看，他們走了
- Where'd they go, back inside ?
- I don't know.
去哪裡了？
我不知道
- Nobody was watching.
- All right, all right !
沒人放哨了
好了，好了
Listen up. Here's the plan.
Gwen, Fred, Alex and l,
we'll go down and get a sphere.
聽著格溫，弗來德，亞力克斯和我去拿鈹金球
Fleegman, you set up a perimeter,
and Tommy, you're lookout.
弗裡曼, 你建個臨時工事，湯米，你放哨
- You see anything at all,
you give us a signal.
- What kind of a signal ?
不管見到什麼，給我們個信號
什麼樣的信號？
- Any kind of signal.
- Okay, I'll do my hands
like this, and caw, caw !
隨便
好的，我把手弄成這樣，然後嘎嘎叫！
What are you, an infant ?
Look, we have these.
你是嬰兒嗎？看好，這樣來
- That-- Sorry.
- All right, let's go.
抱歉
好了，我們走
[ Grunting ]
- Does rolling help ?
- Uh-huh, it helps.
翻跟頭有幫助嗎？
啊哈，是的
- Where's your gun ?

你的槍呢？
它也有用，開槍！
- Oh.
- What ?
什麼？
[ Jason Chuckling ]
Never give up, never surrender.
永不放棄，永不妥協
[ Together ]
Oh, shut up.
閉嘴

我知道了！我知道！
- Go ahead.
- There's no time. Get in, get in.
向前跑
來不及了。進去，進去
Of course, I forgot, you've got
to be the hero. Haven't you ?
當然，我忘記了
你一直是扮英雄的，是嗎？
Heaven forbid anybody else gets
the spotlight ! Oh, no, Jason Nesmith--
但願別人不會成為主角！
哦，不，賈森耐斯密斯

快！湯米，快點！
Help ! No, no, no ! Jason, please !

救命！不！不！賈森，求你了！
湯米，停下太空艙，停下！
- I can't stop it. It's on autopilot.
- Go ! Leave him !
我停不了，這是自動駕駛的
走！別管他！
[ Gwen ]
No !
不！

Jason ? Jason,
can you hear me ?
賈森
能聽見我嗎？
- Yeah, Gwen, you got me.
- Thank God. Are you okay ?
是，格溫，聽見了
感謝上帝，你還好嗎？
Yeah. As a matter of fact,
I've got Gorignak staring me
in the face right now.
是的，有個怪物正在我面前盯著我看呢
But you know what ?
I think I can take him.
但，我想我們能幹掉它

Jason, we're gonna use the digital
conveyor to get you out of there.
賈森, 我們準備用數字傳送器把你弄出來

是的
You gonna have me diced into cubes
and sent up there in a million pieces ?
你要把我切成一百萬個小塊然後送過去？

- Well, you know what ?
是的
那好
I think I'll take my chances
with Gorignak.
我想我寧願試試和這怪物分個勝負
We're getting you out right now.
It's perfectly safe, isn't it, Teb ?
It has never been
successfully tested.
- What did he say ?
- Hold, please.
我們會把你弄出來的
很安全的，是不是，泰博？
試驗從沒成功過
你說什麼？
請等一等
Theoretically, the mechanism
is fully operational.
理論上是完全可行的
However, it was built to accommodate
your anatomy, not ours.
但那是根據你們的生理構造設計的，
而不是根據我們的
But now that Tech Sergeant Chen
is here, he can operate it.
但技師陳中士在這裡，他能搞定
It was designed watching his motions
from the historical documents.
這就是根據他在記錄片裡的動作設計而成的
I-l-l mean, I can't.
[ Stammering ]
我是說，我不能
- I-l can supervise.
- Jason, we're gonna test it.
我會指導的
賈森，我們來試試
- On what ?
- How about that pig lizard ?
什麼？
那豬一樣的蜥蜴怎麼辦？
- Hey, I'm doing all right
with the pig lizard.
- Please, Fred. And hurry.
嘿，我能對付的了這個胖怪物
弗來德，請你快點
[ High-Pitched Squeal ]
I'm sorry. It's very exciting
to watch the master at the controls.
抱歉，看大師操縱使我很興奮
The operation of the conveyor is
much more-- hmm-mmm-- art than science.
操縱這傳輸器，與其說是科學不如說是藝術
Stand back, Jason.
向後站，賈森
Gorignak, Gorignak,
Gorignak.
Gorignak, Gorignak,
Gorignak
[ Growling ]
[ All Screaming, Groaning ]
- What ? What was that ?
- Uh--
- Nothing.
那是什麼？
沒什麼
- I heard some squealing or something.
- Oh, no, everything's fine.
我聽到一些聲音
沒有，一切正常
But the animal is
inside out.
但那怪物從裡面被翻轉過來了
I heard that.
It turned inside out ?
我聽到了，被翻轉過來了？
[ Screaming ]
And it exploded.

turned inside out and exploded ?
我是不是聽見那怪物被翻轉，而且爆炸了？
Hello ?
喂？
Hold, please.
等一等
Hey, wait a minute.
Guys, guys.
嘿，夥計們，等一等
If the pig lizard is gone,
why are they still yelling "Gorignak."
如果那豬一樣的蜥蜴已經死了
他們怎麼還在叫"Gorignak」
Teb, hit
the translation circuit.
泰博，啟動傳送電路

Gorignak, Gorignak. Rock.
Gorignak, Gorignak
Rock, rock, rock.
石頭，石頭，石頭
- [ Chattering ]
- Jason,
賈森
I don't think the pig lizard
was Gorignak.
我不認為他們喊的Gorignak是指那個胖蜥蜴
What the hell
you talkin' about ?
你在說什麼？
Oh, darn.
哦，媽的
[ Sighs ]
Digitize me !
快把我帶走！
- Come on, Fred.
- Come on, guys, digitize me !
快啊，弗來德，動手啊
- Not me.
- Come on, they based it
on your hand movements.
不是我
來吧，你只要動動手就行了
- Am I the only one who saw
that thing inside out ?
- No, no, no, no.
難道就是我一個人看到那怪物
被從裡向外翻轉的嗎？
不，不，不
I-I-I'm not the guy.
我不是那傢伙
I'm not Tech Sergeant Chen.
Kwan's not even my real name.
我不是技師陳中士，卡萬甚至不是我的真名
Fred's no good, Jason.
You're just gonna have to kill it.
弗來德，不行啊，賈森
你必須自己殺掉那傢伙
Kill it ? Well,
I'm open to any suggestions.
殺掉它？真是個好主意
Go for the eyes,
like in episode 22 !
打它眼睛，就像在22集裡做的
It doesn't have
any eyes, Tommy.
它根本就沒有眼睛，湯米
Go for the mouth or throat,
its vulnerable spots !
那就打它的嘴或者喉嚨
那地方很脆弱
It's a rock.
It doesn't have any vulnerable spots !
它是岩石，根本沒有脆弱的地方！
I know ! You construct a weapon.
Look around you.
我知道了，那你找件武器，你四周看看
- Can you form some sort
of rudimentary lathe ?
- A lathe !
你能變個什麼武器來嗎？
Get off the line, Guy ! Alexander,
you're my advisor. Advise me.
別胡扯了，夥計！亞歷山大，
你是我的參謀，給點建議啊
Well, you're just gonna have to
figure out what it wants.
你必須弄清楚它到底想要什麼
What is its motivation ?
它的動機是什麼？
It's a rock monster.
It doesn't have motivation.
它是岩石怪物，根本沒有什麼動機
See, that's your problem, Jason.
You were never serious about the craft.
看，那就是你的問題了，賈森
你從來就沒有真正關心過我們的飛船
[ Screaming ]
Oh ! Fred, can you hear me ?
哦，弗來德，你聽見我嗎？
Fred, are you there ?
[ Screaming ]
弗來德，你在嗎？
- Kinda.
- You can do it, Fred. It's up to you.
在
你能做到，弗來德，全靠你了
Oh, no, no, no. Jason,
I'll just-- I'll just mess it up.
哦，不不，賈森，我會弄糟的
You did it for four years
on the show. Do it now.
你在電視上做了4年，快動手
That was the show.
I'm not that guy.
那僅僅是電視節目，我沒那本事
You never forgot a line.
You never missed a mark.
你從來沒忘記過台詞，從沒錯過標記
[ Grunting ]
That's not me anymore, man.
那不再是我了，夥計
It is you, Fred.
You just stopped trying.
是你，弗來德，你只要再試試
You could do this, Fred. I know
in my heart, you're gonna save my life.
你能做到，弗來德

to get your shirt off.
我看到你終於把衣服脫掉了

我做到了，歡迎回來，弗來德
All right, did we get
the beryllium sphere installed ?
