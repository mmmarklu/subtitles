大概只是風吧
Maybe it's the wind.
不！
No!
住手！
Stop!
拜託你們！住手！
Please! Stop!
塔克
Tucker!
再給你一周時間，埃文斯
下次就把房子也燒了
You have a week, Evans.
Then we burn the house.
威廉？
William?
嘿！威廉！
Hey! William!
出來，出來！
Out. Out!
威廉！
William!
該死，威廉！
God damn it, William!
William!
該死！放下！
God damn it!
Put that down!
- 過來！
- 放開我！
- Come here!
- Let go!
放開我！
Let go!
這是我們最後的飼料了！
lt's the last feed we got!
我會處理好的
l'll take care of this.
你才不會呢！
No, you won't.
牲口該過山脊了
Herd's over the ridge by now.
你去收拾一下吧
You go get cleaned up.
你騙我
You lied to me, Dan.
你說我們付過錢給郝蘭德了
You told me we made payments to Hollander.
是付過啊…一部分
We did...some.
不然你以為我們買飼料的錢哪兒來的，
愛麗絲？
How do you think
we bought feed, Alice?
還有三個月的水錢？
Three months water?
給馬克的藥錢？
Medicine for Mark?
養活一家子還是還債
我得權衡啊
l had a choice between
our family and paying it down.
這事我們應該一起商量吧
We're supposed to make
decisions together.
結果有區別嗎？
Would you have made it any different?
愛麗絲，我們一塊再怎麼商量
也沒法讓老天下雨
Alice, we can't make it rain together.
或是把荒地變成草原
Or turn the dust into grass.
也沒法阻止郝蘭德
把我們的地賣給鐵路公司
Can't stop Hollander from selling
our land to the railroad, either.
埃塞克斯的醫生當時
給我少救回一截腿就好了
lt's too bad the doctors at Essex
saved so much of my leg.
聽說撫恤金現在按磅算了
l read that the pension act
pays by the pound now.
別那樣看我
Stop looking at me like that.
你要去找警長說理嗎？
You gonna tell the marshal
what those men did?
警長有個屁用啊
Marshal ain't doing shit.
- 威廉
- 現在首先要做的
- William.
- First thing, Mark,
就是帶你們去把牲口們圈起來
l'm gonna take you boys, and
we're gonna round up the herd,
然後我去趟鎮裡
and then l'm goin' into town.
你去鎮裡幹嘛？
What are you gonna do in town?
我要跟郝蘭德說清楚
l'm gonna tell Hollander to make this right.
我要讓他
l'm gonna tell him...
賠我一個新的穀倉
to pay for a new barn.
我們不如像威爾說的那樣，一槍斃了他
Maybe we should
just shoot him like Will says.
運鈔車是去巴士比的，老大
Coach is headed for Bisbee, Boss.
鐵板加厚，車頂有天窗，車上有保鏢
Girded with iron, Pinks on top,
雙管獵槍
double shotguns,
還有一挺蓋特林機槍
and a Gatling.
你應該讓我去搶救飼料的
You shoulda let me save the feed.
你要當了它？
You gonna hock that?
總有一天
Someday, William...
當你成為我的時候，你就會理解
you walk in my shoes,
you might understand.
我永遠不會成為你
l ain't ever walking in your shoes.
這邊有腳印
Tracks over here.
來了
Here we go.
- 肯尼，準備好！
- 他們來了！
- Kenny, here we go.
- Here they come.
拉到那邊！
Pull that way!
這個！
Now that one!
開槍啊！別讓他們得手！
Use the gun.
Don't let 'em get it.
馬克，過來
Mark, stay near.

快跑
Keep 'em goin'.
停！停！
Pull up. Pull up.
停下！
Pull up!
早啊，鏢師
Morning, Pinkerton.
我叫查理·王子
Name's Charlie Prince.
你該聽說過吧
l expect you heard of me.
我只聽說過
Well, l heard of a...
有個婊子叫
balled-up whore named...
查理·公主
Charlie Princess.
是你嗎，小妞？
That you, missy?
我討厭鏢師
l hate Pinkertons.
拜倫·邁克埃爾羅伊
Byron McElroy.
你什麼時候變得白髮蒼蒼了
When did your hair
turn all gray, Byron?
去死吧班·韋德
Go to hell, Ben Wade.
你看
Well, would you look at all this?
這回你們破財了吧
Y'all spared no expense this time, Byron.
我說，還不如
l gotta say, though,
it's probably cheaper
讓我們搶了合算
just to let me rob the damn thing.
你要殺我
lf you're gonna kill me,
就殺吧
just as soon get to it.
我不殺你
l ain't gonna kill you.
不會這樣讓你死
Not like this.
讓我活下來也改變不了事實
Won't change a thing, lettin' me live.
我不會放過你的
l'll come for you.
如果你放過我，我倒該感到失望了
l'd be disappointed if you didn't.
點著了！
- She's lit!
- She's lit!
好了
All right, boys.
來了，滿的呢
There you go.
lt's full.
好了，給你
All right. There you go.
再給我一點吧
Come on, give me one.
One more.
把錢放下！
l'll ask you
to put down the money.
退下！你們都退下！
You step back!
You men step back!
不然我就斃了他
All of you step back right now,
or this man dies!
這樣做很不明智哦
Not a smart move, friend.
該死
Shit.
出手真快啊
He's fast.
湯米
Well, Tommy...
看起來有個車裡有個鏢師
it seems that
there was a Pinkerton...
似乎並沒有死
inside that coach
that wasn't quite dead yet.
我知道查理跟你說過
Now, l know Charlie told you,
因為
because...
我們這一行有些個規矩
we done got but a few rules in this outfit.
你讓我們受到威脅，就是這樣的下場
And this is what happens
when you put us all at risk.
馬克，看著我
Mark, look at me.
Look at me.
看著我，悄悄地後退
Keep lookin' at me.
Back up quietly.
往後……威廉！
Back-- William!
威廉，看著我，退後
William, look at me.
Back up.
威廉，看著我
William, look at me.
早啊
Morning.
那是我的牛
Those are my cattle.
我想要回它們
l want 'em back.
小心哦，土農夫，你可是在跟班·韋德說話
Careful, rancher,
that's Ben Wade you're talking to.
我要我的牛
Well, l need 'em back.
我就只剩下它們了
They're all l got.
我不需要你的牛
l don't need your cattle.
但我想要你的馬
But l will be needin' them horses.
那樣你就不會幹什麼……傻事
So you don't go doing nothing... foolish.
康普思
Campos.
在往巴士比的路上你能找到他們
You'll find them on the road to Bisbee.
告辭了
Boys.
可能只是遲到了吧，巴特菲先生
They're probably
just running late, Mr. Butterfield.
鏢師們不會遲到
Pinkertons don't run late.
所以他們值１８美元一天
That's why they're paid $18 a day.
把我扶起來
Get me on my feet.
你現在這樣別亂動
l think you're in pretty bad shape, mister.
- 你應該……
- 把我扶起來就是了
- You should--
- Just get me on my damn feet.
馬克， 威廉，幫我那點那裡的木板來
Mark, William, get me some of them boards.
有什麼事嗎？
Can l help you?
我想大概
l think maybe...
有一輛運鈔車，在過來這裡的路上
a coach headed for here got itself held up
在距離10英里的峽谷裡被劫了
in the canyon about 10 miles back...
該死
God damn it.
是班·韋德先生親自下的手
...by Mr. Ben Wade himself.
你怎麼知道是韋德
How did you know it was Wade?
他都作過21件案子，警長
lt's been him the last 21 times, Marshal.
我看到一個墨西哥狙擊手和一個印第安人
l saw a Mexican sharpshooter
and an Apache.
- 該死，天啊
- 我還聽說……
- God damn it. Jesus Christ.
- And l've been told--
你看到"上帝之手"嗎?
Did you see The Hand of God?
- 那是什麼?
- 他的手槍
- What's that?
- His pistol.
你為什麼沒阻止他們？
Why the hell didn't
you do something?
他們有很多武器，先生
They had a lot of weapons, mister...
正在駁火呢
and they were shootin' bullets.
走吧，我們在浪費時間
Let's go. We're wasting time.
你從哪裡來的？
Where you from, anyway?
湯姆·康拉德在墨西哥買了一千頭牛
Tom Conrad bought
a thousand head in Mexico.
雇我們押送過來
Hired us to drive 'em in.
走吧
Let's go.
Come on, boys.
鐵路公司那人好像遇到麻煩了
Something's going on
with the railroad man.
老闆娘，給我朋友來幾杯威士忌
Ma'am? Some whiskey for my friends.
走吧
Let's go.

Here's to the four we lost in battle.
敬老大
And here's to the boss,
他……

今天不得不送湯米·德登上路

to Tommy Darden today.
實在是遺憾
And that's too bad.
《箴言篇》13:3
Proverbs 13:3.
「謹守其口
''He that keepeth his mouth,
得保生命
''keepeth his life.
口嘴大張
''He that opens his lips too wide
必致敗亡」
shall bring on his own destruction.''
阿門
Amen.
湯米軟弱
Tommy was weak.

他們打算越過邊境
They're going across the border.
我不會走遠
l won't be far.
我等你
l'll wait for you.
好，查理
All right, Charlie.
我以前見過你
l've seen you someplace before.
是嗎？
Have you?
你是不是曾經在 萊德威爾的
一個愛爾蘭瞎子那裡打過工？
You ever work for
a blind lrishman in Leadville?
我以前是個歌手
l was a singer.
那一段是我一生中最好的時光

醫生說我該到氣候乾燥點的地方

多到我都記不清
You know, l spent more money
in that joint than l could tell you.

Her name was Velvet.
沒人能忘記「天鵝絨」
Nobody forgets Velvet.
你看起來有點消瘦
You look kinda skinny.

沒關係
That's all right.
我不介意消瘦女人

只要她有一雙綠色的眼睛就好
Long as they got green eyes
to make up for it.
你的眼睛是綠色的嗎？
Have you got green eyes?
沒關係
That's all right.
不綠也沒關係
They don't have to be green.
他們是不是撒謊？
Do you think they lied?
是不是偷了我們的馬不還了？
Do you think they stole our horses?
他們才不要我們的爛馬呢
They don't need our shit horses.
別亂說話
Watch your mouth.
我帶他去鎮裡
l'll take him into town on my own.
你們倆看好牛
You boys go round up the herd.
小心點，我再也經不起損失了
Don't push them too hard.
l can't afford any more dropping.
先生，我們要把你抬起來，抬到那匹馬上
Mister, we're gonna have to lift you up
to get you on top of that horse.
那有一隊人馬過來
Here comes the Cavalry.
照我說的做
Do as l said.
他是車上的嗎？
ls he from the coach?
只有他活下來了
Only one who made it.
邁克埃爾羅伊先生，你能聽見我說話嗎？
Mr. McElroy, can you hear me?
是班·韋德幹的
lt was Ben Wade.
邁克埃爾羅伊先生，你能聽見我說話嗎？
Mr. McElroy, can you hear me?
邁克埃爾羅伊先……
Mr. Mc--
得給他療傷
This man needs attention.
你看到他們往哪邊走了嗎？
You see which way he rode, Evans?
好像是要到巴士比去
Looked like they were headed to Bisbee.
你知道……
You know...
邊界的南邊有個小鎮
there's a little town
just south of the border...
一個漂亮的小鎮
pretty little pueblucho
down by the river.
那裡的人會付大錢聽白種女人唱歌
Folks would pay good money
to hear a white woman sing.
恩
Yeah.
想像我挽著班·韋德

Jump out that back window with me now.
你瘋了
You're crazy.
你是醫生？
You the doctor?
對
Yes.
運鈔車被劫了
Coach got held up.
扶他上桌子
Get him on the table.
- 他叫什麼？
- 拜倫·邁克埃爾羅伊
- What's his name?
- Byron McElroy.
他是個賞金獵人，受雇於保鏢公司
He's a bounty hunter
under contract with the Pinkertons.
邁克埃爾羅伊先生，你失了很多血
You've lost a lot of blood, Mr. McElroy.
子彈還在裡面
That bullet's still in there.
取出來
Well, get it out.
好
All right.
會非常非常疼的
Now, what l'm about to do
is gonna hurt like a son of a bitch.
又不是第一次中槍了
Ain't the first time l been shot.
扶住他
Hold him, please.
別碰我
Don't touch me.
好
All right.
你他媽到底是什麼醫生？
What the fuck kind
of doctor are you, anyway?
能碰上一個會說話的病人還真不錯

with a patient for a change.
下面有什麼發現嗎？
You see anything down there?
警長，韋德的馬
Marshal.
Wade's horse.

We're movin' up.
郝蘭德先生
Mr. Hollander?
塔克，去酒吧
Tucker, go on to the saloon.
你沒有權燒我的房子
You got no right
to do what you done.
你聽到沒？
You hear me?
那是我的地
That's my land.
下星期就不是你的了
Come next week it's not, Evans.
你借了一大筆錢，我有權利收回
You borrowed a good deal of money
and l got rights to recompense.
但你在我的溪流上游建水壩，
截斷了我的水
But you dammed up my creek.
You shut off my water.
你這樣我怎麼能還你的債
How'd you expect me
to pay off my debts if you can't--
水流到你的地之前
Before the water touches your land,
改流到我那裡了
it resides and flows on mine.
我他媽愛怎麼著就怎麼著
And as such, l can do with it
as l fuckin' please.
滾回家收拾鋪蓋走人吧
Go home and pack up.
你能不……
Can you--
能不能讓我呆到春天？
Can you just
let me get to spring?
到時候我就能周轉過來
l can turn the corner.
人有事需要有勇氣來看清楚自己的渺小
Sometimes a man has to be
big enough to see how small he is.
鐵路要修過來了
Railroad's coming, Dan.
你滾蛋了，那塊地會更值錢
Your land's worth more with you off it.
郝蘭德！
Hollander!
怎麼了，土農夫
You look a little bent, rancher.
過來鬧事嗎？
You come to wake some snakes?
喝杯酒嗎？
Dan, would you like a drink?
不用了，謝謝
No, thanks.
拿回你的馬了吧？你的牛呢？
You got your horses back, didn't you?
And your cattle?
拿回我的馬了
Yeah, l got my horses back.
但你殺了我兩頭牛
But you killed two of my herd.
它們死得其所
Well, they died for a good cause.
你知道嗎
You know...
你那兩頭爛牛
them beeves of yours,
拿來喂隻狗都不夠
they wouldn't even have fed a hungry dog.
這樣吧
l tell you what.
這算是賠償吧
That should cover it.
你一天掙多少？
How much you get for a day's work?
做工的時候一天2美金
$2 when l hire out.
這裡就是半天2美金了
Well, there are $2 for a half a day.
你還佔了我孩子們的時間
You took up my boys' time, too.
對
You're right, l did.
還有什麼要賠你的嗎？
Anything else you wanna get paid for, Dan?
再給我5美金
You can give me $5 extra.
那是為什麼
And what's that for?
因為我受驚了
For making me nervous.
手舉起來，班·韋德
Hands up, Ben Wade.
老大！
Boss! Boss!
嘿，老大！
Hey, Boss!
手給我，韋德
Gimme your hands, Mr. Wade.

以儆傚尤
An example made.
我們會花錢促成此事

我還需要三個人
l need three more men.
讓塔克去吧
You can have Tucker.
好
Good.

You only need one.
你受傷了邁克埃爾羅伊先生

我騎著馬來的，當然也能騎著馬走
l rode in here.
Sure as hell can ride out.
他能走，帶上波特一起
He goes, Potter's coming.
什麼？
What?
醫生槍都不會開
Doc can't shoot shit.
我是部隊裡的頭號神槍手
l was best shot in my regiment.
給我……
l'll come...
200美金我就去
for $200.
你是南方軍還是北方軍？
You fight for the North or the South?
北方
North.
我們名義上是南方
We're Southern in name,
但屬於芝加哥了
but Chicago owned.
行，200美金
Fine. $200.
走吧
Let's go.
- 謝謝
- 成事之後再謝我吧

他要在這裡呆多久？
How long does he have to be here?
一小時
An hour...
等到他的手下上鉤
to make sure his outfit takes the bait.
嘿！
Hello, there!
埃文斯！過來幫個忙

你老婆煮的飯
Whatever your wife's cooking in there,

it smells good, Evans.
走吧
Let's go.
警長，車趕得不錯嘛

when you come back, right?
當然
First thing.
走吧
Let's go.
夫人
Ma'am.
拜倫

不是冤家不聚頭啊
what an unpleasant surprise.
如果他們追上馬車會怎麼樣？
What happens if they
catch the wagon?
這個嘛
Well...
你看到他的手下了吧
you saw where his man was.
他還要去找他的手下
He's still gotta go fetch the outfit.
警長的車很快
Marshal's got a fast rig.
天亮之前就能趕到要塞
They should reach
the fort before dawn.
在第六騎兵隊面前，他的手下也不能動手
His gang can't do anything
in front of the whole 6th Cavalry.
這是你幹的嗎？
Did you have something
to do with that?
但願你為你的所作所為感到自豪
l hope you're proud of yourself.
我也是混口飯吃啊，醫生
Just doin' my job, Doc.
謝了
Thanks, son.
我們吃飯之前都要禱告的
We always wait to say grace.
不要冒昧教人禮節
We don't presume to teach

不能替殺人犯說禱告嗎？
Aren't we supposed to say
grace for murderers, too?
任何人都能聽禱告
Grace is for everyone, dear.
- 那為什麼不做呢？
- 馬克
- Then why don't we say it?

我爸願意的話，隨時可以斃了你
lf my pa wants to, he could shoot you dead.
他可以射死50碼外的野兔
He can shoot a jackrabbit at 50 yards.
射動物和殺人是
Shooting an animal's a lot different
非常不一樣的
than, uh, shooting a man, son.
不是啊
No, it isn't.
我覺得
Not in my opinion.
我們可以問問拜倫
We could ask Byron here.
拜倫他殺了幾打幾打的人
Now, Byron, he's killed dozens of people:
無分男女老少
men and women and children,
礦工，印第安人
miners, Apache.
那些人都罪有應得
Not a soul taken
didn't deserve what it got.
「人所行的、在自己眼中都看為正」
Every way of man is right
in his own eyes, Byron.
惟有耶和華衡量人心」

我不愛吃軟骨

不介意我問你為什麼你走路一瘸一拐的吧，丹?
You mind if l ask you how you got
that hitch in your step, Dan?
什麼都別告訴他，埃文斯先生
Don't tell him nothing, Mr. Evans.
你們部隊駐紮在哪裡？
Where were you stationed?
第二連狙擊手，駐紮在麻薩諸塞州的林菲爾德

of how you lost your leg.
子彈轟的？砍掉的？
Did it get shot off, cut off?
印第安人偷了？
The lndians steal it?
草地那邊有什麼在動
There's something moving
out there in the grass.
什麼都沒有
There ain't nothing.
我好像看到什麼東西在山脊那邊
l think l saw something over the ridge.
要是他們追上了馬車那怎麼辦
What if they caught
the coach already?
如果他們早就知道裡面的是克勞利？
What if they already know
it's Crawley inside?
你去過舊金山嗎？
You ever been to San Francisco?
韋德先生，如果你不介意的話
lf it's all right by you, Mr. Wade,
我不想和你說話
l'd rather we not talk.
你沒去過？
So you've never been to San Francisco.
沒
No.
我在那裡認識一個女孩
l knew a girl there.
她是個船長的女兒
She was the daughter
of a sea captain.
她有一雙美麗的綠色眼睛
She had the most
beautiful green eyes,
是我見過最綠的眼睛
about the greenest eyes l ever saw.
就像你的眼睛
Like yours.
我深深地凝視
And l'd stare deep into them.
她的眼睛就會變色
They'd just change color in front of me.
變成了大海的顏色
All the colors of the sea.
你叫什麼來著？
What did you say your name was again?
愛麗絲？
Alice?
愛麗絲
Alice.
天啊
For God's sake.
他殺的人比一場旱災死的人還多
He's killed more men
than the drought.
他不是我想的那樣，他……
He's not what l expected.
He's--
他很危險
He's dangerous.
危險人物，知道嗎
Dangerous is what he is, Alice.
我不想你和孩子們和他說話
l don't want you or the boys talking to him.
你可以改變主意
You can change your mind, Dan.
沒人會瞧不起你
No one will think less of you.
沒人能瞧不起我
No one can think less of me.
6個月之後
Six months from now,
萬物回春
everything's going to be green.
牛兒也會膘肥體壯
The cows are going to be fat.
還可以看到山脊那邊火車噴的煙
We might even see the steam
from the train coming over the ridge.
會好起來的
We'll be all right.
但是如果我不接這個工作
But we won't make it
through the next six days
我們連六天都挨不過
if l don't do this.
抱歉，丹
Sorry, Dan.
邁克埃爾羅伊說五分鐘後出發
McElroy says five minutes.
你覺得我搞不定他？
You think he's too much for me?
他是個殺人凶手
He's a killer, Daniel.
那我們就有義務
Then someone ought
to have the decency
把他正法
to bring him to justice.
你想什麼呢
What are you thinking?
我不是孤軍作戰
l'm not out there alone, you know.
相信我吧
Have a little faith in me.
班·韋德手下有一幫人馬
Ben Wade has a gang,
他們今晚就在外面等著
and they're out there tonight somewhere.
如果我不去，我們一家就得打包滾蛋
lf l don't go, we got
to pack up and leave,
天知道
and God knows where,
我們還有什麼地方可以容身
without a prayer, dirt-poor.
我受夠了
Now l'm tired, Alice.
不想再看著孩子們挨餓了
l am tired of watching
my boys go hungry.
我受不了他們那樣看我
l'm tired of the way
that they look at me.
我也受夠了你對我的漠視
l'm tired of the way that you don't.
三年來
l've been standing on one leg
我靠一條腿奮鬥著
for three damn years,
等著上帝賜我恩惠
waiting for God to do me a favor.
但他充耳不聞
And He ain't listening.
埃文斯先生
Mr. Evans.
不，不，不
Oh, no, no, no, no.
這匹馬歸我了
This is my horse now.
這匹
Come on over here.
這兒
Come on.
在家別搗蛋
Don't you be any trouble, Mark.
- 我不會的
- 好
- Yes, sir.
- All right.
威廉
William.
我想和你們一起去
l want to come with you.
你不行啊
Well, you can't.
我能幫上忙的
l could help.
你才14歲
You're 1 4 years old.
我騎馬也快，打槍也準
Look, l can ride faster and shoot better
勝過他們任何人
than any one of them.
鏢師受傷了，波特根本沒用
The Pinkerton's hurt,
Potter's no good,
鐵路公司的人是個累贅
that railroad man's dead weight,
而那個混蛋……
and that other bastard--
威廉
William.
我沒時間跟你說了
l don't have time to argue.
家裡需要你
別說了
l need you here.
That's that.
就這樣
That's that.
我們這是去哪裡啊?
So, boys, where are we headed?
不管你的事，韋德
Ain't none of your business
where we're headed, Wade.
你是個囚犯
You're a prisoner.
你不准說話，不准撒尿
You don't speak,
you don't piss,
要是沒我們批准，你連他媽呼吸都不可以
you don't goddamn breathe
unless we say so.
明白嗎
You understand that?
我們要帶你去肯塔辛鎮
We're taking you to Contention.
送你上後天3點10分去尤瑪鎮的火車
Putting you on the 3:10 to Yuma
day after tomorrow.
你不該告訴他的
You shouldn't have told him that.
別緊張，哥們
Relax, friend.
如果咱們走散了
我知道該去哪來會合
Now if we get separated,
l know where to meet up.
謝謝你的招待，女士
l'd like to thank you
for your hospitality, ma'am.
希望我能把你丈夫平安送回
Hope l can send
your husband back all right.
他說要送爸平安回來是什麼意思？
What did Ben Wade mean
about sending Pa back all right?
是說要殺了爸爸嗎？
Was he saying he was gonna kill him?
班·韋德連個指頭都不用動
Ben Wade don't have to lift a finger.
他的手下會替他動手
His gang will do it for him.
你父親會照顧好自己的
Your father can take care of himself.
那……
So...
埃文斯先生你是被徵召加入林肯的軍隊的嗎？
were you conscripted
into Lincoln's army, Mr. Evans,
還是你主動參軍的？
or did you volunteer?
都不是
Neither.
可能都是
Maybe both.
那說明什麼？
What does that mean?
說明我當年
Means l was a volunteer
是自願加入麻州的警衛隊
in the Massachusetts State Guard.
到62年的時候
Then, in '62,
聯邦軍隊缺人
the federal government
was running low on men,
就徵召我入伍了
so they called in the state militias
去保衛華盛頓
to protect Washington.
你就是在那裡負傷的
And that's when you got hurt.
你跟來這裡幹嗎？
What are you doing out here, Dan?
你要保護你的家人啊
You got a family to protect.
你不是執法人員
You're not a lawman.
也不是鐵路公司的人
You don't work for the railroad
不像那邊那位鞋子擦得光亮亮的哥們
like Mr. Shiny Shoes over there.
你也不是鏢師
You're not a Pinkerton.
可能我就是無法容忍你這樣的人逍遙法外
Maybe l don't like the idea
of men like you on the loose.
取其所需是人類天性啊
lt's man's nature
to take what he wants, Dan.
我們天生就如此
That's how we're born.
我活的正大光明
Well, l make an honest living.
是啊，但活得也太辛苦了啊
lt might be honest,
but l don't think it's much of a living.
你肯定很缺錢才會接這個工作
You must be hurting bad
for money to take this job.
睡吧
Go to sleep.
我猜，債務讓你的婚姻產生不少矛盾吧
l imagine debt puts
a lot of pressure on a marriage.
你猜？
You imagine?
你知道什麼婚姻？
What would you know about marriage?
不可能所有人都去做土匪強盜
We can't all be cutthroats and thieves.
如果我夠運氣娶到 愛麗絲那樣的老婆
l know if l was lucky enough
to have a wife like Alice,
我一定會好好待她，比你好得多
l'd treat her a whole lot
better than you do, Dan.
我會讓她吃好穿好
l'd feed her better,
buy her pretty dresses,
不用她辛苦工作
wouldn't make her work so hard.
她嫁給你之前肯定很漂亮吧
Yeah, l'll bet Alice was a real pretty girl
before she married you.
閉嘴，別再說我妻子了
Shut up about my wife.
給我閉嘴
You shut up about her.
你再說一個字
You say one more word,
我就剁了你
and l'll cut you down right here.
就在這裡
Right here.
我喜歡你這一面
l like this side of you, Dan.
埃文斯先生
Mr. Evans.
好
Okay.
該換我看守了
lt's my watch now.
我明早將被絞死
They're gonna hang me
in the mornin'
天都還沒亮
Before the night is done
我明早將被絞死
They're gonna hang me
in the mornin'
不復見白日
l'll never see the sun
想要你安靜點恐怕是要求太高了吧
l suppose it's too much
to ask for a little quiet.
如果不是你
The way l figured it
我現在應該躺在自己的床上睡覺
is l'd be asleep
in my own bed right now
都是因為你
if it weren't for you.
如果我沒有覺睡
So if l got to be up,
你也別想睡
well, then, you're damn well
gonna be up with me, too,
班·韋德
Ben Wade.
我明早將被絞死
They're gonna hang me
in the mornin'
天都還沒亮
Before the night is done
我明早將被絞死
Hang me in the mornin'
不復見白日
l'll never see the sun
他媽的
Son of a bitch!
夠了
Enough.
夠了！
Enough!
夠了，邁克埃爾羅伊
That's enough, McElroy.
我們得把他埋了
We have to bury him.
慢慢挖
Take the time to dig one grave,
順便給你自己也挖一個吧
might as well dig one for yourself.
走
Let's go.
上馬
Mount up.
我明早將被絞死
Gonna hang me in the mornin'
不復見白日
l'll never see the sun
別急，老大
Don't you worry there, Boss.
我們馬上救你出去
We're gonna get you
outta there in a second.
查理！
Charlie!
等一下！
Wait! Wait!
薩瑟蘭
Sutherland.
傑克遜
Jackson.
別
No.
別
No.
別這樣
Don't do this.
不要啊
Don't do this.
- 他在哪？
- 開門
- Where is he?
- Open the door.
開門，讓我出去，媽的
Open the door.
Let me outta here, God damn it.
- 他們帶他去哪了？
- 我不知道啊
- Where did they take him?
- l don't know.
先生……
Mister...
你最好
you better tell me...
告訴我他們帶他去哪了
where they took him...
不然你就燒成炭了
or you will burn.
肯塔辛鎮！行了吧？！
Contention.
All right?
他們要去肯塔辛鎮
They're going to Contention.
他們要送他上3點10分開往
尤瑪鎮的押解列車，明天
They're gonna put him
on the 3:10 to Yuma Prison tomorrow.
放我出去！
Let me outta here!
肯塔辛鎮
Contention is...
要反方向往回走80英里
80 miles back the other way.
我們的馬會吃不消的
We'd have to about kill our horses.
馬累死了再買新的
So we'll buy new ones.
查理…
Charlie...
被抓到都怪他自己
it's his own fault he got caught.
自食其果
He made a mistake.
你覺得自己當頭兒更合適？
You think you could do
a better job leading this crew?
有可能
Maybe.
你別忘了他為我們做過什麼
You forgotten what he done for us.
我們去肯塔辛
We're going to Contention.
別說我沒警告過你
Can't say I didn't warn you.
這裡有條近路可以走
There's a shortcut we could take.
近路？
Shortcut?
穿隧道
Through the pass.
直通肯塔辛
Takes you right through to Contention.
你怎麼不早說？
Why didn't you say something before?
那是印第安人的地盤
That's Apache country.
土地是政府給他們的
I thought the government gave them land.
這裡有人不想從那走
These are the ones refused to go.
要是我就不會從那走
I wouldn't take that pass.
哦，你當然想我們走遠路了
Oh, you'd like us to take the long way?
- 沒錯
- 然後讓你的弟兄們追上來
- That's right.
- And let your boys catch us?
巴特菲先生，那裡的印第安人
Mr. Butterfield, the Apache
that live in that pass
都是負隅頑抗的一群
are the ones that stayed to fight.
他們嗜血成性
They enjoy killing.
你過不去的
You ain't gonna make it.
我們博一下
We'll take our chances.
你想什麼呢，丹？
Something on your mind, Dan?
你為什麼殺的是塔克？
Why'd you kill Tucker?
為什麼不是我？
Why not me?
或是巴特菲？
Or Butterfield?
因為塔克奪了我的馬
Well, Tucker took my horse.
你喜歡他嗎，丹？
Did you like him, Dan?
不喜歡
No.
他燒掉了你的穀倉
He told me he burnt down your barn.
他是個混蛋
He was an asshole...
但咒他去死和動手殺他
but wishing him dead and killing him
可不是一回事
are two different things.
你還真是有良心啊，丹
Your conscience is sensitive, Dan.
我可沒你那麼道義昂然
I don't think it's my favorite part of you.
少說兩句，韋德先生
Button it up, Mr. Wade.
想找人聊天，找我
You wanna talk to somebody,
talk to me.
我不想跟你聊，拜倫
I don't like talking to you, Byron.
我手裡有槍的時候就不想了吧
Not when I have the gun.
不，不因為那個
No, that ain't it.
我只是覺得你很沒勁
I just don't find you that interesting.
笑吧，醫生
Laugh it up, Doc,
等你落他手上就知道了
till he guts you like a fish.
拜倫就像一首沒變調的歌曲
Byron's like a song with one note.
你就沒讀過別的書嗎，拜倫？
You ever read another book
in your life, Byron,
除了聖經之外
besides the Bible?
沒必要
No need.
拜倫虔誠得很啊
Byron acts pious.
幾年前，當他受雇去中部的時候
Few years ago, when he was
under contract to Central,
我親眼見他和另外幾個鏢師
I seen him and a bunch of other Pinks
砍死了32個印第安婦孺小孩
mow down 32 Apache
women and children.
那都是些異教徒…
Renegades...
射殺鐵路工人和他們的家眷
gunning down railroad men
and their families.
一個一個從路上劫下來
Picking 'em off the road one by one.
扒下他們的皮
Scalping 'em.
那裡還有小孩子四處哭喊尖叫
There was young ones running
around crying and screaming.
都不到三歲
No more than three years old.
他的手下把他們都殺了
扔在山溝裡
And his boys shot 'em all
then pushed 'em into a ditch.
有些還在哭喊
Some of them was still crying.
我猜拜倫以為上帝不會介意
But I guess Byron figured
that Jesus wouldn't mind.
反正上帝也不喜歡印第安人
Apparently Jesus don't like the Apache.
接著說…
Keep on talking...
一路說到尤瑪
all the way to Yuma,
一步步登上台階
right up them steps,
繫上繩索
to the rope,
直赴地獄
straight to Hell.
等我死那天，拜倫
Day I die, Byron,
我將從地獄復活
I'm getting sprung from Hell.
我也會這麼覺得
I might feel the same,
如果我也是
if I come from the seed
爛醉的掘墓人
of a drunk gravedigger
跟妓女生的
and the rancid womb of a whore.
扔了槍，丹·埃文斯…埃文斯
Drop it, Dan Evans.
扔了
Drop it.
把槍撂地上，醫生
Toss that to the ground, Doc.
巴特菲先生
Mr. Butterfield.
我猜，丹
Now I believe, Dan,
你還帶了一把手槍
you're carrying a pistol as well.
希望你能把它拿出來
I'd appreciate it if you take that out
然後扔在地上
謝謝合作
and drop it on the ground.
Thank you.
我一直挺喜歡你的，拜倫
Now, I always liked you, Byron.
但你總是喋喋不休
But you never knew
when to shut up.
壞人也敬愛他們的母親
Even bad men love their mamas.
我看是時候讓大家回家了
Now I think it's time
for everybody to go home.
不許動，韋德先生
Don't you move, Mr. Wade.
放下獵槍
Let go of that shotgun.
威廉…
William...
你怎麼來了
what the hell
are you doing here?
我可不信你會在背後
Now, I don't think
you gonna shoot a man
對一個你崇拜的人開槍
you admire in the back
of the head, boy.
丹，告訴你兒子已經結束了
Dan, tell your boy it's over.
你覺得你能拿槍對著他，威廉？
You think you can keep
your gun on him, William?
我瞄得可比你準
I'm doing a damn sight
better than you did.
你有去過道奇城嗎？
You ever been to Dodge City?
沒去過
No.
別跟他廢話
Stop talking to him.
你洗牌的手法
The way you're shuffling those cards,
我覺得很專業
I took you for a pro.
我練過
I practice a lot.
看出來了
I can tell.
你有去過道奇嗎？
You ever been to Dodge?
當然去過
Yes, indeed.
最邪惡骯髒又美麗的城市
Meanest, most beautiful
dirty city there ever was.
酒館裡擠滿了
Saloon was just overflowing
偷牲口賊，劫匪
with cattle drivers, and road agents,
淘金者，歹徒
prospectors, gunslingers,
賭徒還有女人
gamblers, and women.
能讓你神魂顛倒的女人
Women who'll do things to you
you'll never forget.
讓你染病的女人
They'll give you a disease you'll never forget.
在道奇城只要荷包裡有錢
Money in your pocket in Dodge City,
你就要什麼有什麼
you can have everything
a man ever wished for.
想什麼有什麼
Everything a man comes to need.
我去那年跟你差不多大
I got there on my own as a boy
not much bigger than you.
自從那以後你殺了多少人，韋德？
And how many men
you killed since then, Wade?
毀了多少家庭？
How many families you destroyed?
相當多
Quite a few.
你真的去年在西部
Is it true that you dynamited
炸掉了一輛滿載淘金者的馬車嗎？
a wagon full of prospectors
in the Western Territories last spring?
沒有，那是謠言
No, that's a lie.
實際上是一火車
It was a train full.
行了，丹…
Well, Dan...
我要去撒泡尿
I gotta take a piss.
我還真以為他會在溪谷那裡
You know, I thought
he was gonna shoot me
打死我
back at the ravine.
我真以為他會這麼做
I really thought
he was gonna do it.
他眼裡有一種野性
You know, there's
a wildness in his eyes.
- 讓我想起了…
- 他跟你不一樣，韋德
- It reminds me of...
- He's gonna be nothing like you, Wade.
威廉生來就有正義感
William's got a head start
on the path of decency.
沒錯，所以我從不
Yeah, that's why I don't mess around
擋好人的路，丹
with doing anything good, Dan.
你為別人做一件好事
You do one good deed
for somebody...
我想就會養成習慣
I imagine it's habit-forming.
是好事
Something decent.
看到他們眼中充滿感激
See that grateful look in their eyes,
讓你覺得自己就像上帝
imagine it makes you feel
like Christ Hisself.
好啦，我聽夠了，韋德
All right, I had enough
of this, Wade.
快走
Come on, let's go.
威廉！
William!
- 那有三個人
- 你的人？
- There's three of 'em.
- Yours?
要是我的人，你早死了
If they were mine, you'd be dead.
把槍給我，韋德
Give me that gun, Wade.
韋德？
Wade?
韋德！
Wade!
我說過別走這條路
I told you not to come this way.
那是邁克埃爾羅伊的決定
It was McElroy's decision.
我就說過會有麻煩
I told you there'd be trouble.
給我手銬的鑰匙
Give me the keys to the handcuffs.
放鬆…
Easy...
放鬆些
Easy now.
他在哪兒？
Where is he?
他跑了
He's gone.
他帶著馬跑了
我在草叢裡找到的
He took the horses with him.
I found this in the grass.
從哪兒走能快點離開這裡？
What's the quickest way
out of the pass?
他會想辦法弄掉手銬
He'll be looking for help getting his cuffs off.
我們去追他？
We're going after him?
把他押解到半路
Well, there ain't no reward
可是沒有獎金的吧？
for getting him halfway
to that train, is there?
說老實話
I got to be honest with y'all.
我還挺喜歡他們的飯菜
I like some of their food.
但是要花40塊一個月
As for wanting $40 a month, now,
就像北方的那些愛爾蘭人…
like them Irish up north...
該死的苦力
Goddamn Coolies.
不給點顏色就不好好幹活
They'll work just fine
with my left boot up their ass.
要是能教會猴子鋪鐵軌…
Well, if could teach
a monkey to lay track...
我們這裡真需弄些黑鬼來，鮑斯先生
Well, what we need
is some Negroes
brung in here, Mr. Boles.
讓這些中國人看看什麼叫作工
Show these Chinamen
what real work is.
上帝啊
Holy Christ.
- 那是誰？
- 是他
- Who's that?
- That's him.
你，幫我一把
You, help me with the handcuffs.
把鐵鏈撬開
Break the chain.
用錘子，撬開鐵鏈
Use the hammer.
Break the chain.
我們外面有五桿槍對著你，班·韋德！
I got five guns on you
out here, Ben Wade!
束手就擒吧！
Best come on out!
是我們的馬
Our horses.
這是怎麼回事？
What in the hell's going on here?
巴特菲先生，巴士比公幹完了？
Mr. Butterfield, all finished in Bisbee?
鮑斯先生
Mr. Boles.
最好快點，我們這周就炸最後一響了
Better hurry. We're making the last blasts
through the mountains this week.
這是我的犯人
That's my prisoner.
我們帶他去肯塔辛
送他上去尤瑪的押解火車
I'm taking him to Contention,
putting him on the prison train to Yuma.
什麼犯人？
What prisoner?
得了，鮑斯
Come now, Mr. Boles,
你抓到的是班·韋德
that's Ben Wade you have there.
班·韋德當著我的面
Ben Wade gunned down my kid brother
殺了我弟弟
in front of me
六年前就在阿比林
six years ago in Abilene.
你弟弟是個出老千的騙子
Your brother was a lyin', bilkin' card sharp.
如果沒記錯的話
That is, if he's the asshole I remember.
也有可能是別的什麼
我幹掉的混帳
Could, of course, been some other
asshole I killed that I forgot about.
你不能那麼幹
那不道德
You can't do that.
That's immoral.
道德與這無關
Moral ain't got a damn thing to do with it.
我還指望靠這個人得到200塊的獎金呢
I was expecting to collect
a $200 reward for that man.
我要押他去肯塔辛
I'm delivering him to Contention.
我需要那筆錢
I need that money.
死了都想要？
Need it bad enough to die?
那至少讓我們拿回馬匹吧
Well, at least let us take our horses.
那沒問題…
I got no problem with that...
只要你拍屁股走人，先生
as long as you ride away, mister.
很高興認識你，丹
Nice knowing you, Dan.
看到我用鐵鍬拍他了嗎？
Did you see me get that one
with the shovel?
醫生
Doc.
醫生！
Doc!
丹！
Dan!
該死的！
God damn it!
我們成功了嗎？
Did we make it?
我們脫身了嗎？
Did we get away?
是的，醫生
Yeah, Doc.
我們成功了
We did.
多虧了你
Thanks to you.
我們得找個地方避避風頭
We need a place to lay low.
火車來之前讓他暫時消失
Keep him outta sight
till the train comes.
那邊有個旅店
There's a hotel up here.
我去開間房，你們轉到後面去
I'll check us in.
You ride around back.
好的，跟我來
All right.
Follow me.
你們好，先生們
Hello, gentlemen.
嘿，威廉，你去車站盯著
Hey, William, you go keep
a watch at the railhead.
如果看他們來了…
If you see them coming...
我會讓你知道
I'll let you know.
威廉
And William?
現在這裡有康康舞表演
如果你想看的話
There's a Can-Can on the hour
if you're interested.
這是新婚套房
It's the bridal suite.
希望你不介意
就剩這一間了
Hope you don't mind.
It's all they had.
很好，很好
Well, well.
看來巴士比要下雨了
That looks like rain clouds over Bisbee.
你還需要那200塊嗎，丹？
You still need that $200, Dan?
閉嘴
Shut up.
埃文斯先生，你一直讓我充滿信心
Mr. Evans, you continue
to give me great confidence.
但是，還沒到3點10分
Well, it ain't 3:10 yet.
我去看看警長
I'm gonna go see about the marshal.
快，快，走
Come on, move.
Let's go.
我們在找一夥押送
We're looking for a group escorting an outlaw
一個叫班·韋德的匪徒的人
by the name of Ben Wade.
是，我們一直追到這個山洞
Yeah, we been chasing him
through these tunnels.
你們是誰？
Who are you?
追他們幹嘛？
What's it to you?
班·韋德殺了我弟弟
Ben Wade killed my brother.
那你弟弟一定很有名
Then your brother must be famous.
你們真像一群烏合之眾
You boys some kind of posse?
我討厭烏合之眾
I hate posses.
那這還真是新婚套房了
So this is the bridal suite.
真不知道有多少新娘在這裡躺過
Now, I wonder how many brides
have taken in this view.
你打算怎麼花那200塊錢，丹？
What are you gonna do
with your $200 now, Dan?
現在雨快來了
Now that the rains are coming?
我欠別人錢，韋德
I owe people money, Wade.
我走投無路
That drought left me in the hole.
我出雙倍的價錢怎麼樣？
Well, what do you think
about double that amount?
你可以還清欠款
You could pay your debts,
再買個百十來頭牛
buy a hundred more cows,
蓋他一座新穀倉
build a new barn.
你打算讓我怎麼做？
How you reckon
I'm gonna do that?
只要放下槍，讓我走
Just lay down your gun
and let me walk out the door.
對我來說值400塊
It's worth $400 to me.
你覺得我就值這個價？
Is that what you reckon my price is?
不
No.
不，我覺得你值一千塊
No, I reckon it's a thousand.
一千塊錢
$1,000.
這可比巴特菲運鈔車裡的錢多十倍
Now, there's 10 times that amount
in Butterfield's coach.
哦，是嗎？
Oh, yeah?
你希望我被絞死，丹？
You want my cut, Dan?
你說了算
It's all yours.
人算不如天算吧，韋德
Isn't that kind of reckless of you, Wade?
或者說，嗯…
Seeing as, uh...
你就那麼肯定，嗯
you're so sure that, uh,
你的同夥會來救你？
your crew's coming to get you?
哦，他們正趕來呢，丹
Oh, they're coming, Dan.
上帝為證，他們來了
Sure as God's vengeance,
they're coming.
但我喜歡簡單點
But I just like to do things easy.
想想你都能用一千塊幹什麼，丹
Imagine what you could do
with a thousand dollars, Dan.
你可以請些幫工
You could hire
a couple of ranch hands.
你的孩子們可以去唸書，長聰明
Your boys could go to school,
grow up smart.
還有愛麗絲呢？
What about Alice?
她會成為一個亞利桑那州優秀農場主的夫人
She would be the proud wife
of a bona fide Arizona rancher.
你只要說同意
All you got to do is say yes.
那麼…
Well...
你是要給我張支票呢，韋德？
would you give me a bank note, Wade?
還是你好人做到底
親自去提款給我？
Or maybe you'd be kind enough
to make a deposit for me.
現金
Cash.
那你告訴我，韋德
Well, you... you tell me, Wade.
我該如何儲蓄
How would I account for...
那麼一筆錢？
for that amount of money?
我花的時候怎麼跟別人說錢哪兒來的？
And what would I tell people
when I spend it?
就說，嗯…
That, uh...
就說你從我手上
That you got the jump on me,
跑了，然後我就交了好運？
you escaped, and somehow I got a fortune?
不，你以為人家都是傻子啊
No. How dumb do you think people are?
沒人需要知道
Nobody needs to know.
我說
You know what?
能不能幫個忙
Would you do me a favor?
別跟我說話
Don't talk to me for a while.
就是說我們還是不能成為朋友？
You mean we're still not friends?
不能
No.
不能，我們不是
No, we're not.
等差五分三點的時候
Come five minutes to three,
我們到時候可就會親密得多了
we're gonna be a hell
of a lot closer than you think.
我明早將被絞死
They're gonna hang me
In the mornin'
在黎明之前
Before the night is done
我明早將被絞死
They're gonna hang me
In the mornin'
不復見白日
I'll never see the sun
誰啊?
Who is it?
是我，丹
It's me, Dan.
我帶幫手來了
I brought help.
你可去了好久啊，巴特菲先生
You been gone a long time,
Mr. Butterfield.
我怎麼知道你有沒有被人挾持？
How do I know somebody
ain't got a gun on you out there?
丹，這是是警長威爾·多尼
Dan, this is Marshal Will Doane.
- 警長
- 埃文斯先生
- Marshal.
- Mr. Evans.
這是我兩個最得力的手下
哈維·佩爾…
Two of my finest men:
Harvey Pell...
山姆·福勒
Sam Fuller.
真是不好意思，警長
I'm sorry about all that, Marshal.
- 真的很感激你能幫忙
- 別說了
- I really am grateful for the help.
- Don't mention it.
你真覺得能幫忙把我送上車？
So you fellas really gonna
help put me on this train?
我不這麼看，韋德先生
It may not seem like it, Mr. Wade,
但我們這座鎮上還有法律與秩序
就像其它地方一樣
but we got law and order in this town,
just like any other.
這可真讓然放心啊，警長
Well, that's very reassuring, Marshal.
巴特菲出多少錢？
How much is Butterfield paying you?
不關你的事
That's none of your business.
你跟我們一起走嗎？
You gonna come with us?
我跟你們一路走到底
Oh, I'll be walking with you...
every step of the way.
你可以相信我，丹
You have my word on that, Dan.
那麼我們有五個人
五是個吉利數字
So there's five of us.
Five is good.
還不夠
It ain't enough.
遠遠不夠
It ain't nearly enough.
- 爸！
- 是我兒子
- Pa!
- That's my boy.
他們來了
They're coming.
他們朝這邊來了
我看見了
They're coming this way.
I seen 'em.
- 哪兒？
- 大約一里外，跟我們走的是一條路
- Where?
- About a mile out. Same way we come.
- 有多少人？
- 七個，要麼八個
- How many are there?
- Seven. Eight.
到底多少？
七個還是八個？
Which is it, boy?
Seven or eight?
七個
Seven.
夥計們，不好意思打擾了
Folks, sorry to bother you,
但我需要你們都到外面去
but I'm gonna need you all
to move outside
越快越好
as quickly as possible.
好了，夥計們
That's it, folks.
謝謝合作
Thank you very much.
行了，快走，夥計們
That's it.
Move along, folks.
快走
Move along.
快，立刻
Come on, now!
嘿！別當路！
Hey! Get out of my way!
就這裡
Right there.
人不少
There sure are a lot of 'em.
沒想到會全來了
I didn't figure on it
being the whole gang.
老大
Boss.
老大？
Boss?
老大，你在嗎？
Boss, you in there?
你想我怎麼回答？
What do you want me to tell him?
你告訴他們，你會在尤瑪每天給他們寫信的
You tell him you'll write him
a letter every day from Yuma.
你小心點，韋德
You be careful, Wade.
查理，兄弟們
Charlie. Boys.
嗨，老大
- Hey, Boss.
- Yeah?
查理，帶夥計們去酒館
Charlie, why don't you take the boys
買杯酒喝吧
down to the saloon
and buy 'em a drink.
你沒事吧？
You okay?
哦，我很好，我正跟我四個
新認識的朋友坐這聊天呢
Oh, I'm fine. I'm just sittin' up here
with my four new friends.
嘿…
Hey...
夠了
That's enough.
謝謝你，查理，夥計們
Thank you, Charlie. Boys.
聽著！
Listen up!
聽著！
Listen up!
上面那個是班·韋德
That's Ben Wade
they have up there.
班·韋德！
Ben... Wade!
現在
Now...
鐵路公司意圖
the Railroad intends...
把他送上三點十分去尤瑪的牢車
to put him on the 3:10 to Yuma...
然後絞死他
and hang him.
他要幹什麼？
What's he doing?
誰要是能射殺一個守衛
We will give you 200 cash dollars
就可以得到200塊現金
to any man who shoots
any one of his captors.
多少？
How much?
保證200塊現鈔
200 cash dollars guaranteed!
保證200塊現鈔！
$200 guaranteed!
- 就在這，我保證
- 傳過去
- Right here. You got me.
- Hand it over.
跟你說，先生
I'll tell you now, mister.
我要這200塊
給我錢
I'll take 200.
Give me the money.
你得先射中才算數
Well, you gotta shoot 'em first.
這外面有30到40多人
There's gotta be 30, 40
more guns out there now.
哦，真他媽見鬼
Oh, to hell with this.
- 等一下，警長
- 你看，你看
- Now just a minute, Marshal.
- Look, look.
如果兩邊勢均力敵，那沒問題
If it's a fair fight, well, sure.
我會留下
I'd stay for that.
勢均力敵，那是
A fair fight, that...
我們的職責所在，但是…
That's a man's duty, but...
我們只有五個人
there's only five of us.
對不起，先生
I'm sorry, mister,
但我今天不想死在這
but I'm not gonna die here today.
我的手下也不想
And neither are my men.
警長…
Marshal...
你忘了這個
forgot this.
警長…
Marshal...
警長！
警長，到底…
Marshal!
Marshal, what's the...
現在，你看，丹…
Now, you see, Dan...
看樣子，大家都很惜命麼
generally, pretty much
everyone wants to live.
- 我再多出一倍
- 我們走，夥計們
- I'll double your money.
- Let's go, boys.
你真想看我們血賤街頭嗎？
Please. Do you wanna see us
shot down in the street?
巴士比就發生過
This thing happened in Bisbee.
巴特菲也不例外
That means Butterfield, too.
幹嘛把麻煩帶到肯塔辛來？
Why bring your troubles to Contention?
我們都有家事，大家都是有家室的人
We've got families.
Every one of us is a family man.
我也是有家室的人
I'm a family man, too.
他會離你而去
He's gonna walk out on you.
你最好像我們一樣罷手吧
Then you best get out
like the rest of us.
他會回來
He's gonna come back up here,
然後離你而去
and he's gonna walk out on you.
現在你該想的是
Now what you gotta figure
is why you and your boy
你跟你兒子何苦要送死
are gonna die.
就因為巴特菲的鐵路公司損失了點錢？
Because Butterfield's railroad
lost some money?
都死了？
Is that all of 'em?
- 快進來！
- 叫醫生啊！
- Get inside!
- Get a doctor!
差不多
Almost.
看你的了，將軍
Your move, General.
你想讓他回答什麼？
What do you expect him to say?
我想讓他回答得有道理
I expect him to say something
that makes sense.
能讓你倆得救
Something that might
save the two of you.
看看吧，丹
Take a look, Dan.
怎麼了？
你不想看？
What's the matter?
You don't wanna see?
我一會兒就看
I'll see 'em soon enough.
你能，孩子？你想看看嗎？
What about you, kid?
You wanna look?
離窗子遠點，威廉
You stay away from
the window, William.
快，看看吧
Go on, take a look.
都是野獸
Animals, all of 'em.
康普思，警戒
傑克遜，後門
Campos, stand guard.
Jackson, back door.
他們會殺了你跟你父親，威廉
They're gonna kill you
and your father, William.
他們會邊笑邊動手
They're gonna laugh while they do it.
我猜你也清楚
I think you know that.
叫他們罷手
Call 'em off.
為什麼？
Why should I?
因為你並不真壞
Because you're not all bad.
我是真壞
Yes, I am.
你從那些印第安人手裡救了我們
You saved us from those Indians.
我救的是我自己
I saved myself.
你幫我們穿過了隧道
You got us through the tunnels.
你幫我們脫了身
You helped us get away.
如果在隧道裡我有槍
If I'd had a gun in them tunnels,
肯定會用在你身上
I would have used it on you.
我不相信
I don't believe you.
小子，我要不是窮凶極惡
Kid, I wouldn't last five minutes
leading an outfit like that
面對那麼一群人，我五分鐘都撐不住
if I wasn't as rotten as hell.
丹？
Dan?
我做不到，丹
I can't do it, Dan.
如果我做不到
你也不該做
And if I can't do it,
you shouldn't do it, either.
他們說識時務者為俊傑
They say discretion
is the better part of valor.
如果你覺得對我
If you think you have
an obligation to me
或是鐵路公司有責任
or to the Railroad,
我保證，你沒有
我放棄
I assure you, you do not.
I'm releasing you.
就剩你了，丹
It's just you left, Dan.
就剩你跟你兒子了
Just you and your boy.
也許他說得對，爸
也許我們該回家
Maybe he's right, Pa.
Maybe we should go home.
那樣的話，波特醫生的死是為了什麼？
Well, what did Doc Potter
give his life for, William?
還有邁克埃爾羅伊
And McElroy?
他們的爛命，就如同小紅蟻般的死不足惜
Little red ants on a hill.
我付你200塊錢，丹，馬上
I'll pay you the 200, Dan, right now,
這樣你就可以罷手了吧
and you can walk away.
你知道嗎，一路上
You know, this whole ride,
這一直讓我很火大
that's been nagging on me.
政府也為了我的腿，給了我這個金額
That's what the government
gave me for my leg.
198塊3毛6
$198.36.
有趣的是
And the funny thing is that...
你回想起來，我最近經常想
when you think about it,
which I have been lately,
這錢是給我讓我能走開的嗎？
was they weren't paying me
to walk away.
還是為了他們可以自己走開
They were paying me
so they could walk away.
往時不同今日，丹
Don't muddy the past
and the present, Dan.
不、不、不，韋德
No, no, no, Wade.
就是這麼回事
I'm seeing the world the way it is.
如果你要送他上車，爸
我跟你去
If you take him to the train, Pa,
I'm going with you.
不，巴特菲先生會帶你回家
No, Mr. Butterfield's
gonna take you home.
- 不要，我不跟他走
- 你要跟他走
- No, I'm not going anywhere with him.
- Yes, you are.
我跟你呆在這
I'm staying here with you.
你去隔壁找個房間
You're gonna hold up
in a room across the hall.
等我們走了再走
You're gonna wait until we leave.
我會帶他回巴士比，丹
我要你保證
I'll get him to Bisbee, Dan.
I promise you.
好的，我要你保證更多事情
Oh, you're gonna promise me
a lot more than that, Butterfield.
我要確保郝蘭德和他的手下們
I want guarantees that Hollander
and his boys
永遠不會再踏上我的土地一步
will never set foot
on my land again,
水要重新流過來
and that my water's gonna flow.
我還希望你當面把1000塊交到我老婆手上
And I expect you to hand my wife
1,000 cash dollars when you see her.
你手上有足夠的資金
You got money to spare.
我能做到
I can deliver that.
只要把他送上車
Just get him on the train.
你聽見了？
You heard him?
我聽見了
I heard him.
威廉，我要你把這個交給你媽
William, I want you
to give this back to your mother.
你跟她說這東西幫我分清了黑白
I want you to tell her that it helped me
find what was right.
爸…
Pa...
我辨不到
I can't.
我不能就這樣離開你
I can't just leave you.
我過一天就會追上你，威廉
I'm gonna be a day
behind you, William.
除非意外，否則肯定會
Unless something happens,
and if it does,
我需要有人打理農場
I need a man at the ranch
to run things,
保護家人，而我清楚你能做到
protect our family, and I know
that you can do that
因為你已經成了一個好人，威廉
because you've become
a fine man, William.
你成了個好人，遺傳了我最好的部分
You've become a fine man.
You got all the best parts of me.
這地方就缺這個
What few there are.
你一定要記住，你老爸…
And you just remember
that your old man
在無人能為的情況下
walked Ben Wade to that station
把班·韋德押到了車站
when nobody else would.
你把表搗碎了也不能讓時間停止
You know, squeezing that watch
won't stop time.
別太害怕，你可能會忙中出錯
Don't get so scared.
You might back a bad move.
你讀過聖經嗎，丹？
You ever read the Bible, Dan?
我就讀過一次
I read it one time.
當時我八歲
I was eight years old.
我爸死在一杯威士忌酒上
My daddy just got hisself
killed over a shot of whiskey,
我媽媽說「我們回東部去從頭開始」
and my mama said,
"We're going back East to start over."
於是她給我一本聖經
So she gave me a Bible,
把我放在火車站，讓我讀
sat me down in the train station,
told me to read it.
她說去買票
She was gonna get our tickets.
於是我照她說的
Well, I did what she said.
把聖經從頭讀到尾
I read that Bible
from cover to cover.
花了整整三天時間
It took me three days.
她再沒回來
She never came back.
是時候了
It's time.
火車站離這有半英里，丹
It's a half mile
to the station from here, Dan.
我猜要走著去了
I guess we're walking.
他在這！
There he is!
去把他弄出來
Go and flush him out!
上啊
Let's get to it.
好狗運
Lucky.
丹
Dan.
謝了
Thanks.
走
Move.
快！
Come on!
看來用不上那些暴徒了，查理
Might not get a chance
to use those Scofields, Charlie.
你是不是能跟我說說你的計劃，丹
Perhaps you can explain to me
the next portion of your plan, Dan.
我抓到他了
I think I got him!
嘿，嘿！
Hey. Hey!
不要打黑帽子！
Not the black hat!
打農夫，你個笨球
The rancher,
you dumb-shits!
農夫，農夫…
The rancher!
The ranch...
查理！
Charlie!
回來！回來！
Get back! Get back!
老大
Boss.
老大！
Boss!
走
Let's go.
那扇白門，走！
The white door.
Move it!
好
All right.
我不幹了，丹
I ain't doing this
no more, Dan.
我要送你上那趟車，韋德
I'm getting you
on that train, Wade.
你兒子回去了！
Your son went back!
孩子走了，英雄
The boy's gone, hero.
沒人看了
Ain't nobody watching no more.
你還有一條好腿
You still got that one good leg.
幹嘛不用它走回家
Why don't you use it
to get on home?
查理！
Charlie!
查理·王子！
Charlie Prince!
是，老大！
Yeah, Boss!
別開槍
Hold your fire.
- 我出來了
- 別開槍！
- I'm walking out.
- Hold your fire!
我從沒當過英雄，韋德
I ain't never been no hero, Wade.
我見過的唯一一場戰鬥，我們在撤退
The only battle I seen,
we was in retreat.
我的腿是被自己人打斷的
My foot got shot off
by one of my own men.
你跟你孩子講講這個故事
You try telling that story to your boy.
看他們到時候怎麼看你
See how he looks at you then.
老大！老大！
Boss! Boss!
好吧，丹
Okay, Dan.
孩子
Son.
他們在屋頂上！
They're on the roofs!
他們在屋頂上！
They're on the roofs!
老大！
Boss!
老大！跳啊！
Boss! Drop!
- 你能行嗎？
- 行
- Can you make this?
- Yeah.
起來
Come on.
起來！
Come on!
走！快跑！
Go! Run!
分散！
Spread out!
幾點了？
What time is it?
快三點10分了
About 10 past 3.
三點十分去尤瑪的車呢？
Where's the 3:10 to Yuma?
我猜遲到了
Running late, I suppose.
有多遲？
How late?
打我吧
Beats me.
到的時候自然就到了
Gets here when it gets here.
該死的火車，永遠不能相信，啊？
Goddamn trains.
Never can rely on 'em, huh?
窗邊！
By the window!
你知道
You know...
不是我頑固
I ain't stubborn.
你說啥？
Excuse me?
你說我頑固
You said I was stubborn
讓家人生活在一個沒救的農場裡
for keeping my family
on a dying ranch.
是因為我兒子馬克
It's my son Mark.
小的那個？
The young one?
他兩歲時得了結核
He got tuberculosis when he was 2.
醫生說如果沒有乾燥的天氣
The doctor said he'd die
他就死定了，所以…
if he didn't have a dry climate, so...
你幹嘛告訴我這些？
Why are you telling me this?
我不知道
I don't know.
我猜我只是…
I guess I just...
想告訴你我並不頑固
wanted you to know
that I ain't stubborn is all.
既然大家都這麼坦誠相待
Well, as long as we're
making confessions...
嗯？
Yeah?
我以前也進過尤瑪監獄
I've been to Yuma Prison before.
兩次
Twice.
也逃出來兩次
Escaped twice, too.
第一節車廂，拉門
First car, sliding door.
他們會出來
They'll be coming!
好！
Yeah!
我這有個要送去尤瑪的犯人
I got a prisoner to go to Yuma!
你做到了，丹
Well, you did it, Dan.
不！
No!
爸
Pa.
對一個瘸子農夫來說
For a one-leg rancher...
他可算是個硬漢
he's one tough son of a bitch.
對
Yeah.
你做到了，爸
You done it, Pa.
你做到了
You done it.
你送他上了去尤瑪的車
You got him on the train.
Pa.
