1
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,700
...f (x)/2 dx.

2
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:43,920
So please finish Percival
for next time.

3
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:49,330
I know many of you had this as
undergraduates, but it won't hurt to brush up.

4
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,000
Thank you, Steven.

5
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:59,900
I also put an advanced Fourier system
on the main hallway chalkboard.

6
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:02,770
I'm hoping that one of you might
prove it by the end of the semester.

7
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,840
Now the person to do so will
not only be in my good graces...

8
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:09,010
but also go on
to fame and fortune...

9
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,180
by having their accomplishment
recorded and their name printed...

10
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,280
in the auspicious M.I.T. Tech.

11
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:18,890
Former winners include Nobel laureates,
Field's medal winners...

12
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:23,690
renowned astrophysicists
and lowly M.I.T. professors.

13
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:27,130
Well, that's all.
If you have any questions...

14
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,700
I'm sure that Tom
has the answers.

15
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:08,100
Hi, Will.

16
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:10,170
- Kirsten, how you doing?
- I'm all right. How are you?

17
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,440
- Good.
- I didn't get on Cathy last night.

18
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:14,710
- No?
- No.

19
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,240
- Why not?
- I don't know.

20
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,610
- Cathy!
- What?

21
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,150
Why didn't you give me none of that
nasty little hoochie-woochie...

22
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:23,550
- you usually throw at me?
- Oh, fuck you...

23
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,020
and your Irish curse,
Chuckie.

24
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:30,020
Like I'd waste my energy spreadin'
my legs for that Tootsie Roll dick?

25
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:33,490
- Go home and give it a tug yourself.
- Tootsie Roll!

26
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,560
T- Toots!

27
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:38,900
She's missin' a tooth,
Will.

28
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,930
She's got skin problems.
I don't...

29
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,100
Plus, it's like 5-to-2 Morgan ends up
marryin' her, you know what I mean?

30
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:47,770
There's only so many times you can
bang your friend's future wife.

31
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,410
It's wrong.
Where you goin'?

32
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:54,980
- I'm gonna take off.
- Fuck you, you're takin' off. It's, like, what, 10:00?

33
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,280
No, I'm tired.

34
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,520
Irish curse?

35
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:04,460
She don't know.
There ain't no Irish curse.

36
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:14,760
Out! Stop
pressuring me back.

37
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:19,030
Stop crowding the plate!
Which one will it be?

38
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,730
You're gonna get charged,
you know that?

39
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,300
You think I'm afraid of you, you big
fuck? You're crowdin' the fuckin' plate.

40
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:31,940
Hey, uh, Casey's bouncin' up a bar at
Harvard next week. We should go up there.

41
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:34,170
- What are we gonna do up there?
- I don't know.

42
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,280
We'll fuck up some smart kids.
Probably fit right in.

43
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:42,850
Ow! Fuckin' punk.

44
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:47,220
- Oh, what's up? You still tough?
- Come on!

45
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:49,120
Come on. Come on.
That's it.

46
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:55,930
# I'd hold you forever
here #

47
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,630
# In my arms #

48
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,630
- Professor Lambeau?
- Yes?

49
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:05,100
I'm in your applied theories class. We're
all up at the math and science building.

50
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:09,340
Come here. It's Saturday.

51
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:12,880
- Unless you wanna have a drink with me tonight.
- Maybe.

52
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,980
We just couldn't wait
until Monday to find out.

53
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:18,750
- Find out what?
- Who proved the theorem.

54
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:44,610
This is correct.
Who did this?

55
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,980
- Jack?
- It wasn't me.

56
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,750
- Nemesh?
- N-No way.

57
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,590
- Come on, Joey, now!
- Billy, McNamara's up.

58
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:59,090
Come on, kid!

59
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,360
- Joey, dig it out! Dig it out!
- Son of a bitch!

60
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:05,000
Bring it down, Mac! That's how to
do it! Attaboy! Take two, Mac.

61
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:12,540
Hey, Morgan, who's the girl with the
striped pants? She's got a nice ass.

62
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,610
Yeah, that's a real nice ass.
- Who's the guy she's with?

63
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:18,980
That fuckin' guinea. I hate that
little bitch. Will knows him.

64
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,680
Yeah, I do.
Yeah, fuckin' Carmine Scarpaglia.

65
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,680
- That guy used to beat the shit out of me in kindergarten.
- That guy?

66
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,980
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

67
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:29,620
Fuck this.
Let's get some food.

68
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:33,860
- Oh, what, Morgan, you're not gonna go talk to her?
- Fuck her.

69
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,330
- I could go for a Whopper.
- Let's go to Kelly's.

70
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:39,500
Morgan, I'm not goin' to Kelly's just
'cause you like the take-out girl.

71
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,870
- It's 15 minutes out of our way.
- What the fuck are we gonna do? We can't spare 15 minutes?

72
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,300
Double burger.

73
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,240
Double burger.

74
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:51,840
Double burger.

75
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:54,880
Chuck, I had
a double burger.

76
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:58,080
Would you shut the fuck up!
I know what you ordered. I was there.

77
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:01,180
- So give me my fuckin' sandwich.
- What do you mean, your sandwich? I bought it.

78
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,050
Morgan, how much money
you got on you?

79
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,890
I said I'd get change
when I get the snow cone.

80
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:09,420
I said that when we pulled up. Give me
my sandwich and stop bein' a prick.

81
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:12,590
All right, well, give me your fuckin'
16 cents that you got on you now.

82
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:17,060
We'll put your fuckin' sandwich on layaway.
Here we go. Keep it right up here for ya.

83
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:19,770
We'll put you on a program. Every day
you come in here with your six cents.

84
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:23,040
- At the end of the week, you get your sandwich.
- Are you gonna be an asshole?

85
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:27,340
What am I, fuckin' sandwich welfare? I think
you should establish a good line of credit.

86
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:30,180
Like how you bought
your couch- payment plans.

87
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,510
Remember how your mother brought in
ten dollars every day for a year.

88
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,520
She finally got her couch
Rent-A-Center style.

89
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:38,890
- Can I have my food, please?
- Here's your fuckin' double burger.

90
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,090
- Whoa!
- Hey, hold up, Chuck.

91
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,530
- Slow it down.
- Who do we got?

92
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:47,530
- I don't know yet.
- Hey, douche bag!

93
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:50,130
Yeah, you, you skank face!

94
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,700
- Shut the fuck up. - Get outta
here. - What are you worried about?

95
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:56,700
Why don't you lick
my love stick?

96
00:10:56,770 --> 00:11:01,810
We seen the guy 15 minutes ago. We should've
fight him then. We're eatin' our snacks now.

97
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,940
- Shut up, Morgan, you're goin'.
- I'm not goin'. - So don't go.

98
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:07,810
- I'm not goin'.
- Fuckin' go, Morgan.

99
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,350
Let me tell you somethin'. If you're not
out there in two fuckin' seconds,

100
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,280
when I'm done with them,
you're next.

101
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:16,450
Carmine, it's me, Will. Remember,
we went to kindergarten together.

102
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,960
# Way down the street
there's a light in his place #

103
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:24,060
- # He opens the door, he's
got that look on his face #

104
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:34,240
- Fuckin', let's go, man.
- Step on his fuckin' head.

105
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:38,280
Get his ass on the ground.
Stop that motherfucker.

106
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,580
Motherfucker, die!

107
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:49,990
- Carter!
- Come on!

108
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:04,940
Will! Will, come on!

109
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,500
Will, come on.
Let's go. Let's go.

110
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,770
Easy, brother, easy.

111
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:15,310
- Hey, fellas, thanks for comin' out.
- Come here!

112
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,810
Whoa! Whoa!

113
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,120
Ah. Fuck.

114
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:35,730
Is it just my imagination,
or has my class grown considerably?

115
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,870
Well, by no stretch
of my imagination...

116
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:41,540
do I believe you've all come here
to hear me lecture.

117
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,410
Rather, to ascertain the identity
of the mystery math magician.

118
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,450
So without further adieu, come forward,
silent rogue, and receive thy prize.

119
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:06,130
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint
my spectators, but...

120
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:08,960
it seems there will be
no unmasking here today.

121
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:13,200
However, uh, my colleagues and I
have conferred,

122
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:15,870
and there is a problem
on the board right now...

123
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:19,170
that took us
more than two years to prove.

124
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,940
So let this be said:
The gauntlet has been thrown down,

125
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:27,010
but the faculty have answered
and answered with vigor.

126
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:41,730
Hey, when's the arraignment?

127
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,730
Next week.

128
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:11,360
Sorry.

129
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:13,460
- What are you doing?
- Sorry.

130
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:17,460
That's people's work.
You can't graffiti here.

131
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:20,260
- Don't you walk away from me!
- Hey, fuck you!

132
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:23,400
Oh, you're a clever one.
What's your name?

133
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,760
Oh, my God.

134
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:56,370
Looks right.

135
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,180
Will, how retarded do you gotta be
to get fired from that job?

136
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,990
I mean, how hard is it
to push a motherfuckin' broom around?

137
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,090
Mitch, you got fired
from pushin' a fuckin' broom.

138
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,520
I got fired 'cause
management was restructuring.

139
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:25,330
Yeah, restructuring the amount
of retards they had workin' for 'em.

140
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,660
Shut up. You get canned
more than tuna, bitch.

141
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:31,070
At least I got a motherfuckin' job
right now, don't I?

142
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:36,770
- Why'd you get fired, Will? Come on.
- Management was restructuring.

143
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,370
- My uncle could probably get you on a demo team.
- Can he do that?

144
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,010
You kiddin' me! I asked you
yesterday if I could get a job.

145
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,050
And I told you "no"
yesterday.

146
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,710
- What's up, Casey? - What's
up, Case? - What's up, Big Case?

147
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,720
Let's sit over here.

148
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,720
All right. Let's go.

149
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:02,900
Oh, this is- this is
a Harvard bar, huh?

150
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,300
I thought there'd be, like,
equations and shit on the wall.

151
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:11,000
I will take a pitcher
of the finest lager in the house.

152
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:22,150
Timeout. I'm gonna have to bust a little move
on them Harvard hotties down there at the bar.

153
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:26,150
- Work some magic.
- Get some potion for us.

154
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:44,240
- Oh, hello.
- Oh, hello.

155
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,440
- Hi. How are ya?
- Fine.

156
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:48,470
- So, do you ladies, uh-
- Come here often?

157
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,440
Do I come here?
I come here a bit.

158
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,610
I'm here, you know,
from time to time.

159
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,080
- Do you go to school here?
- Yep.

160
00:16:56,150 --> 00:17:01,420
- Yeah, that's it. I think I had a class with you.
- Oh, yeah. What class?

161
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:03,420
- History.
- Maybe.

162
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,490
Yes, I think
that's what it was.

163
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:09,160
You don't necessarily- may not
remember me. You know, I like it here.

164
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:13,330
- It doesn't mean 'cause I go here, I'm a genius. I am very smart.
- Hey.

165
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,230
- Hey, how's it goin'? How are ya?
- Good. How ya doin'?

166
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,900
What class
did you say that was?

167
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,900
- History.
- Yeah.

168
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:23,510
Just history? It must have been
a survey course then.

169
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:25,510
- Yeah, it was. It was surveys.
- Right.

170
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,940
You should check it out. It's a good
course. It'd be a good class.

171
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:32,580
- How'd you like that course?
- You know, frankly,

172
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:35,350
- I found that class, you know, rather elementary.
- Elementary.

173
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,350
- You know, I don't doubt that it was.
- Yeah.

174
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:40,460
I, uh,
I remember that class.

175
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:44,030
It was, um-
It was just between recess and lunch.

176
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:46,630
Clark, why don't you
go away?

177
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,270
- Why don't you relax?
- Why don't you go away?

178
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:51,870
- I'm just havin' fun with my new friend.
- Are we gonna have a problem?

179
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:54,600
No, no, no, no.
There's no problem here.

180
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:58,140
I was just hoping you might give me
some insight into the evolution...

181
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:01,380
of the market economy
in the southern colonies.

182
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,920
My contention is that prior to the
Revolutionary War, the economic modalities...

183
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,750
especially
in the southern colonies...

184
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:12,450
could most aptly
be characterized as...

185
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,460
- agrarian precapitalist.
- Let me tell you somethin'.

186
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,860
Of course that's your contention.
You're a first-year grad student.

187
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:21,030
You just got finished readin' some Marxian historian
- Pete Garrison, probably...

188
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,260
You're gonna be convinced of that till
next month when you get to James Lemon.

189
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:26,400
Then you're gonna be talkin' about how the
economies of Virginia and Pennsylvania...

190
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:29,600
were entrepreneurial
and capitalist way back in 1740.

191
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:33,070
That's gonna last until next year. You're
gonna be in here regurgitatin' Gordon Wood,

192
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:36,210
talkin' about, you know,
the prerevolutionary utopia...

193
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:39,280
and the capital-forming effects
of military mobilization.

194
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,680
Well,
as a matter of fact, I won't,

195
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:45,020
because Wood drastically
underestimates the impact of...

196
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:48,490
Wood drastically underestimates
the impact of social distinctions...

197
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,830
predicated upon wealth,
especially inherited wealth.

198
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:56,130
You got that from Vickers'
Work in Essex County. Page 98, right?

199
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,800
I read that too. Were you gonna
plagiarize the whole thing for us?

200
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:02,470
Do you have any thoughts
of your own on this matter?

201
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:05,670
Or is that your thing? You come into
a bar. You read some obscure passage.

202
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:08,610
Then pretend-
pawn it off as your own.

203
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:12,310
As your own idea just to impress
some girls? Embarrass my friend?

204
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:16,050
See, the sad thing about a guy like
you is, in 50 years,

205
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,050
you're gonna start doin'
some thinkin' on your own.

206
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,820
You're gonna come up with the fact that
there are two certainties in life.

207
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:22,620
One: Don't do that.

208
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:25,720
And two: You dropped 150 grand
on a fuckin' education...

209
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,790
you could've got for $1.50
in late charges at the public library.

210
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,600
Yeah, but
I will have a degree,

211
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:38,940
and you'll be servin' my kids fries at a
drive through on our way to a skiing trip.

212
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,010
Maybe, but at least
I won't be unoriginal.

213
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:46,740
If you have a problem with that, we could
step outside. We could figure it out.

214
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:51,020
No, man, there's no problem.
It's cool.

215
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,020
- It's cool?
- Yeah.

216
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,020
- Cool.
- Damn right, it's cool.

217
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:58,520
How do you like me now?

218
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:03,830
My boy's wicked smart.

219
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:07,800
I just spent three minutes in this
fuckin' place and run into a barney, huh?

220
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:11,700
There it is.

221
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,740
- Nice to meet you.
- They were fine, man.

222
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:18,680
I was gonna close the deal, but then
Chuck- Billy insulted one of 'em...

223
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:22,310
The heavyset girl said I had a receding
hairline, and I was a few pounds overweight.

224
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,310
And I was, like,
"Go fuck yourself."

225
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,320
I swallowed a bug.

226
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,490
Hi.

227
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:33,490
- You're an idiot.
- What?

228
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,620
You're an idiot. I've been sitting
over there for 45 minutes...

229
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:37,630
waiting for you
to come and talk to me.

230
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:40,300
But I'm tired now,
and I have to go home.

231
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,970
I couldn't sit there anymore
waiting for you.

232
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:44,970
- I'm Will.
- Skylar.

233
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,970
- Skylar.
- Oh, and by the way,

234
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:50,340
that guy over there-
Michael Bolton clone...

235
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:52,370
He wasn't sitting with us,
so to speak.

236
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,780
- I know. I kinda got that impression.
- Good. Okay.

237
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,810
Well, I've got to go.

238
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:02,150
Gotta get up early and waste some more
money on my overpriced education.

239
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,390
- No, I didn't mean you.
- That's all right.

240
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:08,090
There's my number. Maybe we can
go out for coffee sometime.

241
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,830
All right, yeah. Maybe we can just get
together and eat a bunch of caramels.

242
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:13,830
- What do you mean?
- When you think about it,

243
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:18,770
- it's as arbitrary as drinkin' coffee.
- Oh. Yeah. Okay.

244
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:21,870
Uh, right, then.

245
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:25,510
Oh, come on. You're kidding.

246
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:29,910
Yo!

247
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:31,880
- Fuck you, bitch!
- Fuck you.

248
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:35,650
- There goes them fuckin' barneys right now with his skiin' trip.
- Hold on.

249
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,150
We should've beat
that old bitch's ass.

250
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:47,360
Do you like apples?

251
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,600
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

252
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,800
Well, I got her number!
How do you like them apples?

253
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:05,510
# We arrived tonight #

254
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:11,180
# The miles were over me #

255
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:16,560
# I turned off the light #

256
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:21,590
# So, come on, night #

257
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,300
# Everyone who's gone #

258
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,910
# Home to oblivion #

259
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:41,680
# So come home #

260
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:46,350
# So come on by #

261
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,190
Come.

262
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:57,790
Excuse me? Is this
the Buildings and Grounds office?

263
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:00,230
Yeah. What can I do
for you?

264
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,370
I just need the name
of a student who works here.

265
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:04,870
- No students work for me.
- Could you please check?

266
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:07,100
I have this guy
who works in my building.

267
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:09,610
- He's about this high.
- Which one is your building?

268
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:12,610
- Two.
- Two. Building two.

269
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,750
- Look, if anything was stolen, I should know about it.
- No, it's nothing like that.

270
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:23,020
I just need his name.

271
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:26,990
- I can't give you his name unless you have a complaint.
- This is Professor Lambeau.

272
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:29,090
And this is
Professor Hayes.

273
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,090
Tom, please.

274
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:37,330
This is important.
Please.

275
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,630
Will didn't show
for work today.

276
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:43,340
Got this job through
his P.O. You can call him.

277
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:47,440
- P.O.?
- Yeah. Parole officer.

278
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,410
Thank you.

279
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,620
Asshole.

280
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:04,030
There is a lengthy legal precedent,
Your Honor, going back to 1789,

281
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:07,190
whereby a defendant can claim self-defense
against an agent of the government...

282
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:10,660
if that act is deemed a defense against
tyranny, a defense of liberty.

283
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:12,870
Your Honor, Henry Ward Beecher,

284
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:16,700
- in Proverbs from the Plymouth
Pulpit, 1887, said, quote- - 1887?

285
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:18,610
- Excuse me.
- This is the 20th century.

286
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:22,910
- He's gonna make a mockery.
- I am afforded the right to speak in my own defense, sir,

287
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,710
by the Constitution
of the United States.

288
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,610
- Don't tell me about the Constitution.
- This guarantees my liberty.

289
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,180
"Liberty," in case you've forgotten,
is a soul's right to breathe.

290
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:32,790
When it cannot take a long breath,
laws are girded too tight.

291
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:35,150
- Without liberty, man is a syncope.
- Man is a what?

292
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:38,390
- Ibid., Your Honor.
- Son, my turn.

293
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:43,160
I've been sitting here for ten minutes
now lookin' over this rap sheet of yours.

294
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:47,230
I just can't believe it.
June '93, assault.

295
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,400
September '93, assault.

296
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:53,070
Grand theft auto,
February of '94.

297
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:57,380
Where, apparently, you defended yourself
and had the case thrown out by citing...

298
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,650
"free property rights
of horse and carriage" from 1798.

299
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:05,320
Joke. January '95,
impersonating an officer.

300
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:09,350
Mayhem, theft, resisting.
All overturned.

301
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:13,360
I'm also aware that you've been
through several foster homes.

302
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:17,360
The state removed you from three
because of serious physical abuse.

303
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:21,870
You know, another judge might care,
but you hit a cop. You're going in.

304
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:25,400
Motion to dismiss is denied.
$50,000 bail.

305
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:27,070
Thank you.

306
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,710
Rise.

307
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,410
- Hello?
- Uh, Skylar?

308
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,610
- Yep.
- Hey, uh, it's Will.

309
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,380
- Who?
- It's Will.

310
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:40,550
You know, the really funny, good-looking
guy you met at the bar the other night.

311
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:44,250
I don't recall meeting anyone who matches
that description. I think I'd remember.

312
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,790
Oh, all right, you got me. It's the
ugly, obnoxious, toothless loser...

313
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,790
who got hammered and wouldn't
leave you alone all night.

314
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:54,000
Oh, Will! I remember.

315
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:57,370
How are you?
I was wondering if you'd call me.

316
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,370
- Yeah, look, I was wondering-
- Yo, what's up, baby?

317
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,570
- Hold on one second.
- What you doing? Want some of my ass?

318
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:07,240
- Herve, I remember you from juvi. How you doing?
- What you doing?

319
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:09,650
Oh, yeah,
sorry about that.

320
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:12,480
I was wonderin' maybe we could
get together sometime this week.

321
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:16,490
- Sit out at a cafe. Maybe have some caramels.
- Oh, that sounds wonderful.

322
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:19,350
- Yeah?
- Yeah, sure. Where are you?

323
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:22,420
Uh, well, actually,
this is just a shot in the dark,

324
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:26,730
but, uh, there's no chance
that you're pre-law, is there?

325
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:32,870
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

326
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,870
Nice talking to ya.

327
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,570
What the fuck
do you want?

328
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,480
I'm Gerald Lambeau.

329
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:46,480
Professor you told
to fuck himself.

330
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:50,720
Well, what the fuck
do you want?

331
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:54,860
I've spoken to the judge, and he's agreed
to release you under my supervision.

332
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,360
- Really?
- Yeah.

333
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:05,300
- Under two conditions.
- What are those?

334
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:08,000
First condition is that
you meet with me every week.

335
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:11,400
- What for?
- Go over the proof you're working on,

336
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:16,240
get into
some more advanced...

337
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:19,310
combinatorial mathematics,

338
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,310
finite math.

339
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,420
Sounds like a real hoot.

340
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:30,090
And the second condition
is that...

341
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,460
that you see a therapist.

342
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:39,630
I'm responsible to submit reports
on those meetings.

343
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:44,740
If you fail to meet with any of those
conditions, you will have to serve time.

344
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:49,240
All right. I'll do the math, but I'm not
gonna meet with any fuckin' therapist.

345
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:53,240
It's better than spending
that time in jail, isn't it?

346
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:01,080
I read your book, and "Mike"
was havin' the same problems...

347
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:03,380
that "Chad," the stockbroker,
was havin'.

348
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,480
Absolutely right. Right on the button.
Good for you, Will.

349
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,520
- Very nice.
- Thank you.

350
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,550
Will, the pressures-
and I'm not judging them.

351
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:14,390
I'm not labeling them,

352
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:17,430
but they are destroying
your potential.

353
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:22,530
No more shenanigans.
No more tomfoolery. No more ballyhoo.

354
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:27,500
You're right.
God, I know.

355
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:31,370
You're not gonna get off that easily.
Come on, Will. A bit more.

356
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:36,480
- Well, I mean, I do do things, you
know? - What- What kind of things?

357
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:39,150
I do things that, you know,
I mean, I hide from people.

358
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:44,650
- You hide, do you? - No, no. I
mean, I like- I go places. I interact.

359
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,750
- Really? What sort of places?
- Just certain clubs.

360
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:48,920
More. That's nice. Yes.
What sort of clubs?

361
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,420
Like, uh, like Fantasy.

362
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:54,990
Fantasy. That's nice.
A bit more.

363
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:58,700
It's something like when you get
in there, the music, like, owns you.

364
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,270
It's like that house music. It's like-
# Bom, bom, bom #

365
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:04,100
# Bom-bom-bom
Boom, boom, boom, boom #

366
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,710
- You know, you start dancin'.
- Boom, boom, boom. Yeah.

367
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:09,110
It's just...

368
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:10,840
Yes.

369
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:17,050
Do you find it hard to hide
the fact that you're gay?

370
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:19,990
What are you talking about? What?

371
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:22,790
Look, buddy, two seconds ago,
you were ready to give me a jump.

372
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:26,390
A jump? Are you...

373
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:28,460
I'm terribly sorry
to disappoint you.

374
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:31,260
Hey, I don't have a problem with it.
I don't care if you putt from the rough.

375
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:35,270
What are you- P- Putting from the rough?
What on earth are you talking about?

376
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:40,540
A difficult theorem
could be like a symphony.

377
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,170
It's very erotic.

378
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:45,640
You go somewhere else.
I can't handle this.

379
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:49,050
- Wow.
- Thank you, Henry.

380
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:51,820
- Ah, Henry.
- Hi, Gerry.

381
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,350
You know something?
I can't do this pro bono work anymore.

382
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,920
- It's just not- It's not worth it.
- What happened?

383
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,960
Well, I'm going on national
television next week.

384
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:02,490
I mean, I haven't got time to tell you, much
less talk to that raving looney in there.

385
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:05,530
An absolute lunatic,
he is.

386
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,130
Henry.

387
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:10,870
Okay,
you are in your bed, Will.

388
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:14,570
Now, how old are you?

389
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,670
Seven.

390
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,680
What do you see?

391
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,150
Something's in my room.

392
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:26,820
What is it?

393
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:31,890
It's like a- It's a figure.
It's hoverin' over me.

394
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:35,520
You are in a safe place,
Will.

395
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:39,130
It's t-
It's touchin' me.

396
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:42,130
Where is it touching you?

397
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,670
It's touching me
down there,

398
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,300
and I'm nervous.

399
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:52,140
You don't have to be
nervous, Will.

400
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,080
We start dancin' and dancin'.

401
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:58,080
It's just beautiful,

402
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:00,080
'cause we can make...

403
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:05,590
a lot of love
before the sun goes down.

404
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:09,660
# Skyrockets
in flight #

405
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,490
# Afternoon delight #

406
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:16,030
- # Hey, hey, hey, afternoon delight #
- Jesus.

407
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:20,100
# Skyrockets in flight
Da-da-da-da #

408
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,670
- I'm sorry, Rich.
- I have better things to do with my time.

409
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:27,270
# Hey, hey, afternoon delight #
Come on! One dance!

410
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:30,210
You really hypnotized me,
you know?

411
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:34,110
- For God's sake, Will.
- What? Oh, come on. He left. You can't pin that on me.

412
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:37,420
- I told you to cooperate with these people.
- Look...

413
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,890
- into my eyes.
- Get out, Will.

414
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:42,520
I don't need therapy.

415
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:46,390
That's enough. Get out!

416
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:50,630
- I called Mel Weintraub this
morning to see- - Oh, what's the use?

417
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:52,670
What do you want to do?

418
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:59,270
- Well, there's someone.
- Who is he?

419
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:04,810
He used to be my, uh-
my roommate in college.

420
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:12,280
Trust. Very important
in a relationship.

421
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:14,320
It's also very important
in a clinical situation.

422
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:17,260
Why is trust
the most important thing...

423
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:21,730
in making a breakthrough
with a client?

424
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:26,300
Maureen, stop the oral fixation
for a moment and join us.

425
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,970
- Vinnie.
- Um...

426
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:33,040
Because, uh...

427
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:36,070
Trust is, uh-
Trust is life.

428
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:39,810
Wow. That's very deep.
Thank you, Vinnie.

429
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:42,610
Next time,
get the notes from your brother.

430
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:46,080
If a patient doesn't feel safe enough trust
you, then they won't be honest with you.

431
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:48,290
Then there's really no point
for them being in therapy.

432
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:52,460
I mean, hey, if they don't trust you, you're
never gonna get them to sleep with you.

433
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:55,530
That should be the goal of any good
therapist. Nail 'em while they're vulnerable.

434
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:57,290
That's my motto.

435
00:33:57,390 --> 00:33:59,900
Oh, good, everyone's back.
Welcome back, everybody.

436
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:05,070
- Hello, Sean.
- Hey, Gerry.

437
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:12,310
Um, ladies and gentlemen,
we are in the presence of greatness.

438
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:16,380
Professor Gerald Lambeau, Field's medal
winner for combinatorial mathematics.

439
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,250
- Hello.
- Anyone know what the Field's medal is?

440
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:22,120
It's a really big deal.
It's like the Nobel prize for math.

441
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:27,220
Except they only give it out once
every four years. It's a great thing.

442
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,390
It's an amazing honor.
Okay, everybody, that's it for today.

443
00:34:30,490 --> 00:34:33,930
Thanks. We'll see you Monday.
We'll be talking about Freud.

444
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,300
Why he did enough cocaine
to kill a small horse. Thank you.

445
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:41,840
- How are you?
- It's good to see you.

446
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,870
Good to see you.

447
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:47,510
- Sean, I think I got something interesting for ya.
- Yeah?

448
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:50,080
What, you have to have
blood and urine? What's up?

449
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:52,480
Why didn't you come
to the reunion?

450
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:56,020
You know, I'm-
I've been busy.

451
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,050
- You were missed.
- Really?

452
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:02,420
- So how long has it been since we've seen each other?
- Before Nancy died.

453
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,460
Yeah, I'm sorry.

454
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:07,190
I was in Paris.
It was that damn conference.

455
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:08,930
I got your card.
It was nice.

456
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:16,340
- Come here.
- Now that's a takedown.

457
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,270
Hey, what happened?
Did you get leniency or what?

458
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:25,040
I got, uh, probation
and then counseling two days a week.

459
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:28,810
Joke. You're a smoothie.
Come on, Morgan! Just submit!

460
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:33,120
Hey, Bill, just-just get off him.
We're gonna miss the game.

461
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:35,190
- I've got a full schedule. I'm very busy.
- Sean, Sean.

462
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:38,260
This-This boy is incredible.
I've never seen anything like him.

463
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:41,730
What makes him
so incredible, Gerry?

464
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:45,860
- You ever heard of Ramanujan?
- Yeah, yeah. No.

465
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:50,670
It's a man. He lived
over 100 years ago. He was Indian.

466
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:53,640
- Dots, not feathers.
- Not feathers. Yeah.

467
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:55,640
He lived in this tiny hut
somewhere in India.

468
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:58,140
He had no formal education.

469
00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:00,710
- He had no access to any scientific work.
- Coffee?

470
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:03,010
- You, sir?
- Just a little.

471
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:05,520
But he came across
this old math book,

472
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:08,190
and from the simple text,
he was able to extrapolate theories...

473
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:10,220
that had baffled
mathematicians for years.

474
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:13,360
Yes. Continued fractions.
He wrote, uh...

475
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:17,530
- Well, he mailed it to Hardy at Cambridge.
- Yeah, Cambridge. Yeah.

476
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:20,900
- And Hardy immediately recognized
the brilliance of his work... - Mm-hmm.

477
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,570
and brought him over to England,
and then they worked together for years,

478
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:27,140
creating some of the most
exciting math theory ever done.

479
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,540
This-This Ramanujan...

480
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:33,610
his-his genius
was unparalleled, Sean.

481
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:37,110
- Well, this boy's just like that.
- Hmm.

482
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:40,750
- But he's- he's a bit defensive.
- Hmm.

483
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:42,820
I need someone
who can get through to him.

484
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:46,390
- Like me?
- Yeah, like you.

485
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:49,560
- Why?
- Well, because you have the same kind of background.

486
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:52,930
- What background?
- Well, you're from the same neighborhood.

487
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:56,300
- He's from Southie?
- Yeah.

488
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,200
Boy genius from Southie.

489
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:03,440
- How many shrinks you go to before me?
- Five.

490
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:07,940
- Let me guess. Barry? Henry? Not Rick?
- Yeah. Yeah.

491
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:11,080
- Sean, please, just meet
with him once a week. - Mm-hmm.

492
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:13,120
Please?

493
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:19,390
It's a poker game with this kid.
Don't let him know what you've got.

494
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:22,560
He probably even read your book,
if he could find it.

495
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,990
It's gonna be hard
for him to find.

496
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:26,500
- Hi, Will.
- Hi.

497
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,500
This is Sean Maguire.
Will Hunting.

498
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,500
How are ya?

499
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:36,900
- Yeah. Let's get started.
- Yeah, let's do it.

500
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:39,070
I'm pumped.
Let's let the healing begin.

501
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:42,640
- Will you excuse us?
- Yeah, please, Tom.

502
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:45,310
You, too, Gerry.

503
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:47,310
Yeah, of course.

504
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,660
How are you?

505
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:59,030
Where you from
in Southie?

506
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:02,000
- I like what you've done with the place.
- Oh, thanks.

507
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:04,330
Do you buy all these books
retail,

508
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,500
or do you send away for, like, a "shrink kit"
that comes with all these volumes included?

509
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:12,140
- Do you like books?
- Yeah.

510
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:14,340
- Did you read any of these books?
- I don't know.

511
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:17,180
- How about any of these books?
- Probably not.

512
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:20,950
What about the ones
on the top shelf? You read those?

513
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:24,950
- Yeah, I read those.
- Good for you. What do you think about 'em?

514
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:27,890
I'm not here for a fuckin' book report.
They're your books. Why don't you read 'em?

515
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:29,790
I did. I had to.

516
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:33,290
- Must've taken you a long time.
- Yeah, it did.

517
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:44,900
United States of America:
A Complete History, Volume I.

518
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,850
Jesus. If you wanna read
a real history book,

519
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,890
read Howard Zinn's
A People's History in the United States.

520
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:02,890
That book'll fuckin'
knock you on your ass.

521
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:04,990
Better than Chomsky's
Manufacturing Consent?

522
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:09,830
- Do you think that's a good book?
- You fuckin' people baffle me.

523
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:14,570
You spend all your money on these fuckin'
fancy books. You surround yourselves with 'em.

524
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:17,030
- They're the wrong fuckin' books.
- What are the right fuckin' books, Will?

525
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:21,440
- Whatever blows your hair back.
- Yeah. Haven't got much hair left.

526
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:24,110
Hey, you know you'd be better
shoving that cigarette up your ass.

527
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:26,310
- It'd probably be healthier for you.
- Yeah, I know.

528
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:29,850
- It really gets in the way of my yoga.
- You work out, huh?

529
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:32,820
- What, you lift?
- Yeah.

530
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,420
- Nautilus?
- No, free weights.

531
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,890
- Oh, really? Free weights, huh?
- Yeah. Yeah, big time.

532
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:38,220
- Yeah?
- Just like that.

533
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:43,030
- What do you bench?
- 285. What do you bench?

534
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:45,290
You paint that?

535
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,300
- Yeah. Do you paint?
- Uh-uh.

536
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:50,870
- Do you sculpt?
- No.

537
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:53,270
Do you like art?

538
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:57,640
- Do you like music?
- This is a real piece of shit.

539
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:59,640
Oh, tell me what
you really think.

540
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:05,380
Just the linear and impressionistic mix
makes a very muddled composition.

541
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:09,650
It's also a Winslow Homer rip-off, except
you got whitey rowin' the boat there.

542
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,650
Well, it's art, Monet.
It wasn't very good.

543
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:14,220
- That's not really what concerns me though.
- What concerns you?

544
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:16,690
- Just the coloring.
- You know what the real bitch of it is?

545
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,890
It's paint-by-number.

546
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,400
Is it color-by-number? Because
the colors are fascinating to me.

547
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,960
- Aren't they really?
- You bet.

548
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:26,730
I think you're about one step away
from cuttin' your fuckin' ear off.

549
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,370
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

550
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:32,110
Think I should move to the south of
France, change my name to "Vincent"?

551
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:35,510
- You ever heard the sayin', "any port in a storm"?
- Yeah.

552
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:38,550
- Yeah, maybe that means you.
- In what way?

553
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:42,080
- Maybe you're in the middle of a storm, a big fuckin' storm.
- Yeah, maybe.

554
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:45,320
The sky's fallin' on your head. The
waves are crashin' over your little boat.

555
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:47,490
The oars are about to snap.

556
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:49,520
You just piss in your pants.
You're cryin' for the harbor.

557
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:51,860
So maybe you do
what you gotta do to get out.

558
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:54,260
You know, maybe you became
a psychologist.

559
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:57,860
Bingo. That's it. Let me do my job now.
You start with me. Come on.

560
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:05,670
- Maybe you married the wrong woman.
- Maybe you should watch your mouth!

561
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:08,670
Watch it right there, chief,
all right?

562
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:12,450
Ah.

563
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,850
That's it, isn't it?

564
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:22,420
You married
the wrong woman.

565
00:41:22,490 --> 00:41:27,160
What happened?
What, did she leave you?

566
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:30,230
Was she, you know-
banging some other guy?

567
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:35,030
If you ever disrespect my wife again,
I will end you.

568
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:37,200
I will fuckin' end you.

569
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:40,740
Got that, chief?

570
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:42,740
Time's up.

571
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:45,140
Yeah.

572
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:00,360
At ease, gentlemen.

573
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:08,400
You okay?

574
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:17,810
Look, I'll understand if you don't
wanna meet with him again.

575
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:21,610
Thursday, 4:00.
Make sure the kid's here.

576
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:25,820
Yeah.

577
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,820
Thanks.

578
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:35,150
Well, you look lovely
in those glasses.

579
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:37,150
- Thank you very much.
- They're just beautiful.

580
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:41,150
- Yes, I always wanted dark blue eye shadow.
- Wonderful.

581
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:47,190
Growing up in England, you know,
I went to a very nice school.

582
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:52,560
You know, it was kind of progressive,
organic, do-it-yourself, private school.

583
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:57,100
Then Harvard.
Hopefully med school.

584
00:43:57,170 --> 00:43:59,100
You know, I figured out,
by the end,

585
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:03,480
my brain's gonna be worth
$250,000.

586
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:07,080
That sounded horrible,
didn't it?

587
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:09,820
Bring me another mai tai!

588
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:14,090
Yeah, that's cool. I mean,
I bet your parents were happy to pay.

589
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:18,060
No, I was happy to pay.
I inherited the money.

590
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:21,560
Wow. Is Harvard gettin'
all that money?

591
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:24,660
No, Stanford. I'm going there
in June when I graduate.

592
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:29,770
All right, so you just wanted to use
this sailor and then run away, huh?

593
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:33,070
I was gonna, you know, experiment on you
for anatomy class first, obviously.

594
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:35,440
In that case, that's fine.

595
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:38,280
- Hey, you wanna see my magic tricks, Skylar?
- Of course.

596
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:41,550
All right.
Promise to...

597
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:43,910
All right.

598
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:47,690
- This one's for you, Rudolph.
- Wait, wait. You need my wand.

599
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:50,590
All right, give me a hit.
Thank you. All right.

600
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:52,590
I'm gonna make
all these caramels disappear.

601
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:55,460
You ready?
Ready.

602
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:58,130
One, two, three.

603
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:01,200
They're all gone.

604
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:03,830
That was my- It works better
when I have my rabbit.

605
00:45:03,970 --> 00:45:06,870
Well...

606
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:09,570
I don't really date,
you know, that much.

607
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:14,580
How very unfortunate...
I think for me.

608
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,950
You know what I mean?
I know you've been thinking about it.

609
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:19,950
- Oh, no, I haven't.
- Yes, you have.

610
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:22,720
- No, I really haven't.
- Yes, you have. You were hoping to get a good night kiss.

611
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:25,890
No, you know, I tell ya,
I was hopin' to get a good night laid.

612
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:30,860
But I'll settle for,
like, a kiss, you know?

613
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,760
- How very noble of you.
- Thank you.

614
00:45:33,830 --> 00:45:37,300
- Mm.
- No, I was- I was hopin' for a kiss.

615
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:42,870
Well, why don't we just
get it out of the way now?

616
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:45,370
- Right now?
- Yeah.

617
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,380
Come on.

618
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:58,650
I think I got
some of your pickle.

619
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,670
You again, huh?

620
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:15,840
Come with me.

621
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:27,150
So what's this?
A Taster's Choice moment between guys?

622
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:31,780
This is really nice. You got a thing
for swans? Is this, like, a fetish?

623
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:34,220
Is it something, like, maybe
we need to devote some time to?

624
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:41,460
- Thought about what you said to me the other day. About my painting.
- Oh.

625
00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:44,460
Stayed up half the night
thinking about it.

626
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:47,830
Something occurred to me.

627
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:52,440
I fell into a deep, peaceful sleep
and haven't thought about you since.

628
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:55,510
- You know what occurred to me?
- No.

629
00:46:55,610 --> 00:47:00,080
You're just a kid. You don't have the
faintest idea what you're talking about.

630
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:03,280
- Why, thank you.
- It's all right.

631
00:47:03,350 --> 00:47:05,780
You've never been
out of Boston.

632
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:09,890
Nope.

633
00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:12,120
So if I asked you about art,
you'd probably give me the skinny...

634
00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:14,790
on every art book
ever written.

635
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:18,630
Michelangelo?
You know a lot about him.

636
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:22,370
Life's work, political aspirations.
Him and the pope.

637
00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:27,240
Sexual orientation.
The whole works, right?

638
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:31,740
I bet you can't tell me what it
smells like in the Sistine Chapel.

639
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:37,910
You never actually stood there
and looked up at that beautiful ceiling.

640
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:43,090
Seeing that.

641
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:45,120
If I ask you about women,

642
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:48,860
you'll probably give me a syllabus
of your personal favorites.

643
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:51,860
You may have even been laid
a few times.

644
00:47:56,930 --> 00:48:00,200
But you can't tell me what it feels like
to wake up next to a woman...

645
00:48:00,270 --> 00:48:02,710
and feel truly happy.

646
00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:07,740
You're a tough kid.

647
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:13,420
I ask you about war, you'd probably
throw Shakespeare at me, right?

648
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:16,920
"Once more into the breach,
dear friends."

649
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:21,260
But you've never been near one.

650
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:24,090
You've never held your best friend's
head in your lap...

651
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:28,600
and watch him gasp his last
breath lookin' to you for help.

652
00:48:30,530 --> 00:48:35,700
If I asked you about love,
you'd probably quote me a sonnet,

653
00:48:35,770 --> 00:48:39,940
but you've never looked at a woman
and been totally vulnerable.

654
00:48:40,010 --> 00:48:44,310
Known someone that could
level you with her eyes.

655
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:48,820
Feelin' like God put
an angel on Earth just for you,

656
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:51,890
who could rescue you
from the depths of hell.

657
00:48:51,950 --> 00:48:55,160
And you wouldn't know
what it's like to be her angel,

658
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:58,260
to have that love for her
be there forever.

659
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:02,830
Through anything.
Through cancer.

660
00:49:02,930 --> 00:49:05,200
And you wouldn't know about sleepin'
sittin' up in a hospital room...

661
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:07,370
for two months,
holding her hand,

662
00:49:07,430 --> 00:49:09,370
because the doctors
could see in your eyes...

663
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:14,010
that the terms "visiting hours"
don't apply to you.

664
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:16,280
You don't know about real loss,

665
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:21,350
'cause that only occurs when you love
something more than you love yourself.

666
00:49:21,450 --> 00:49:25,380
I doubt you've ever dared
to love anybody that much.

667
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:32,690
I look at you. I don't see
an intelligent, confident man.

668
00:49:35,030 --> 00:49:38,460
I see a cocky,
scared shitless kid.

669
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:43,570
But you're a genius, Will.
No one denies that.

670
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:47,170
No one could possibly understand
the depths of you.

671
00:49:47,270 --> 00:49:50,310
But you presume to know everything about
me because you saw a painting of mine.

672
00:49:50,410 --> 00:49:53,340
You ripped
my fuckin' life apart.

673
00:49:56,850 --> 00:49:59,280
You're an orphan, right?

674
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:07,120
Do you think I'd know the first thing
about how hard your life has been...

675
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:09,790
how you feel, who you are...

676
00:50:09,890 --> 00:50:13,300
because I read Oliver Twist?

677
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:15,630
Does that encapsulate you?

678
00:50:17,970 --> 00:50:20,940
Personally, I don't give a shit
about all that, because...

679
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,170
You know what? I can't
learn anything from you...

680
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:25,680
I can't read
in some fuckin' book.

681
00:50:27,510 --> 00:50:29,580
Unless you wanna talk
about you,

682
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,610
who you are.

683
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:36,990
And I'm fascinated.
I'm in.

684
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:42,060
But you don't wanna do that,
do you, sport?

685
00:50:44,390 --> 00:50:47,330
You're terrified
of what you might say.

686
00:50:52,370 --> 00:50:54,300
Your move, chief.

687
00:52:01,870 --> 00:52:04,240
Hello? Hello?

688
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:07,170
Hello?

689
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:10,140
Professor Valenti,
are you calling me again?

690
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:14,980
Freak.

691
00:52:18,850 --> 00:52:21,450
- Oh, God.
- Christ, who did you call?

692
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:24,020
- No one. I forgot the number.
- You fuckin' retarded?

693
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:26,620
You went all the way out there in the
rain, and you didn't bring the number.

694
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:30,660
No, it was your mother's 900 number.
I just ran out of quarters.

695
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:33,260
Why don't we get off on mothers?
I just got off yours.

696
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:35,470
- That's
pretty funny, Morgan.

697
00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:38,040
That's a fuckin' nickel,
bitch.

698
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:40,440
- Keep antagonizing me. Watch what happens.
- All right, then, Morgan.

699
00:52:40,510 --> 00:52:42,340
- Watch what happens.
- All right, then, Morgan.

700
00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:44,580
Keep fuckin' with me.

701
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:52,450
No smoking.

702
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:27,020
What do you mean, he didn't talk?
You were in there for an hour.

703
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:30,390
He just sat there counting the seconds
until the session was over.

704
00:53:30,450 --> 00:53:33,160
- Pretty impressive, actually.
- Why would he do that?

705
00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:37,230
To prove to me he doesn't have
to talk to me if he doesn't want to.

706
00:53:37,330 --> 00:53:41,260
What is this? Some kind of staring contest
between two kids from the old neighborhood?

707
00:53:41,330 --> 00:53:45,130
Yeah, it is,
and I can't talk first.

708
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:50,140
We know your theory, Alexander, but the
boy's found a simple geometrical picture.

709
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:53,240
- A tree structure won't work.
- Look now. He's joining the two vertices.

710
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:55,810
But I can do the sum.

711
00:53:55,910 --> 00:53:58,380
- It's how you group the terms, Alexander.
- But, Gerry.

712
00:53:58,450 --> 00:54:00,380
If we do the whole thing
this way, then...

713
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:03,220
Hey, look, look.

714
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:06,720
I wrote it down.
It's simpler this way.

715
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:20,200
Sometimes
people get lucky.

716
00:54:20,270 --> 00:54:22,240
You're a brilliant man.

717
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:02,070
You know,
I was on this plane once,

718
00:55:02,170 --> 00:55:05,040
and I'm sittin' there, and...

719
00:55:05,110 --> 00:55:07,050
the captain gets on,
he does his whole, you know,

720
00:55:07,110 --> 00:55:09,680
"we'll be cruisin' at 35,000 feet,"
but then he puts the mike down.

721
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:12,420
- He forgets to turn it off.
- Mm-hmm.

722
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:14,450
So he turns to the copilot.
He's, like,

723
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:19,260
"You know, all I could use right now is
a fuckin' blow job and a cup of coffee."

724
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:21,860
So the stewardess fuckin' goes bombin'
up from the back of the plane...

725
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:23,590
to tell him
the microphone's still on.

726
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:27,030
This guy in the back of the plane's
like, "Hey, hon, don't forget the coffee."

727
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:30,570
You ever been on a plane?

728
00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:33,640
No, but it's a fuckin' joke. It works
better if I tell it in the first person.

729
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:35,670
Yeah, it does.

730
00:55:38,810 --> 00:55:40,740
I have been laid,
you know?

731
00:55:40,810 --> 00:55:43,080
Really? Good for you.

732
00:55:43,150 --> 00:55:45,080
- Big time, big time.
- Big time, huh?

733
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:48,250
I went on a date last week.

734
00:55:48,350 --> 00:55:51,350
- How'd it go?
- It was good.

735
00:55:51,450 --> 00:55:53,390
- Goin' out again?
- I don't know.

736
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:55,090
- Why?
- Haven't called her.

737
00:55:55,190 --> 00:55:58,530
- Christ, you're an amateur.
- I know what I'm doin'.

738
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:02,870
Yeah. Don't worry about me.
I know what I'm doin'.

739
00:56:02,930 --> 00:56:05,400
Yeah, but this girl was, like,
you know, beautiful.

740
00:56:05,470 --> 00:56:09,870
She's smart. She's fun. She's different
from most of the girls I've been with.

741
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:13,780
- So call her up, Romeo.
- Why, so I can realize she's not that smart.

742
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:16,180
That she's fuckin' boring?
You know, I mean, you don't...

743
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:19,680
This girl's, like, fuckin' perfect
right now. I don't wanna ruin that.

744
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:23,720
Maybe you're perfect right now.
Maybe you don't wanna ruin that.

745
00:56:25,390 --> 00:56:27,720
But I think that's
a super philosophy, Will.

746
00:56:27,790 --> 00:56:33,660
That way, you can go through your entire life
without ever having to really know anybody.

747
00:56:35,930 --> 00:56:37,900
My wife used to fart
when she was nervous.

748
00:56:37,970 --> 00:56:40,970
She had all sorts
of wonderful idiosyncrasies.

749
00:56:41,070 --> 00:56:43,640
You know, she used to fart
in her sleep.

750
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:46,610
Just thought I'd share that
with you.

751
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:49,210
One night it was so loud,
it woke the dog up.

752
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:55,020
She woke up and gone, like,
"Was that you?"

753
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:58,250
I said, "Yeah." I didn't have
the heart to tell her. Oh, God.

754
00:56:58,350 --> 00:57:00,590
- She woke herself up?
- Yes.

755
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:10,930
Oh, Christ. But, Will, she's been dead
two years and that's the shit I remember.

756
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,130
It's wonderful stuff, you know?
Little things like that.

757
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:18,170
Yeah, but those are the things
I miss the most.

758
00:57:18,270 --> 00:57:21,210
Those little idiosyncrasies
that only I knew about.

759
00:57:21,270 --> 00:57:23,840
That's what made her
my wife.

760
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:27,310
Boy, and she had the goods on me too.
She knew all my little peccadillos.

761
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:31,820
People call these things
"imperfections," but they're not.

762
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:34,620
That's the good stuff.

763
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:39,360
And then we get to choose who
we let into our weird little worlds.

764
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:41,390
You're not perfect, sport.

765
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:44,130
And let me save you
the suspense.

766
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:47,500
This girl you met,
she isn't perfect either.

767
00:57:47,570 --> 00:57:51,400
But the question is whether or not
you're perfect for each other.

768
00:57:51,470 --> 00:57:55,810
That's the whole deal.
That's what intimacy is all about.

769
00:57:55,870 --> 00:57:57,810
Now you can know
everything in the world, sport,

770
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:00,950
but the only way you're findin' out
that one is by givin' it a shot.

771
00:58:01,050 --> 00:58:03,720
You certainly won't learn
from an old fucker like me.

772
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:07,490
Even if I did know,
I wouldn't tell a pissant like you.

773
00:58:07,590 --> 00:58:09,550
Yeah, why not?

774
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:13,320
You told me every other
fuckin' thing. Jesus Christ.

775
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:16,190
Fuckin' talk more than any shrink
I ever seen in my life.

776
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:20,300
I teach the shit.
I didn't say I knew how to do it.

777
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,330
Yeah.

778
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:28,070
You ever think
about gettin' remarried?

779
00:58:28,170 --> 00:58:30,710
My wife's dead.

780
00:58:30,810 --> 00:58:33,910
- Hence the word "remarried."
- She's dead.

781
00:58:36,550 --> 00:58:39,820
Yeah, well, I think
that's a super philosophy, Sean.

782
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:42,050
I mean, that way, you can actually
go through the rest of your life...

783
00:58:42,150 --> 00:58:44,750
without ever really knowing
anybody.

784
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:49,390
Time's up.

785
00:59:03,870 --> 00:59:06,080
- Hold it open.
- Okay.

786
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:09,440
Thanks.

787
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:23,490
# I am happy with you #

788
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:27,560
# I know I'm about
to love you #

789
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:32,870
# Yeah, yeah, yeah
You know him #

790
00:59:32,930 --> 00:59:36,340
# Oh, my, you made me- #

791
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:39,670
"G" minor seventh.
Saddest of all chords.

792
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:42,940
- Hello.
- Hey.

793
00:59:43,010 --> 00:59:47,310
- Where have you been? - I'm sorry. I've
been, like- I've been really busy, and...

794
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:49,980
- But, um-
- Mmm. Me too.

795
00:59:50,050 --> 00:59:55,260
Yeah. I-
I thought you'd call.

796
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:57,460
Yeah, um...

797
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:00,890
- I mean, we had a really good time.
- I had a really good time too.

798
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:03,130
I mean, I just- I...

799
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,330
I'm sorry, you know.
I blew it.

800
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:07,570
No. No, I mean,
you know, it's all right.

801
01:00:07,630 --> 01:00:10,800
Yeah, um, so, I was
wonderin' if, uh,

802
01:00:10,870 --> 01:00:12,810
if, you know, you'd give me
another crack at it.

803
01:00:12,870 --> 01:00:15,470
You know, let me
take you out again.

804
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:18,210
- I can't.
- All right.

805
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:21,680
Oh, no, I didn't- I didn't mean
I can't, like, ever.

806
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:23,680
I just can't right now.

807
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:26,790
I've got to assign
the proton spectrum for "ebogamine."

808
01:00:26,850 --> 01:00:30,860
All that sounds really, really interesting.
It's actually fantastically boring.

809
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:33,830
- All right, um-
- Maybe some other time.

810
01:00:33,890 --> 01:00:37,930
- Like tomorrow?
- Um, yeah, all right.

811
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,430
- Okay.
- Okay.

812
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:42,870
- Bye.
- Bye.

813
01:00:54,580 --> 01:00:57,110
What are you doing here?

814
01:00:57,180 --> 01:00:59,450
I couldn't wait
till tomorrow.

815
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:02,490
Where the fuck
did you get this?

816
01:01:02,550 --> 01:01:04,660
I had to sleep
with someone in your class.

817
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:10,360
Oh, I hope it was someone with the
open-toed sandals and the really bad breath.

818
01:01:10,430 --> 01:01:14,400
- Come on. Let's go have some fun.
- No, I've got to learn this.

819
01:01:14,470 --> 01:01:17,130
Well, you're not going into
surgery tomorrow, are you?

820
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:19,170
- No.
- Let's go.

821
01:01:23,270 --> 01:01:26,740
Oh, my God!
My dog is winning!

822
01:01:26,810 --> 01:01:29,150
Come on, Misty!

823
01:01:29,210 --> 01:01:31,910
Come on! Run!
Look at that! Come on!

824
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:33,920
Look, there he goes.
Misty, run! Come on!

825
01:01:36,250 --> 01:01:40,490
- We won.
- He totally won.

826
01:01:42,390 --> 01:01:44,660
So did you grow up
around here then?

827
01:01:44,730 --> 01:01:46,930
Not far.
South Boston.

828
01:01:49,530 --> 01:01:51,470
Still glowing from my win.

829
01:01:51,530 --> 01:01:55,170
Look at you.
You're so happy.

830
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:57,270
And what was
that like then?

831
01:01:57,340 --> 01:02:01,010
It was normal, I guess.
Nothin' special.

832
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:04,280
Do you got lots of
brothers and sisters?

833
01:02:04,350 --> 01:02:07,580
- Do I have a lot of brothers and sisters?
- That's what I said.

834
01:02:07,650 --> 01:02:13,220
- Well, Irish Catholic, what do you think?
- Right. That's right.

835
01:02:13,290 --> 01:02:18,260
- How many?
- You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

836
01:02:18,330 --> 01:02:21,860
- Why? Go on. What? Five?
- No.

837
01:02:21,930 --> 01:02:25,200
Seven? Eight?
How many?

838
01:02:25,270 --> 01:02:27,470
- I have 12 big brothers.
- You do not!

839
01:02:27,530 --> 01:02:30,370
No, I swear to God. I swear to God.
I'm lucky 13 right here.

840
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:32,370
Do you know
all their names?

841
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:35,040
Do I- Yeah,
they're my brothers.

842
01:02:35,110 --> 01:02:37,210
What are they called?

843
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:41,620
Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry, Mikey, Davey,
Timmy, Tommy, Joey, Robby, Johnny and Brian.

844
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:44,150
Say it again.

845
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:48,320
Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry, Mikey, Davey,
Timmy, Tommy, Joey, Robby, Johnny and Brian.

846
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:50,990
And Willy.

847
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:52,390
- Willy?
- Yeah.

848
01:02:52,460 --> 01:02:53,960
- Will.
- Wow.

849
01:02:54,030 --> 01:02:57,830
- Do you still see all of them?
- Yeah, well, they all live in Southie.

850
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:00,500
- I'm livin' with three of 'em right now.
- Oh, yeah?

851
01:03:00,570 --> 01:03:02,070
- Yeah.
- I'd like to meet them.

852
01:03:02,140 --> 01:03:04,500
Yeah, we'll do that.

853
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:07,110
Oh, you know,
I read your book last night.

854
01:03:07,170 --> 01:03:09,740
Oh, so you're the one.

855
01:03:09,810 --> 01:03:11,780
Do you still, uh-
Do you still counsel veterans?

856
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:13,150
No, I don't.

857
01:03:13,210 --> 01:03:17,880
- Why not?
- Well, I gave it up when my wife got sick.

858
01:03:17,950 --> 01:03:23,490
You ever wonder what your life would be
like if you, uh, if you never met your wife?

859
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:25,490
What? Wonder if I'd be
better off without her?

860
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:27,690
- No, no, no, I'm not saying, like, better off.
- No.

861
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:31,760
- I didn't mean it like that.
- It's all right. It's an important question.

862
01:03:31,830 --> 01:03:34,100
'Cause you'll have bad times,
but that'll always wake you up...

863
01:03:34,170 --> 01:03:36,430
to the good stuff
you weren't paying attention to.

864
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:39,100
And you don't regret
meetin' your wife?

865
01:03:39,170 --> 01:03:41,870
Why? 'Cause the pain
I feel now?

866
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:47,310
Oh, I got regrets, Will, but I don't
regret a single day I spent with her.

867
01:03:51,150 --> 01:03:54,520
So when did you know, like,
that she was the one for you?

868
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:57,320
October 21, 1975.

869
01:03:57,390 --> 01:03:59,490
Jesus Christ.
You know the fuckin' day?

870
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:04,560
Oh, yeah, 'cause it was game six of the
World Series, biggest game in Red Sox history.

871
01:04:04,630 --> 01:04:09,730
- Yeah, sure.
- My friends and I had slept out all night to get tickets.

872
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:13,300
- You got tickets?
- Yep. Day of the game I was sittin' in a bar,

873
01:04:13,370 --> 01:04:16,870
waitin' for the game to start
and in walks this girl.

874
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:20,310
It was an amazing game though. You know,
bottom of the eighth, Carbo ties it up.

875
01:04:20,380 --> 01:04:22,510
It was 6-6.
It went to 12.

876
01:04:22,580 --> 01:04:26,420
Bottom of the 12th, in stepped
Carlton Fisk, old Pudge.

877
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:28,550
Steps up to the plate.
You know, he's got that weird stance.

878
01:04:28,620 --> 01:04:32,220
- Yeah, yeah. - And then-
Boom! He clocks it, you know.

879
01:04:32,290 --> 01:04:34,960
High fly ball
down the left field line!

880
01:04:35,020 --> 01:04:37,590
Thirty-five thousand people
on their feet, yellin' at the ball.

881
01:04:37,660 --> 01:04:40,200
But that's nothin', 'cause Fisk,
he's wavin' at the ball like a madman.

882
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:42,200
- Yeah, I've seen that.
- "Get over! Get over!

883
01:04:42,260 --> 01:04:43,700
- Right.
- Get over!"

884
01:04:43,770 --> 01:04:48,170
Then it hits the foul pole.
He goes ape-shit, and 35,000 fans...

885
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:50,340
They charge the field,
you know.

886
01:04:50,410 --> 01:04:52,740
Yeah, and he's fuckin'
blowin' people outta the way.

887
01:04:52,810 --> 01:04:54,940
"Get outta the way!
Get outta the way!"

888
01:04:55,010 --> 01:04:58,180
I can't fuckin' believe you had
tickets to that fuckin' game!

889
01:04:58,250 --> 01:05:01,350
- Did you rush the field?
- No, I didn't rush the fuckin' field. I wasn't there.

890
01:05:01,420 --> 01:05:04,420
- What?
- No, I was in a bar, havin' a drink with my future wife.

891
01:05:04,490 --> 01:05:09,090
You missed Pudge Fisk's home run to have a
fuckin' drink with some lady you never met?

892
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:11,360
Yeah, but you should have
seen her. She was a stunner.

893
01:05:11,430 --> 01:05:13,960
- I don't care if-
- Oh, no, no, she lit up the room.

894
01:05:14,030 --> 01:05:17,030
- I don't care if Helen of Troy walks into the room.
- Oh, Helen of Troy!

895
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:19,230
That's game six! Oh, my God,
and who were these friends of yours?

896
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:21,600
- They let you get away with that?
- They had to.

897
01:05:21,670 --> 01:05:25,270
- What did you say to 'em?
- I just slid my ticket across the table.

898
01:05:25,340 --> 01:05:28,440
I said, "Sorry, guys.
I gotta see about a girl."

899
01:05:28,510 --> 01:05:30,680
- "I gotta go see about a girl"?
- Yes!

900
01:05:30,740 --> 01:05:32,750
That's what you said?
They let you get away with that?

901
01:05:32,810 --> 01:05:34,950
Oh, yeah. They saw it
in my eyes that I meant it.

902
01:05:35,010 --> 01:05:38,820
- You're kiddin' me?
- No, I'm not kidding you, Will.

903
01:05:38,890 --> 01:05:41,550
That's why I'm not talkin' right now about
some girl I saw at a bar 20 years ago...

904
01:05:41,620 --> 01:05:44,060
and how I always regretted
not goin' over and talkin' to her.

905
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:47,290
I don't regret the 18 years
I was married to Nancy.

906
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:50,430
I don't regret the six years I had
to give up counseling when she got sick,

907
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:54,230
and I don't regret the last years
when she got really sick.

908
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:56,940
And I sure as hell don't
regret missin' a damn game.

909
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,740
That's regret.

910
01:05:59,810 --> 01:06:02,040
Wow!

911
01:06:07,110 --> 01:06:09,750
Would have been nice
to catch that game though.

912
01:06:09,810 --> 01:06:12,350
I didn't know Pudge
was gonna hit a home run.

913
01:06:14,450 --> 01:06:18,520
You know, I'm very, very
useful on the court.

914
01:06:18,590 --> 01:06:21,690
I'm extremely tall.

915
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:24,630
- You're not that tall.
- I dunk.

916
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:30,730
Will I ever play in the N.B.A.?

917
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:34,370
"It is decidedly so."
Hmph.

918
01:06:36,810 --> 01:06:39,480
Why do we always stay here?

919
01:06:39,540 --> 01:06:42,180
'Cause it's nicer
than my place.

920
01:06:42,250 --> 01:06:44,750
Yes, but I've never
seen your place.

921
01:06:44,810 --> 01:06:47,050
I know.

922
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:49,590
When am I gonna meet
your friends and your brothers?

923
01:06:49,650 --> 01:06:53,120
Well, they don't really
come down here that much.

924
01:06:53,190 --> 01:06:55,330
I think I can make it
to South Boston.

925
01:06:55,390 --> 01:07:00,060
It's kind of a hike.

926
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:03,130
Is it me you're hiding from them
or the other way around?

927
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:05,740
- All right, we'll go.
- When?

928
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:08,240
I don't know.
We'll go sometime next week.

929
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:13,740
What if I said I would not sleep with you
again until you let me meet your friends?

930
01:07:19,420 --> 01:07:23,090
I'd say it's, like, 4:30 in the mornin'.
They're probably up.

931
01:07:23,150 --> 01:07:26,420
Oh, my God.
Men are shameless.

932
01:07:26,490 --> 01:07:30,830
If you're not thinking with your wiener,
then you're acting directly on its behalf.

933
01:07:30,890 --> 01:07:34,460
You bet. And on behalf of my wiener,
can I get an advance payment?

934
01:07:34,530 --> 01:07:39,230
I don't know. Let's ask.
"Outlook does not look good."

935
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:42,700
- What? - Fuck the- Hey, Chuck.
No. Nothing. Go back to sleep.

936
01:07:42,770 --> 01:07:46,010
"Outlook"? That's the same thing that
told you you was gonna play in the N.B.A.

937
01:07:46,070 --> 01:07:50,140
Exactly, so look out. You'd better
start buying some season tickets.

938
01:07:50,210 --> 01:07:55,020
Mmm! I plan to. I'm tall.
I like wearing shorts.

939
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:57,320
Hook, hook. Dunk, dunk.

940
01:07:57,380 --> 01:08:00,190
- You're not that tall.
- Yes, I am.

941
01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:03,290
Maybe I'm all
about three points.

942
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:05,630
I'm all about home runs.

943
01:08:05,690 --> 01:08:09,930
Stop mixing your
sporting metaphors.

944
01:08:21,470 --> 01:08:25,040
A leprechaun's got his dick
in the monkey's ass.

945
01:08:25,110 --> 01:08:28,850
Morgan comes runnin' in, goin',
"I don't mind it. I don't mind-"

946
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:34,620
Well, I can't believe you brought Skylar here
when we're fuckin' all bombed and drinkin'.

947
01:08:34,690 --> 01:08:37,990
I know, Morgan. It's a real rarity
we'd be all drinkin'.

948
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:40,930
My uncle Marty drinks. He'll go
on a bender for six, eight months.

949
01:08:40,990 --> 01:08:43,830
Did I ever tell ya what happened to him when
he was drivin' up there and got pulled over?

950
01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:46,200
- I told you guys, right?
- Marty, yeah.

951
01:08:46,270 --> 01:08:49,870
Let me tell ya what happened to my uncle
Marty, because you oughta know this.

952
01:08:49,940 --> 01:08:53,300
He's always tellin' stories. Every time
we come here he's got another story.

953
01:08:53,370 --> 01:08:57,380
But we all heard this one.
Go ahead. Say it anyway.

954
01:08:57,440 --> 01:09:02,580
I will go ahead. Thanks a lot.
Guess I have the floor now.

955
01:09:02,650 --> 01:09:05,320
My uncle Marty's
drivin' home, right?

956
01:09:05,380 --> 01:09:10,150
Bombed out of his tree, right? Just
hammered out of his gourd. Just wrecked.

957
01:09:10,220 --> 01:09:14,360
This state trooper sees him, pulls him
over. So my uncle's fucked basically.

958
01:09:14,430 --> 01:09:16,660
Got him out of the car,
tryin' to make him walk the line.

959
01:09:16,730 --> 01:09:20,600
He gets out of the car, pukes, and the
statie's pretty sure he's over the legal limit.

960
01:09:20,660 --> 01:09:24,470
So he's about to throw the cuffs
on him and put him in jail.

961
01:09:24,530 --> 01:09:28,610
All of a sudden, 50 yards down the road,
there's this huge fuckin' boom.

962
01:09:28,670 --> 01:09:32,180
- Statie gets real spooked.
He turns around- - He got shot?

963
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:35,210
No. So- So- You
heard this story before.

964
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:37,210
Yeah, Morgan, stop.
Stop.

965
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:40,620
Some other guy's car had hit a tree.
There was an accident.

966
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:42,620
Anyway...

967
01:09:42,690 --> 01:09:44,820
- How could he hear-
- Shut the fuck up!

968
01:09:44,890 --> 01:09:47,860
- You're drivin' him nuts.
- I'm gonna break your neck. Shut up!

969
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:49,890
He told you the story
once before.

970
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:52,660
So he tells my uncle,
"Stay here. Don't move."

971
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:56,670
Statie goes runnin' down the road
to deal with the other accident.

972
01:09:56,730 --> 01:10:00,670
After a few minutes of just
Iyin' in his own piss and vomit,

973
01:10:00,740 --> 01:10:02,740
my uncle starts wonderin'
what he's doin' there.

974
01:10:02,810 --> 01:10:05,340
Gets up, gets in his car
and just drives home.

975
01:10:05,410 --> 01:10:08,410
The next mornin'
my uncle's just passed out.

976
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:10,750
He hears this knockin' at the door.

977
01:10:10,810 --> 01:10:13,750
So he goes downstairs,
pulls the door open- "What?"

978
01:10:13,820 --> 01:10:15,780
It's the state trooper
that pulled him over.

979
01:10:15,850 --> 01:10:17,790
Statie says,
"Fuck you mean, 'What?'

980
01:10:17,850 --> 01:10:21,390
You know what. I pulled you over
last night is what, and you took off."

981
01:10:21,460 --> 01:10:24,030
He's like, "I never
seen you before in my life.

982
01:10:24,090 --> 01:10:26,830
I've been home all night with my kids.
I don't know who the fuck you are."

983
01:10:26,890 --> 01:10:30,200
He's like, "You know who I am.
Let me get in your garage."

984
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:32,600
My uncle's like, "What?" He said, "You
heard me. Let me get in your garage."

985
01:10:32,670 --> 01:10:35,340
He was like, "All right. Fine." Takes
him out to the garage, opens the door.

986
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:40,610
And there's- The statie's police
cruiser is in my uncle's garage.

987
01:10:40,670 --> 01:10:43,180
He was so fuckin'...

988
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:45,710
He was so fuckin' hammered
he drove the wrong car home.

989
01:10:45,780 --> 01:10:49,550
The best part about it is,
the fuckin' state trooper...

990
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:52,050
was so embarrassed
he didn't do anything.

991
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:55,460
He'd been drivin' around all night in my
uncle's Chevelle, lookin' for the house.

992
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:59,560
All right, Chuck, what the fuck
is the point of your story?

993
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:01,860
He got away.
That's the point.

994
01:11:01,930 --> 01:11:05,100
- Well, question-
- Come on. Stop.

995
01:11:05,170 --> 01:11:07,970
- I'm tryin' to clarify somethin'.
- You're embarrassing him.

996
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:10,540
- It doesn't make any sense.
- It does make sense,

997
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:12,570
if you listen to the story
and quit askin' questions.

998
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:15,980
Well, let's see if you can get this one.
I've got a little story for you.

999
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:20,780
All right, there's an old couple
in bed, Mary and Paddie.

1000
01:11:20,850 --> 01:11:26,420
They wake up on the morning
of their 50th anniversary.

1001
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:29,620
Mary looks over and
gazes adoringly at Paddie.

1002
01:11:29,690 --> 01:11:31,760
She's like,
"Oh, Jesus, Paddie.

1003
01:11:31,820 --> 01:11:34,090
You're such a good-looking
feller. I love ya.

1004
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:36,530
I want to give ya
a little present.

1005
01:11:36,590 --> 01:11:39,560
Anything your little heart desires,
I'm goin' to give it to ya.

1006
01:11:39,630 --> 01:11:41,570
What would ya like?

1007
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:46,300
Paddie's like, "Oh, gee, Mary.
That's a very sweet offer.

1008
01:11:46,370 --> 01:11:51,310
Now, in 50 years, there's one thing
that's been missing,

1009
01:11:51,380 --> 01:11:55,150
and, uh, I would like you
to give me a blow job.

1010
01:11:55,210 --> 01:11:58,920
I would like for it."
Mary's like, "All right."

1011
01:11:58,980 --> 01:12:03,420
She takes her teeth out, puts 'em in
the glass. She gives him a blow job.

1012
01:12:03,490 --> 01:12:07,420
Afterwards, Paddie's like, "Yeah, geez,
now that's what I've been missin'.

1013
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:11,400
That was the most beautiful,
earth-shattering thing ever!

1014
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:13,800
Beautiful, Mary!
I love ya!

1015
01:12:13,860 --> 01:12:16,800
Is there anything
that I can do for you?"

1016
01:12:16,870 --> 01:12:21,510
Mary looks up to him and she goes,
"Give us a kiss."

1017
01:12:21,570 --> 01:12:23,870
- Oh!
- Oh, my God!

1018
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:27,340
- That's filthy.
- It's not that filthy. I've heard filthy.

1019
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:35,750
- Get off of me!
- All right. See you guys later.

1020
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:39,090
All right.
Take it easy, Bill.

1021
01:12:39,150 --> 01:12:41,620
So, Skylar,
thanks for comin' by.

1022
01:12:41,690 --> 01:12:43,660
Changed my opinion
of Harvard people.

1023
01:12:43,730 --> 01:12:47,200
You don't want to rush to judgment on
that one, 'cause they're not all like me.

1024
01:12:47,260 --> 01:12:50,000
Oh. I'm sure.
It was nice to meet ya.

1025
01:12:50,070 --> 01:12:52,740
- Oh.
- Take it easy. Slowly back away.

1026
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:56,910
- Oh, come on. Brother.
- I don't know what you're doin', dude.

1027
01:12:56,970 --> 01:12:59,640
- You're givin' us a ride.
- What the fuck do I look like to you?

1028
01:12:59,710 --> 01:13:03,150
- Come on, Chuck.
- You're walkin', bitch. Will's takin' the car.

1029
01:13:03,210 --> 01:13:06,450
All right, thanks, sucker.
I appreciate it.

1030
01:13:06,510 --> 01:13:09,420
I don't know what you're
gettin' all serious about.

1031
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:13,390
- You're droppin' me off first.
- It's really out of the way.

1032
01:13:13,460 --> 01:13:16,360
Oh, okay. Just 'cause you don't have to
sleep in your one-room palace tonight...

1033
01:13:16,420 --> 01:13:18,360
don't start
thinkin' you're bad.

1034
01:13:18,430 --> 01:13:20,690
Hey, wait a minute. You said
we were gonna see your place.

1035
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:23,900
- Not tonight.
- Oh, no, not tonight. Not any other night.

1036
01:13:23,970 --> 01:13:27,570
He knows once you see that shit-hole
he's gettin' dropped like a bad habit.

1037
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:29,670
But I wanted to meet
your brothers.

1038
01:13:29,740 --> 01:13:32,170
We're gonna do that
another time.

1039
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:34,170
All right.

1040
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:38,380
Need them keys.

1041
01:13:38,450 --> 01:13:42,480
The stewardess hears this
and goes haulin' ass down the aisle.

1042
01:13:42,550 --> 01:13:45,890
I yell,
"Don't forget the coffee."

1043
01:13:45,950 --> 01:13:47,990
No shit!
You didn't say that.

1044
01:13:48,050 --> 01:13:50,460
For Christ's sake, Marty,
it's a joke.

1045
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:52,690
- I know someone that actually happened to, Marty.
- A joke.

1046
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:54,360
- Gerry.
- Hi.

1047
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:56,400
- Have trouble findin' the place?
- No, I took a cab.

1048
01:13:56,460 --> 01:14:00,330
Timmy, this is Gerry.
We went to college together.

1049
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:02,570
How you doin'?
Nice to meet ya.

1050
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:04,570
- Pleased to meet you.
- Can I get you a beer?

1051
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:07,110
Um, no, just a Perrier.

1052
01:14:07,170 --> 01:14:09,110
That's French
for club soda.

1053
01:14:09,180 --> 01:14:11,780
- Club soda, yeah.
- Couple of sandwiches too.

1054
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:13,780
- Sure.
- Put it on my tab.

1055
01:14:13,850 --> 01:14:16,110
You ever plannin'
on payin' your tab?

1056
01:14:16,180 --> 01:14:18,380
Yeah, chief, got the winning
lottery ticket right here.

1057
01:14:18,450 --> 01:14:20,120
- What's the jackpot?
- Twelve million.

1058
01:14:20,190 --> 01:14:24,960
- I don't think that'll cover it.
- It'll cover your sex change operation.

1059
01:14:28,260 --> 01:14:32,100
- Nuts?
- No, thank you.

1060
01:14:34,670 --> 01:14:37,770
So, you wanted
to talk about Will.

1061
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:41,710
- Well, it seems to be going well.
- I think so.

1062
01:14:43,110 --> 01:14:45,940
Have you talked to him
at all about his future?

1063
01:14:46,010 --> 01:14:49,710
No, we haven't gotten into that yet.
We're still bangin' away at the past.

1064
01:14:49,780 --> 01:14:53,320
Maybe you should. My phone's been
ringing off the hook with job offers.

1065
01:14:53,380 --> 01:14:57,290
- What kind?
- Cutting edge mathematics, think tanks.

1066
01:14:57,350 --> 01:15:00,690
The kind of place where a mind
like Will's is given free rein.

1067
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:06,430
That's great that there are offers, but
I don't really think he's ready for that.

1068
01:15:10,170 --> 01:15:12,370
I'm not sure
you understand, Sean.

1069
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:15,200
- What don't I understand?
- Here you go, guys.

1070
01:15:15,270 --> 01:15:18,470
- Thanks, Tim.
- Yeah, thank you.

1071
01:15:18,540 --> 01:15:20,880
Just so you don't
get sticky fingers.

1072
01:15:20,940 --> 01:15:23,410
Tim, can you help us?

1073
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:25,920
We're tryin'
to settle a bet.

1074
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:27,380
Uh-oh.

1075
01:15:27,450 --> 01:15:30,890
- Ever heard of Jonas Salk?
- Sure. Cured polio.

1076
01:15:30,950 --> 01:15:33,660
- Ever heard of Albert Einstein?
- Hey.

1077
01:15:35,890 --> 01:15:39,130
How about Gerald Lambeau?
Ever heard of him?

1078
01:15:39,190 --> 01:15:42,930
- No.
- Thank you, Tim.

1079
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,930
- So who won the bet?
- I did.

1080
01:15:46,970 --> 01:15:51,410
This isn't about me, Sean.

1081
01:15:51,470 --> 01:15:54,310
I'm nothing compared
to this young man.

1082
01:15:57,810 --> 01:15:59,780
You ever hear of
Gerald Lambeau?

1083
01:15:59,850 --> 01:16:04,520
In 1905 there were hundreds of professors
renown for their study of the universe.

1084
01:16:04,590 --> 01:16:09,120
But it was a 26-year-old
Swiss patent clerk,

1085
01:16:09,190 --> 01:16:11,830
doing physics in his spare time,
who changed the world.

1086
01:16:11,890 --> 01:16:13,830
Can you imagine if Einstein
would have given that up...

1087
01:16:13,890 --> 01:16:16,430
just to get drunk with his buddies
in Vienna every night.

1088
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:19,130
We all would have
lost something.

1089
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:21,200
Tim would never
have heard of him.

1090
01:16:21,270 --> 01:16:24,370
- Pretty dramatic, Gerry.
- No, it isn't, Sean.

1091
01:16:24,440 --> 01:16:27,040
This boy has that gift.

1092
01:16:27,110 --> 01:16:29,610
He just doesn't got the direction,
but we can give that to him.

1093
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:34,980
Hey, Gerry, in the 1960s, there was a young
man graduated from University of Michigan.

1094
01:16:35,050 --> 01:16:38,320
Did some brilliant work
in mathematics.

1095
01:16:38,380 --> 01:16:40,820
Specifically,
bounded harmonic functions.

1096
01:16:40,890 --> 01:16:43,960
Then he went on to Berkeley. He was
assistant professor. Showed amazing potential.

1097
01:16:44,020 --> 01:16:46,960
Then he moved to Montana, and
he blew the competition away.

1098
01:16:47,030 --> 01:16:49,960
- Yeah, so who was he?
- Ted Kaczynski.

1099
01:16:50,030 --> 01:16:51,900
Haven't heard of him.

1100
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:53,900
- Hey, Timmy!
- Yo!

1101
01:16:53,970 --> 01:16:56,740
- Who's Ted Kaczynski?
- Unabomber.

1102
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:01,740
That's exactly
what I'm talking about.

1103
01:17:01,810 --> 01:17:03,740
- We gotta give this kid direction.
- Yeah...

1104
01:17:03,810 --> 01:17:06,180
He can contribute to the world,
and we can help him do that.

1105
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:08,310
Direction's one thing.
Manipulation's another.

1106
01:17:08,380 --> 01:17:11,250
- Sean-
- We have to let him find...

1107
01:17:11,320 --> 01:17:14,050
I'm not sitting at home every night
twisting my mustache and hatching a plan...

1108
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:16,090
to ruin this boy's life!

1109
01:17:16,150 --> 01:17:18,560
I was doing advanced mathematics
when I was 18,

1110
01:17:18,620 --> 01:17:21,090
and it still took me over 20 years to do
something worthy of a Field's medal.

1111
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:23,590
Maybe he doesn't want
what you want.

1112
01:17:23,660 --> 01:17:26,430
There's more to life
than a fuckin' Field's medal.

1113
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:30,430
This is too important, Sean,
and it's above personal rivalry.

1114
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:32,940
Wait a minute.
Let's talk about the boy.

1115
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,740
Why don't we give him time
to figure out what he wants?

1116
01:17:35,810 --> 01:17:39,080
That's a wonderful theory, Sean.
It worked wonders for you, didn't it?

1117
01:17:39,140 --> 01:17:41,780
Yeah, it did,
you arrogant fuckin' prick!

1118
01:17:43,180 --> 01:17:46,620
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry
that I came here today.

1119
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:48,850
I came here out of courtesy.
I wanted to keep you in the loop.

1120
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:51,050
Nice to be in the loop.

1121
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:54,720
The boy's in a meeting right now
I set up for him over at McNeil.

1122
01:17:54,790 --> 01:17:59,230
Well, Will, I'm not exactly sure
what you mean.

1123
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:01,660
We've already
offered you a position.

1124
01:18:01,730 --> 01:18:03,770
Nobody in this town works
without a retainer, guys.

1125
01:18:03,830 --> 01:18:07,100
You think you can find somebody
who does, you have my blessin'.

1126
01:18:07,170 --> 01:18:10,440
But I think we all know that person is
not gonna represent you as well as I can.

1127
01:18:10,510 --> 01:18:13,640
Will, our offer
is $84,000 a year.

1128
01:18:13,710 --> 01:18:18,450
Retainer!
Retainer.

1129
01:18:18,510 --> 01:18:21,280
You want us to give you
cash right now?

1130
01:18:21,350 --> 01:18:25,420
Whoa-ho-ho. Easy-
Now, I didn't say that.

1131
01:18:25,490 --> 01:18:30,730
Allegedly,
your situation, for you,

1132
01:18:30,790 --> 01:18:34,630
would be concurrently
improved if I had...

1133
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:37,370
$200 in my back pocket
right now.

1134
01:18:37,430 --> 01:18:42,470
I don't think I can- Larry?

1135
01:18:42,540 --> 01:18:46,740
- I've got $73.
- Will you take a check?

1136
01:18:46,810 --> 01:18:51,580
Let me tell you somethin'.
You're suspect.

1137
01:18:51,650 --> 01:18:56,980
Yeah, you. I don't know
what your reputation is in this town,

1138
01:18:57,050 --> 01:18:59,790
but after the shit
you tried to pull today,

1139
01:18:59,850 --> 01:19:02,460
you can bet
I'll be lookin' into you.

1140
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:07,460
Now, any business
we have heretofore,

1141
01:19:07,530 --> 01:19:11,330
you can speak with
my aforementioned attorney.

1142
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:13,570
Good day, gentlemen.

1143
01:19:13,630 --> 01:19:17,370
And until that day comes,
keep your ear to the grindstone.

1144
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:33,620
- How's it goin'?
- Fine.

1145
01:19:33,690 --> 01:19:35,750
Yeah.

1146
01:19:35,820 --> 01:19:37,760
Good.

1147
01:19:38,820 --> 01:19:41,460
- Want some help?
- No!

1148
01:19:41,530 --> 01:19:44,730
Come on. Give me one little peek,
and we'll go to the batting cages.

1149
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:47,000
No.

1150
01:19:47,070 --> 01:19:50,740
It is actually important
that I learn this.

1151
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:54,570
- It's really important... to me, okay?
- All right.

1152
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:59,580
- Why don't we just hang out here all day?
- Yes, why don't we?

1153
01:20:01,950 --> 01:20:05,620
All right, Mr. Nosey Parker.

1154
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:10,450
Seeing as you're intent
on breaking my balls,

1155
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:14,130
- let me ask you a question.
- All right.

1156
01:20:14,190 --> 01:20:16,160
Do you have
a photographic memory?

1157
01:20:18,330 --> 01:20:22,230
I don't know. I just kind of remember. I
mean, how do you remember your phone number?

1158
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:24,230
You just do.

1159
01:20:24,300 --> 01:20:27,200
- Have you studied organic chemistry?
- A little bit.

1160
01:20:27,270 --> 01:20:30,170
- Oh, just for fun?
- Yeah, for kicks.

1161
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:32,810
Yeah, it's so much fun
studying organic chemistry.

1162
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:35,510
Are you mad?

1163
01:20:35,580 --> 01:20:38,110
Have you completely
lost your mind?

1164
01:20:38,180 --> 01:20:42,790
Nobody studies it for fun. It's not a
necessity, especially for someone like you.

1165
01:20:42,850 --> 01:20:45,320
- Someone like me?
- Yeah.

1166
01:20:45,390 --> 01:20:49,660
Someone who divides their time, fairly
evenly, between batting cages and bars.

1167
01:20:49,730 --> 01:20:54,260
- I would hardly say it was a necessity.
- Oh.

1168
01:20:54,330 --> 01:20:57,130
You know, there are very
smart people here at Harvard.

1169
01:20:57,200 --> 01:21:01,170
Even they have to study,
because this is really hard.

1170
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:06,940
And yet... you do it
so easily. I don't understand.

1171
01:21:07,010 --> 01:21:09,080
I don't understand
how your mind works.

1172
01:21:09,140 --> 01:21:11,380
- Did you play the piano?
- I want to talk about this.

1173
01:21:11,450 --> 01:21:13,620
No, I'm trying to explain it to you.
Do you play the piano?

1174
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:18,250
- Yeah, a bit.
- So when you look at a piano, you see Mozart.

1175
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:21,920
- I see "Chopsticks."
- All right, well, Beethoven, okay?

1176
01:21:21,990 --> 01:21:25,790
He looked at a piano, and it just
made sense to him. He could just play.

1177
01:21:25,930 --> 01:21:28,200
- So what are you saying? You play the piano?
- Not a lick.

1178
01:21:28,260 --> 01:21:32,130
I look at a piano, I see a bunch of
keys, three pedals and a box of wood.

1179
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:37,000
But Beethoven, Mozart-
They saw it. They could just play.

1180
01:21:37,070 --> 01:21:41,040
I couldn't paint you a picture. I
probably can't hit the ball out of Fenway.

1181
01:21:41,110 --> 01:21:46,550
- And I can't play the piano. - But you
can do my O- chem paper in under an hour.

1182
01:21:46,610 --> 01:21:52,150
Right. Well, I mean, when it came to
stuff like that, I could always just play.

1183
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:55,490
That's the best
I can explain it.

1184
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:59,560
- Come here. I have to tell you something.
- Huh?

1185
01:21:59,630 --> 01:22:02,400
- I have to tell you something.
- Oh.

1186
01:22:02,460 --> 01:22:04,400
Well...

1187
01:22:18,910 --> 01:22:23,580
- It's not fair.
- What's not fair? What?

1188
01:22:23,650 --> 01:22:26,750
I've been here for four years,

1189
01:22:26,820 --> 01:22:30,260
and I've only just found you.

1190
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:32,690
Well, you found me.

1191
01:22:44,470 --> 01:22:48,340
- Are you awake?
- No.

1192
01:22:49,610 --> 01:22:51,810
Yes, you are.

1193
01:22:59,350 --> 01:23:01,290
What?

1194
01:23:03,290 --> 01:23:06,420
I want you to come
to California with me.

1195
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:15,930
- You sure about that?
- Oh, yeah.

1196
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:19,100
Yeah, but how do you know?

1197
01:23:19,170 --> 01:23:23,340
I don't know.
I just know.

1198
01:23:23,410 --> 01:23:26,180
Yeah, but how do you know?

1199
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:29,310
I know because I feel it.

1200
01:23:29,380 --> 01:23:34,250
- Because that's a really serious thing you're saying.
- I know.

1201
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:36,790
You could be in California
next week...

1202
01:23:36,850 --> 01:23:40,060
and you might find out
something about me you don't like.

1203
01:23:40,120 --> 01:23:42,190
Maybe you wish
you hadn't said that,

1204
01:23:42,260 --> 01:23:44,630
but you know it's such a serious thing
you can't take it back.

1205
01:23:44,690 --> 01:23:47,830
Now I'm stuck in California with someone
that doesn't really want to be with me,

1206
01:23:47,900 --> 01:23:52,430
- just wish they had a take-back.
- A what? What's a take-back?

1207
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:58,410
I don't want a take-back. I just want
you to come to California with me.

1208
01:23:58,470 --> 01:24:02,210
Well, I can't go to
California with you, so...

1209
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:05,210
Why not?

1210
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:09,420
Well, one, because
I got a job here.

1211
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:12,750
And, two,
because I live here.

1212
01:24:12,820 --> 01:24:17,320
Look, um, if you don't love me,
you should just tell me.

1213
01:24:17,390 --> 01:24:19,330
I'm not sayin'
I don't love you.

1214
01:24:19,390 --> 01:24:24,600
Then why? Why won't you come?
What are you so scared of?

1215
01:24:24,670 --> 01:24:27,570
What am I so scared of?

1216
01:24:27,630 --> 01:24:30,400
Well, what aren't
you scared of?

1217
01:24:30,470 --> 01:24:33,440
You live in this safe little world
where no one challenges you...

1218
01:24:33,510 --> 01:24:37,410
Don't tell me about my world.
Don't tell me about my world.

1219
01:24:37,480 --> 01:24:40,050
You just want to have your little fling
with the guy from the other side of town.

1220
01:24:40,110 --> 01:24:42,950
Then you're gonna go off to Stanford.
You're gonna marry some rich prick...

1221
01:24:43,020 --> 01:24:44,950
who your parents
will approve of...

1222
01:24:45,020 --> 01:24:47,020
and just sit around with
the other trust fund babies...

1223
01:24:47,090 --> 01:24:49,920
and talk about how you
went slummin', too, once.

1224
01:24:49,990 --> 01:24:54,390
Why are you saying this?
What is your obsession with this money?

1225
01:24:54,460 --> 01:24:58,960
My father died when I was 13,
and I inherited this money.

1226
01:24:59,030 --> 01:25:04,440
You don't think every day I wake up,
and I wish I could give it back.

1227
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:08,170
That I would give it back in a second if
it meant I could have one more day with him.

1228
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:11,640
But I can't, and that's
my life, and I deal with it.

1229
01:25:11,710 --> 01:25:15,580
So don't put your shit on me
when you're the one that's afraid.

1230
01:25:15,650 --> 01:25:17,580
I'm afraid? What am I afraid of?
What the fuck am I afraid of?

1231
01:25:17,650 --> 01:25:20,190
You're afraid of me. You're afraid
that I won't love you back.

1232
01:25:20,250 --> 01:25:22,450
You know what?
I'm afraid too.

1233
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:25,660
But fuck it, I want to give it a shot.
At least I'm honest with you.

1234
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:29,560
- I'm not honest with you?
- No, what about your 12 brothers?

1235
01:25:29,630 --> 01:25:31,960
All right.

1236
01:25:32,030 --> 01:25:34,160
No, you're not going.
You're not leaving.

1237
01:25:34,230 --> 01:25:38,370
What do you want to know? That I don't
have 12 brothers? That I'm a fuckin' orphan?

1238
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:40,500
- You don't want to hear that.
- I didn't know that.

1239
01:25:40,570 --> 01:25:43,810
You don't want to hear I got fuckin'
cigarettes put out on me when I was little.

1240
01:25:43,870 --> 01:25:46,280
- I didn't know that.
- That this isn't fuckin' surgery.

1241
01:25:46,340 --> 01:25:49,280
The motherfucker stabbed me. You don't
want to hear that shit, Skylar!

1242
01:25:49,350 --> 01:25:51,650
- I do want to hear that.
- Don't tell me you want that shit!

1243
01:25:51,720 --> 01:25:54,880
- I want to help you.
- Help me? What the fuck?

1244
01:25:54,950 --> 01:25:57,720
What do I got, a fuckin' sign
on my back that says, "Save me"?

1245
01:25:57,790 --> 01:25:59,720
- No.
- Do I look like I need that?

1246
01:25:59,790 --> 01:26:01,830
- No, I just want to be with you-
- Don't bullshit me!

1247
01:26:01,890 --> 01:26:05,900
- I love you.
- Don't bullshit me! Don't you fuckin' bullshit me!

1248
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:08,900
I love you.

1249
01:26:08,970 --> 01:26:14,000
I want to hear you say
that you don't love me.

1250
01:26:14,070 --> 01:26:18,170
Because if you say that...

1251
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:21,640
then I won't call you...

1252
01:26:21,710 --> 01:26:25,850
and I won't be in your life.

1253
01:26:29,650 --> 01:26:32,390
I don't love you.

1254
01:27:13,330 --> 01:27:17,530
Most people never get to see
how brilliant they can be.

1255
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:20,370
They don't find teachers
that believe in them.

1256
01:27:20,430 --> 01:27:24,070
They get convinced
they're stupid.

1257
01:27:24,140 --> 01:27:27,110
I hope you appreciate
what he's doing,

1258
01:27:27,170 --> 01:27:30,510
because I've seen how much
he enjoys working with you,

1259
01:27:30,580 --> 01:27:33,550
not against you.

1260
01:27:36,750 --> 01:27:39,390
Hello, Will.

1261
01:27:39,450 --> 01:27:41,750
Tom, can you get us
some coffee?

1262
01:27:41,820 --> 01:27:43,760
Sure.

1263
01:27:47,290 --> 01:27:50,430
Now, let's see.

1264
01:27:55,370 --> 01:27:58,600
Good. This is correct.

1265
01:28:00,070 --> 01:28:02,470
I see you used Maclaurin here.

1266
01:28:02,540 --> 01:28:05,610
Yeah, I don't know what
you call it, but...

1267
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:09,950
This can't be right.

1268
01:28:11,020 --> 01:28:13,920
This would be
very embarrassing.

1269
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:19,990
- Did you ever consider-
- I'm pretty sure it's right.

1270
01:28:20,060 --> 01:28:22,230
Hey, look, can we do this
at Sean's office from now on?

1271
01:28:22,290 --> 01:28:26,430
Because I got to knock off work to come
here and the commute is killin' me.

1272
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:30,130
- Yeah, sure. Did you think of
the possibility- - That's right.

1273
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:35,410
It's right.
Just take it home with you.

1274
01:28:38,580 --> 01:28:40,540
What happened
at the McNeil meeting?

1275
01:28:40,610 --> 01:28:42,610
I couldn't go.
I had a date.

1276
01:28:42,680 --> 01:28:45,820
So I sent my
chief negotiator.

1277
01:28:49,620 --> 01:28:53,360
On your own time, you can do
whatever you like, Will.

1278
01:28:53,420 --> 01:28:56,060
But when I set up a meeting
with my associates,

1279
01:28:56,130 --> 01:28:58,800
and you don't show up,
it reflects poorly on me.

1280
01:28:58,860 --> 01:29:01,060
- Then don't set up any more meetings.
- I won't.

1281
01:29:01,130 --> 01:29:03,570
I'll cancel 'em.

1282
01:29:03,630 --> 01:29:07,200
I'll give you a job myself. I just
wanted you to see what was out there.

1283
01:29:07,340 --> 01:29:10,410
Maybe I don't want to spend the rest of
my fuckin' life explainin' shit to people.

1284
01:29:17,550 --> 01:29:19,950
I think you could show me
some appreciation.

1285
01:29:20,010 --> 01:29:24,450
A little appreciation?
Do you know how easy this is for me?

1286
01:29:24,550 --> 01:29:27,860
Do you have any fuckin' idea how easy
this is? This is a fuckin' joke.

1287
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:30,020
I'm sorry you can't do this-
I really am...

1288
01:29:30,090 --> 01:29:35,530
Because I wouldn't have to fuckin' sit here
and watch you fumble around and fuck it up.

1289
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:42,640
Then you'd have more time to sit around
and get drunk instead, wouldn't you?

1290
01:29:42,700 --> 01:29:47,310
You're right. This is probably
a total waste of my time.

1291
01:30:01,390 --> 01:30:03,560
You're right, Will.

1292
01:30:05,790 --> 01:30:10,400
I can't do this proof,
but you can.

1293
01:30:10,460 --> 01:30:14,470
And when it comes to that, it's only about
just a handful of people in the world...

1294
01:30:14,570 --> 01:30:16,700
who can tell the difference
between you and me.

1295
01:30:16,770 --> 01:30:19,040
- But I'm one of them.
- Sorry.

1296
01:30:19,110 --> 01:30:21,170
Yeah, so am I.

1297
01:30:21,270 --> 01:30:26,410
Most days I wish
I never met you,

1298
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:29,120
because then I could
sleep at night.

1299
01:30:29,180 --> 01:30:35,090
I didn't have to walk around with the knowledge
that there was someone like you out there.

1300
01:30:41,430 --> 01:30:45,860
I didn't have to watch you
throw it all away.

1301
01:30:52,040 --> 01:30:57,410
Bill, hold it. Did you hear that?

1302
01:30:57,480 --> 01:30:59,410
Morgan!

1303
01:30:59,480 --> 01:31:04,920
If you're watchin' pornos in my mom's room
again, I'm gonna give you a fuckin' beatin'!

1304
01:31:20,860 --> 01:31:23,900
What's up, fellas?

1305
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:28,570
Morgan, why don't you jerk off in your
own fuckin' house. That's fuckin' filthy.

1306
01:31:28,670 --> 01:31:32,810
I don't have a V.C.R.
in my house.

1307
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:35,550
Come on. Not in my glove.

1308
01:31:35,610 --> 01:31:38,010
I didn't use the glove.

1309
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:41,620
That's my
Little League glove.

1310
01:31:41,720 --> 01:31:45,150
What do you want me
to do?

1311
01:31:45,220 --> 01:31:47,320
I mean, what's wrong
with you?

1312
01:31:47,420 --> 01:31:49,590
You'll hump
a baseball glove?

1313
01:31:49,660 --> 01:31:52,830
I- I just used it
for cleanup.

1314
01:31:52,900 --> 01:31:56,600
Stop jerkin' off in my mother's room.

1315
01:31:56,670 --> 01:31:59,840
- Is there another V.C.R. in the house?
- It's just sad, bro.

1316
01:32:01,570 --> 01:32:06,440
So why do you think I should work
for the National Security Agency?

1317
01:32:06,510 --> 01:32:09,580
Well, you'd be working
on the cutting edge.

1318
01:32:09,680 --> 01:32:13,080
You'd be exposed to the kind of
technology you wouldn't see anywhere else,

1319
01:32:13,150 --> 01:32:15,720
because we've classified it.

1320
01:32:15,820 --> 01:32:19,490
Superstring theory,
chaos math, advanced algorithms.

1321
01:32:19,550 --> 01:32:22,490
Code breaking.

1322
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:25,360
That's one aspect
of what we do.

1323
01:32:25,430 --> 01:32:28,060
Oh, come on.
That is what you do.

1324
01:32:28,130 --> 01:32:30,560
You guys handle 80% of
the intelligence workload.

1325
01:32:30,630 --> 01:32:33,130
You're seven times
the size of the C.I.A.

1326
01:32:33,230 --> 01:32:39,040
We don't like to brag about that, Will,
but you're exactly right.

1327
01:32:39,110 --> 01:32:42,980
So the way I see it,
the question isn't:

1328
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:45,710
"Why should you work
for the N.S.A.?"

1329
01:32:45,780 --> 01:32:48,250
The question is:
"Why shouldn't you?"

1330
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:52,220
Why shouldn't
I work for the N.S.A.?

1331
01:32:52,290 --> 01:32:56,220
That's a tough one,
but I'll take a shot.

1332
01:32:56,290 --> 01:32:59,030
Say I'm workin' at the N.S.A.
and somebody puts a code on my desk.

1333
01:32:59,090 --> 01:33:01,030
Something no one else
can break.

1334
01:33:01,090 --> 01:33:03,030
Maybe I take a shot at it
and maybe I break it.

1335
01:33:03,100 --> 01:33:05,600
I'm real happy with myself
because I did my job well.

1336
01:33:05,700 --> 01:33:09,240
But maybe that code was the location of some
rebel army in North Africa or Middle East.

1337
01:33:09,340 --> 01:33:12,370
Once they have that location, they bomb
the village where the rebels are hidin'.

1338
01:33:12,470 --> 01:33:16,710
Fifteen hundred people that I never met,
never had no problem with, get killed.

1339
01:33:16,780 --> 01:33:19,750
Now the politicians are saying, "Send in
the Marines to secure the area,"

1340
01:33:19,810 --> 01:33:21,750
'cause they don't give a shit.

1341
01:33:21,810 --> 01:33:23,750
It won't be their kid
over there gettin' shot,

1342
01:33:23,820 --> 01:33:26,790
just like it wasn't them when their number got
called 'cause they were in the National Guard.

1343
01:33:26,850 --> 01:33:29,720
It'll be some kid from Southie
over there takin' shrapnel in the ass.

1344
01:33:29,790 --> 01:33:31,760
He comes back to find the plant
he used to work at...

1345
01:33:31,860 --> 01:33:34,330
got exported to the country
he got back from,

1346
01:33:34,390 --> 01:33:36,730
and the guy who put the shrapnel
in his ass got his old job...

1347
01:33:36,790 --> 01:33:39,660
'cause he'll work for 15 cents
a day and no bathroom breaks.

1348
01:33:39,730 --> 01:33:42,330
Meanwhile, he realizes the only reason
he was over there in the first place...

1349
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:45,500
was so we could install a government
that would sell us oil at a good price.

1350
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:49,610
Of course, the oil companies used a skirmish
over there to scare up domestic oil prices.

1351
01:33:49,710 --> 01:33:53,810
A cute little ancillary benefit for them, but
it ain't helpin' my buddy at 2.50 a gallon.

1352
01:33:53,880 --> 01:33:56,210
They're takin' their sweet time
bringin' the oil, of course.

1353
01:33:56,280 --> 01:33:58,420
Maybe they even took the liberty
to hire an alcoholic skipper,

1354
01:33:58,480 --> 01:34:01,690
who likes to drink martinis and fuckin'
play slalom with the icebergs.

1355
01:34:01,750 --> 01:34:04,020
It ain't too long till
he hits one, spills the oil...

1356
01:34:04,090 --> 01:34:06,560
and kills all the sea life
in the North Atlantic.

1357
01:34:06,620 --> 01:34:08,930
So now my buddy's out of work,
he can't afford to drive,

1358
01:34:08,990 --> 01:34:10,930
so he's walkin' to
the fuckin' job interviews...

1359
01:34:10,990 --> 01:34:13,760
which sucks because the shrapnel in his
ass is givin' him chronic hemorrhoids.

1360
01:34:13,830 --> 01:34:16,330
Meanwhile, he's starvin', 'cause every
time he tries to get a bite to eat,

1361
01:34:16,430 --> 01:34:18,370
the only blue plate special
they're servin'...

1362
01:34:18,430 --> 01:34:21,370
is North Atlantic scrod
with Quaker State.

1363
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:26,440
So what did I think?
I'm holdin' out for somethin' better.

1364
01:34:26,540 --> 01:34:30,380
I figure, fuck it. While I'm at it,
why not just shoot my buddy,

1365
01:34:30,450 --> 01:34:32,380
take his job,
give it to his sworn enemy,

1366
01:34:32,450 --> 01:34:34,950
hike up gas prices, bomb
a village, club a baby seal,

1367
01:34:35,050 --> 01:34:37,720
hit the hash pipe
and join the National Guard?

1368
01:34:37,790 --> 01:34:40,320
I can be
elected president.

1369
01:34:40,420 --> 01:34:43,690
- You feel like you're alone?
- What?

1370
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:47,400
Do you have a soul mate?

1371
01:34:47,460 --> 01:34:49,970
Do I have a-
Define that.

1372
01:34:50,070 --> 01:34:52,000
Somebody who challenges you.

1373
01:34:52,070 --> 01:34:57,940
- Uh, Chuckie.
- No, Chuckie's family. He'd lie down in fuckin' traffic for you.

1374
01:34:58,010 --> 01:35:03,680
I'm talking about someone who opens
up things for you, touches your soul.

1375
01:35:03,750 --> 01:35:06,910
- I got- I got-
- Who?

1376
01:35:06,980 --> 01:35:10,020
- I got plenty.
- Well, name 'em.

1377
01:35:10,120 --> 01:35:13,120
Shakespeare, Nietzsche, Frost,
O'Connor, Kant, Pope, Locke...

1378
01:35:13,220 --> 01:35:15,420
That's great.
They're all dead.

1379
01:35:15,490 --> 01:35:18,590
- Not to me they're not.
- You don't have a lot of dialogue with them.

1380
01:35:18,690 --> 01:35:22,100
You can't give back
to them, Will.

1381
01:35:22,160 --> 01:35:26,530
- Not without some serious smelling salts and a heater.
- That's what I'm saying.

1382
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:30,140
You'll never have that kind
of relationship in a world...

1383
01:35:30,240 --> 01:35:32,670
where you're always afraid
to take the first step,

1384
01:35:32,740 --> 01:35:36,540
because all you see is every
negative thing ten miles down the road.

1385
01:35:36,610 --> 01:35:38,610
- You gonna take the professor's side on this?
- Don't give me a line of shit.

1386
01:35:38,710 --> 01:35:40,650
- No.
- I didn't want the job.

1387
01:35:40,710 --> 01:35:42,680
It's not about the job. I don't care
if you work for the government.

1388
01:35:42,750 --> 01:35:45,890
But you can do anything you want.
You are bound by nothing.

1389
01:35:45,950 --> 01:35:50,960
What are you passionate about?
What do you want?

1390
01:35:51,060 --> 01:35:53,430
There are guys who work
their entire life layin' brick...

1391
01:35:53,490 --> 01:35:55,760
so their kids have a chance
at the opportunities you have here.

1392
01:35:55,830 --> 01:35:58,300
- I didn't ask for this.
- No.

1393
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:00,870
You were born with it, so don't cop out
behind: "I didn't ask for this."

1394
01:36:00,930 --> 01:36:04,740
- What do you mean, cop out? What's wrong with layin' brick?
- Nothing.

1395
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:07,110
There's nothin' wrong.
That's somebody's home I'm buildin'.

1396
01:36:07,170 --> 01:36:10,040
Right. My dad
laid brick, okay?

1397
01:36:10,110 --> 01:36:12,040
Busted his ass so
I could have an education.

1398
01:36:12,110 --> 01:36:14,310
Exactly. That's
an honorable profession.

1399
01:36:14,380 --> 01:36:16,310
What's wrong with
fixin' somebody's car?

1400
01:36:16,380 --> 01:36:18,320
Someone will get to work the next day
because of me. That's honor in that.

1401
01:36:18,380 --> 01:36:20,320
Yeah, there is, Will.
There is honor in that.

1402
01:36:20,390 --> 01:36:22,720
There's honor in takin'
that 40-minute train ride...

1403
01:36:22,790 --> 01:36:25,260
so those college kids could come in in
the morning and their floors are clean.

1404
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:28,360
- And their wastebaskets are empty. That's real work.
- That's right.

1405
01:36:28,460 --> 01:36:31,430
And that's honorable. I'm sure
that's why you took that job.

1406
01:36:31,530 --> 01:36:33,530
I mean, for the honor of it.

1407
01:36:33,630 --> 01:36:38,270
I just have a little question here.
You could be a janitor anywhere.

1408
01:36:38,340 --> 01:36:42,040
Why did you work at the most prestigious
technical college in the whole fuckin' world?

1409
01:36:42,110 --> 01:36:45,410
Why did you sneak around at night
and finish other people's formulas...

1410
01:36:45,480 --> 01:36:51,380
that only one or two people in the world
could do and then lie about it?

1411
01:36:51,450 --> 01:36:54,420
'Cause I don't see
a lot of honor in that, Will.

1412
01:36:57,620 --> 01:37:00,290
So what do you
really wanna do?

1413
01:37:03,660 --> 01:37:05,630
I wanna be a shepherd.

1414
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:07,560
Really?

1415
01:37:07,630 --> 01:37:11,600
I wanna move up to Nashua, get a nice little
spread, get some sheep and tend to them.

1416
01:37:11,670 --> 01:37:14,600
- Maybe you should go do that.
- What?

1417
01:37:14,670 --> 01:37:17,640
You know, if you're gonna jerk off, why don't
you just do it at home with a moist towel?

1418
01:37:17,710 --> 01:37:19,680
- You're chuckin' me?
- Yeah, get the fuck outta here.

1419
01:37:19,740 --> 01:37:21,710
- No, no, no, time's not up yet.
- Yeah, it is.

1420
01:37:21,780 --> 01:37:24,450
- I'm not leavin'. No.
- You're not gonna answer, you're wastin' my time.

1421
01:37:24,510 --> 01:37:26,480
I thought we were friends.

1422
01:37:26,550 --> 01:37:30,190
- Playtime's over, okay?
- Why are you kickin' me out?

1423
01:37:30,250 --> 01:37:33,590
You're lecturin' me on life?
Look at you, you fuckin' burnout.

1424
01:37:33,660 --> 01:37:35,890
- What winds your clock?
- Workin' with you.

1425
01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:39,060
Where's your soul mate? You wanna
talk about soul mates? Where is she?

1426
01:37:39,130 --> 01:37:41,260
- Dead.
- That's right. She's fuckin' dead.

1427
01:37:41,330 --> 01:37:44,070
She fuckin' dies and you just cash in
your chips and you walk away?

1428
01:37:44,130 --> 01:37:48,340
- At least I played a hand.
- You played a hand and you lost. You lost a big fuckin' hand.

1429
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:51,810
Some people will lose a big hand like
that and have the sack to ante up again.

1430
01:37:51,870 --> 01:37:54,980
Look at me.
What do you wanna do?

1431
01:38:01,920 --> 01:38:06,150
You and your bullshit.
You got a bullshit answer for everybody.

1432
01:38:06,220 --> 01:38:09,960
But I ask you a very simple question and
you can't give me a straight answer,

1433
01:38:10,020 --> 01:38:13,990
because you don't know.

1434
01:38:15,660 --> 01:38:17,860
I'll see ya, Bo-peep.

1435
01:38:20,830 --> 01:38:22,970
- Fuck you.
- You're the shepherd.

1436
01:38:27,710 --> 01:38:29,940
Shepherd.

1437
01:38:30,010 --> 01:38:32,110
White little prick.

1438
01:38:33,350 --> 01:38:35,310
I just wanted to,
you know, um,

1439
01:38:35,380 --> 01:38:38,890
call you up,
uh, before you left, um...

1440
01:38:38,950 --> 01:38:41,590
I've been takin' all these
jobs interviews and stuff,

1441
01:38:41,650 --> 01:38:43,590
so I'm not gonna be just
a construction worker.

1442
01:38:43,660 --> 01:38:46,360
Well, you know, I never
really cared about that.

1443
01:38:47,860 --> 01:38:49,830
Yeah.

1444
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:54,330
I love you.

1445
01:38:58,670 --> 01:39:01,170
Will?

1446
01:39:01,240 --> 01:39:04,080
You take care.

1447
01:39:04,140 --> 01:39:07,710
# Someone's always
comin' around here #

1448
01:39:07,780 --> 01:39:10,420
- # Trailin' some new kill #
- Bye.

1449
01:39:12,580 --> 01:39:16,020
# Says, I seen your picture
on a #

1450
01:39:16,090 --> 01:39:19,620
# Hundred-dollar bill #

1451
01:39:19,690 --> 01:39:23,890
# What's a game of chance
to you #

1452
01:39:23,960 --> 01:39:27,260
# In this world #

1453
01:39:27,330 --> 01:39:29,430
# Of real skill #

1454
01:39:29,500 --> 01:39:31,500
# So glad to meet ya #

1455
01:39:31,570 --> 01:39:35,770
# Angeles #

1456
01:39:37,540 --> 01:39:44,010
# Pickin' up the ticket
shows there's money to be made #

1457
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:47,680
# Go on, lose the gamble #

1458
01:39:47,750 --> 01:39:52,320
# That's the history
of the trade #

1459
01:39:52,390 --> 01:39:57,630
# Did you add up
all the cards left to play #

1460
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:01,760
# To zero #

1461
01:40:01,830 --> 01:40:04,770
# And sign up with people #

1462
01:40:04,830 --> 01:40:08,870
# Angeles #

1463
01:40:08,940 --> 01:40:12,570
# Don't start with me
tryin' #

1464
01:40:14,940 --> 01:40:17,650
Will, come on.
Will!

1465
01:40:19,710 --> 01:40:21,820
Will, that's it!
We're done!

1466
01:40:21,880 --> 01:40:26,620
I'm sitting in your office
and the boy isn't here.

1467
01:40:26,690 --> 01:40:28,720
Well, it's ten past 5:00.

1468
01:40:28,790 --> 01:40:30,830
An hour and
ten minutes late.

1469
01:40:30,890 --> 01:40:34,230
# I can make you satisfied
in everything #

1470
01:40:34,300 --> 01:40:37,800
Well, if he doesn't show up and I file
a report saying he wasn't here...

1471
01:40:37,870 --> 01:40:41,770
and he goes back to jail,
he won't be on my conscience.

1472
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:44,710
# Now be coming true #

1473
01:40:44,770 --> 01:40:47,780
Okay. Fine.

1474
01:40:49,310 --> 01:40:52,110
What's up?

1475
01:40:53,180 --> 01:40:55,120
Thanks.

1476
01:40:57,750 --> 01:41:01,660
Ah! God, that's good.

1477
01:41:05,460 --> 01:41:07,960
So how's your lady?

1478
01:41:08,030 --> 01:41:10,860
Ah, she's gone.

1479
01:41:10,930 --> 01:41:13,270
Gone? Gone where?

1480
01:41:13,330 --> 01:41:17,000
Med school.
Medical school in California.

1481
01:41:17,070 --> 01:41:19,000
- Really?
- Yeah.

1482
01:41:19,070 --> 01:41:22,040
- When was this?
- It was, like, a week ago.

1483
01:41:26,410 --> 01:41:28,350
That sucks.

1484
01:41:31,350 --> 01:41:34,890
So, uh, when are you done
with those meetings?

1485
01:41:34,950 --> 01:41:36,990
I think the week
after I'm 21.

1486
01:41:37,060 --> 01:41:39,790
They gonna hook ya up
with a job or what?

1487
01:41:39,860 --> 01:41:44,100
Yeah, fuckin' sit in a room and do
long division for the next 50 years.

1488
01:41:44,160 --> 01:41:47,570
Nah, probably make
some nice bank though.

1489
01:41:47,630 --> 01:41:49,600
I'm gonna be
a fuckin' lab rat.

1490
01:41:49,670 --> 01:41:53,040
Better than this shit.
Way outta here.

1491
01:41:53,100 --> 01:41:55,340
What do I want a way
outta here for?

1492
01:41:55,410 --> 01:41:57,680
I mean, I'm gonna fuckin'
live here the rest of my life.

1493
01:41:57,740 --> 01:41:59,840
You know, be neighbors.
You know, have little kids.

1494
01:41:59,910 --> 01:42:04,520
Fuckin' take 'em to Little League
together up Foley Field.

1495
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:09,490
Look, you're my best friend,
so don't take this the wrong way.

1496
01:42:09,550 --> 01:42:12,460
But in 20 years if
you're still livin' here,

1497
01:42:12,520 --> 01:42:15,790
comin' over to my house
to watch the Patriots games,

1498
01:42:15,860 --> 01:42:18,160
still workin' construction,
I'll fuckin' kill ya.

1499
01:42:18,230 --> 01:42:20,800
That's not a threat. That's a fact.
I'll fuckin' kill ya.

1500
01:42:20,860 --> 01:42:23,030
What the fuck
are you talkin' about?

1501
01:42:23,100 --> 01:42:26,300
- Look, you got something none of us have.
- Oh, come on!

1502
01:42:26,370 --> 01:42:30,240
Why is it always this? I fuckin'
owe it to myself to do this or that.

1503
01:42:30,310 --> 01:42:34,480
- What if I don't want to?
- No, no, no. Fuck you. You don't owe it to yourself.

1504
01:42:34,540 --> 01:42:36,780
You owe it to me,

1505
01:42:36,850 --> 01:42:39,420
'cause tomorrow I'm gonna
wake up and I'll be 50,

1506
01:42:39,480 --> 01:42:41,980
and I'll still
be doin' this shit.

1507
01:42:42,050 --> 01:42:44,590
That's all right.
That's fine.

1508
01:42:44,650 --> 01:42:47,260
I mean, you're sittin' on
a winnin' lottery ticket.

1509
01:42:47,320 --> 01:42:51,030
You're too much of a pussy
to cash it in, and that's bullshit.

1510
01:42:53,060 --> 01:42:55,970
'Cause I'd do fuckin' anything
to have what you got.

1511
01:42:56,030 --> 01:42:58,900
So would any of
these fuckin' guys.

1512
01:42:58,970 --> 01:43:01,640
Be an insult to us
if you're still here in 20 years.

1513
01:43:01,700 --> 01:43:04,270
Hangin' around here
is a fuckin' waste of your time.

1514
01:43:04,340 --> 01:43:06,480
- You don't know that.
- I don't?

1515
01:43:06,540 --> 01:43:10,050
- No. You don't know that.
- Oh, I don't know that. Let me tell you what I do know.

1516
01:43:10,110 --> 01:43:13,980
Every day I come by your house,
and I pick you up.

1517
01:43:14,050 --> 01:43:18,050
We go out and have a few drinks
and few laughs, and it's great.

1518
01:43:18,120 --> 01:43:20,820
You know what the
best part of my day is?

1519
01:43:20,890 --> 01:43:25,290
It's for about ten seconds: from when I pull
up to the curb and when I get to your door.

1520
01:43:25,360 --> 01:43:30,060
'Cause I think maybe I'll get up there and
I'll knock on the door and you won't be there.

1521
01:43:30,130 --> 01:43:33,600
No "good-bye," no "see ya later."
No nothing. You just left.

1522
01:43:33,670 --> 01:43:37,970
I don't know much,
but I know that.

1523
01:43:50,350 --> 01:43:52,820
This is a disaster, Sean.

1524
01:43:52,920 --> 01:43:55,260
I brought you in here because
I wanted you to help me with the boy,

1525
01:43:55,360 --> 01:43:57,320
- not to run him out.
- I know what I'm doing with the boy.

1526
01:43:57,420 --> 01:43:59,390
I don't care if you have
a rapport with the boy!

1527
01:43:59,460 --> 01:44:02,060
I don't care if you have a few laughs,
even at my expense.

1528
01:44:02,160 --> 01:44:04,900
- But don't you dare undermine what I'm trying to do here.
- Undermine?

1529
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,030
This boy is at
a fragile point right now.

1530
01:44:07,130 --> 01:44:10,100
I do understand. He is at
a fragile point. He's got problems.

1531
01:44:10,200 --> 01:44:13,740
What problems does he have? That he's
better off as a janitor, in jail?

1532
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:16,910
Better hanging out with
a bunch of retarded gorillas?

1533
01:44:17,010 --> 01:44:20,980
Why do you think he does that?
You have any fuckin' clue why?

1534
01:44:21,080 --> 01:44:24,580
He can handle the problems. He can
handle the work. He obviously handled you.

1535
01:44:24,680 --> 01:44:27,220
Listen to me.
Why is he hiding?

1536
01:44:27,320 --> 01:44:29,250
Why doesn't
he trust anybody?

1537
01:44:29,320 --> 01:44:31,260
Because the first thing
that happened to him,

1538
01:44:31,320 --> 01:44:33,260
he was abandoned by the people
who were supposed to love him the most.

1539
01:44:33,330 --> 01:44:35,330
Don't give me
that Freudian crap.

1540
01:44:35,430 --> 01:44:37,730
Why does he hang out with those
retarded gorillas, as you call them?

1541
01:44:37,830 --> 01:44:41,400
Because any one of them, if he asked
them to, would take a bat to your head.

1542
01:44:41,500 --> 01:44:44,440
- That's called loyalty.
- Yeah, that's very touching.

1543
01:44:44,500 --> 01:44:47,640
Who's he handling? He pushes people away
before they have a chance to leave him.

1544
01:44:47,740 --> 01:44:50,240
It's a defense mechanism,
all right?

1545
01:44:50,340 --> 01:44:53,040
For 20 years, he's been
alone because of that.

1546
01:44:53,140 --> 01:44:55,780
If you push him right now, it's gonna
be the same thing all over again.

1547
01:44:55,880 --> 01:44:57,820
I'm not gonna
let that happen to him.

1548
01:44:57,880 --> 01:44:59,820
- Don't you do that.
- What?

1549
01:44:59,880 --> 01:45:03,650
Don't infect him with the idea that it's
okay to quit, that it's okay to be a failure.

1550
01:45:03,750 --> 01:45:05,690
Because it's not okay, Sean!

1551
01:45:05,760 --> 01:45:09,530
And if you're angry at me for being successful,
for being what you could have been...

1552
01:45:09,630 --> 01:45:12,430
- I'm not angry at you.
- Oh, yes, you're angry at me.

1553
01:45:12,530 --> 01:45:16,630
You resent me, but I'm not gonna
apologize for any success I've had.

1554
01:45:16,730 --> 01:45:19,470
You're angry at me for doing
what you could have done!

1555
01:45:19,570 --> 01:45:21,670
But ask yourself, Sean-
Ask yourself...

1556
01:45:21,770 --> 01:45:25,170
if you want Will to feel that way-
if you want him to feel like a failure?

1557
01:45:25,240 --> 01:45:27,240
You arrogant shit!

1558
01:45:27,340 --> 01:45:31,810
That's why I don't come to the goddamn reunions,
'cause I can't stand that look in your eye.

1559
01:45:31,910 --> 01:45:34,920
- That condescending, embarrassed look.
- Oh, come on, Sean.

1560
01:45:35,020 --> 01:45:36,990
You think I'm a failure.
I know who I am.

1561
01:45:37,090 --> 01:45:41,560
I'm proud of what I do. It was
a conscious choice. I didn't fuck up!

1562
01:45:41,660 --> 01:45:44,360
And you and your cronies think
I'm some sort of pity case.

1563
01:45:44,460 --> 01:45:48,060
You and your kiss-ass chorus following
you around going, "The Field's medal!"

1564
01:45:48,160 --> 01:45:51,470
Why are you still so
fuckin' afraid of failure?

1565
01:45:51,570 --> 01:45:55,640
It's about my medal, isn't it? Oh, God, I could
go home and get it for you. You can have it.

1566
01:45:55,740 --> 01:45:58,710
Shove the medal up
your fuckin' ass, all right?

1567
01:45:58,770 --> 01:46:00,780
'Cause I don't give
a shit about your medal,

1568
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:02,840
because I knew you before
you were a mathematical god,

1569
01:46:02,910 --> 01:46:06,510
when you were pimple-faced and homesick and
didn't know what side of the bed to piss on.

1570
01:46:06,610 --> 01:46:08,580
Yeah, you were smarter than me then
and you're smarter than me now.

1571
01:46:08,680 --> 01:46:10,620
So don't blame me for
how your life turned out.

1572
01:46:10,690 --> 01:46:13,090
I don't blame you!
It's not about you!

1573
01:46:13,150 --> 01:46:15,890
You mathematical dick!
It's about the boy!

1574
01:46:15,990 --> 01:46:20,960
He's a good kid! And I won't see you fuck him
up like you're tryin' to fuck up me right now.

1575
01:46:21,060 --> 01:46:23,560
I won't see you make him
feel like a failure too!

1576
01:46:23,660 --> 01:46:27,100
- He won't be a failure!
- But if you push him! If you ride him!

1577
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:32,840
I am what I am today because I was pushed
and because I learned to push myself.

1578
01:46:32,940 --> 01:46:34,980
He's not you!
You get that!

1579
01:46:37,110 --> 01:46:38,950
I can come back.

1580
01:46:39,050 --> 01:46:43,080
No, come in.
Uh, I was just leaving.

1581
01:46:53,330 --> 01:46:57,260
A lot of that stuff goes back
a long way between me and him.

1582
01:46:57,360 --> 01:46:59,360
You know. Not about you.

1583
01:47:02,540 --> 01:47:06,100
What is that?

1584
01:47:06,210 --> 01:47:10,510
This is your file. I have to send it
back to the judge for evaluation.

1585
01:47:10,610 --> 01:47:15,710
Oh. Hey, you're not
gonna fail me, are you?

1586
01:47:19,420 --> 01:47:21,590
What's it say?

1587
01:47:22,990 --> 01:47:25,660
- Wanna read it?
- Why?

1588
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:30,560
Have you had any, uh,
experience with that?

1589
01:47:30,660 --> 01:47:34,230
Twenty years of counseling.
Yeah, I've seen some pretty awful shit.

1590
01:47:34,330 --> 01:47:38,640
I mean, have you had
any experience with that?

1591
01:47:42,670 --> 01:47:46,180
- Personally?
- Yeah.

1592
01:47:46,280 --> 01:47:48,210
Yeah, I have.

1593
01:47:48,280 --> 01:47:50,280
It sure ain't good.

1594
01:47:53,720 --> 01:47:55,820
My father was an alcoholic.

1595
01:47:55,920 --> 01:47:58,720
Mean fuckin' drunk.

1596
01:48:00,360 --> 01:48:03,330
He'd come home hammered,
lookin' to whale on somebody.

1597
01:48:03,430 --> 01:48:07,930
So I'd provoke him so he wouldn't go
after my mother and little brother.

1598
01:48:08,030 --> 01:48:12,170
Interesting nights
when he wore his rings.

1599
01:48:13,270 --> 01:48:16,710
He used to just
put a wrench,

1600
01:48:16,810 --> 01:48:19,540
a stick and a belt
on the table.

1601
01:48:19,640 --> 01:48:23,650
- Just say, "Choose."
- Well, I gotta go with the belt there.

1602
01:48:23,750 --> 01:48:25,710
I used to go with the wrench.

1603
01:48:25,780 --> 01:48:27,750
Why the wrench?

1604
01:48:27,850 --> 01:48:30,190
'Cause fuck him, that's why.

1605
01:48:30,290 --> 01:48:33,860
- Your foster father?
- Yeah.

1606
01:48:33,960 --> 01:48:37,860
So, uh, what is it, like,
Will has an attachment disorder?

1607
01:48:37,930 --> 01:48:40,230
Is it all that stuff?

1608
01:48:40,330 --> 01:48:43,230
Fear of abandonment?

1609
01:48:43,300 --> 01:48:46,300
Is that why I broke up
with Skylar?

1610
01:48:46,400 --> 01:48:49,700
- I didn't know you had.
- Yeah, I did.

1611
01:48:49,800 --> 01:48:53,740
- You wanna talk about it?
- No.

1612
01:48:55,940 --> 01:49:01,780
Hey, Will,
I don't know a lot.

1613
01:49:01,880 --> 01:49:05,320
You see this?
All this shit?

1614
01:49:10,290 --> 01:49:12,360
It's not your fault.

1615
01:49:14,700 --> 01:49:16,830
Yeah, I know that.

1616
01:49:16,930 --> 01:49:19,900
Look at me, son.

1617
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:23,470
- It's not your fault.
- I know.

1618
01:49:23,570 --> 01:49:28,170
No. It's not
your fault.

1619
01:49:28,270 --> 01:49:30,210
I know.

1620
01:49:30,280 --> 01:49:34,780
No, no, you don't.
It's not your fault.

1621
01:49:34,880 --> 01:49:36,850
- Hmm?
- I know.

1622
01:49:36,920 --> 01:49:39,620
- It's not your fault.
- All right.

1623
01:49:39,720 --> 01:49:42,150
It's not your fault.

1624
01:49:44,060 --> 01:49:49,290
- It's not your fault.
- Don't fuck with me.

1625
01:49:49,390 --> 01:49:51,730
It's not your fault.

1626
01:49:51,830 --> 01:49:55,370
Don't fuck with me, all right?
Don't fuck with me, Sean, not you.

1627
01:49:55,470 --> 01:49:58,000
It's not your fault.

1628
01:50:03,240 --> 01:50:07,310
It's not your fault.

1629
01:50:13,550 --> 01:50:16,620
My God...

1630
01:50:16,720 --> 01:50:21,330
My God! I'm so sorry!
My God!

1631
01:50:35,570 --> 01:50:37,640
Fuck them, okay?

1632
01:52:03,760 --> 01:52:07,860
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I'm Will Hunting. I'm here about a position.

1633
01:52:07,930 --> 01:52:10,330
Could you just have
a seat for a moment?

1634
01:52:13,930 --> 01:52:17,300
Yes, there's
a Mr. Hunting in the lobby.

1635
01:52:37,320 --> 01:52:39,420
Which one did you take?

1636
01:52:39,490 --> 01:52:44,430
I was over at McNeil. It's one of
the jobs the professor set me up with.

1637
01:52:44,500 --> 01:52:48,870
I haven't told him yet, but I went
down there and talked to my boss...

1638
01:52:48,930 --> 01:52:52,370
My new boss.
He seemed like a good guy.

1639
01:52:52,440 --> 01:52:57,840
- Is that what you want?
- Yeah, you know, I think so.

1640
01:52:57,910 --> 01:53:00,950
Well, good for you.
Congratulations.

1641
01:53:01,010 --> 01:53:02,950
Thanks.

1642
01:53:06,020 --> 01:53:07,950
Time's up.

1643
01:53:10,890 --> 01:53:14,160
So that's- So that's it?
So we're done?

1644
01:53:14,220 --> 01:53:17,030
Yeah, that's it.

1645
01:53:17,090 --> 01:53:19,960
You're done.
You're a free man.

1646
01:53:21,230 --> 01:53:25,970
Well, um, I just want you
to know, Sean, that...

1647
01:53:26,040 --> 01:53:28,040
You're welcome, Will.

1648
01:53:33,180 --> 01:53:36,210
So, you know, I hope
we keep in touch, you know.

1649
01:53:36,280 --> 01:53:38,780
Yeah, me too.

1650
01:53:38,850 --> 01:53:41,480
I'll be travelin' around a bit.
It'll be a little hard, but, uh...

1651
01:53:41,550 --> 01:53:45,250
I've got an answering machine at
the college I'll be checking in with.

1652
01:53:45,320 --> 01:53:49,160
So, here's the number.

1653
01:53:49,220 --> 01:53:53,100
You call that.
I'll get back to you right away.

1654
01:53:53,160 --> 01:53:56,270
Yeah, you know,
I figured I'm just gonna...

1655
01:53:56,330 --> 01:54:00,900
put my money back on the table
and see what kind of cards I get.

1656
01:54:02,170 --> 01:54:05,170
You do what's in your heart,
son. You'll be fine.

1657
01:54:09,640 --> 01:54:11,850
- Thank you, Sean.
- Uh...

1658
01:54:11,910 --> 01:54:13,980
Thank you, Will.

1659
01:54:15,680 --> 01:54:18,990
Hey, does this violate
the patient-doctor relationship?

1660
01:54:19,050 --> 01:54:21,220
Naw. Only if you
grab my ass.

1661
01:54:24,990 --> 01:54:27,190
- Take care.
- You too.

1662
01:54:27,260 --> 01:54:29,200
Yeah.

1663
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,030
Hey.

1664
01:54:33,100 --> 01:54:35,470
Good luck, son.

1665
01:54:46,580 --> 01:54:49,380
Two beers.

1666
01:54:52,090 --> 01:54:54,120
What's up?
Did you guys go?

1667
01:54:54,190 --> 01:54:56,560
No. I had to talk him down.

1668
01:54:56,620 --> 01:55:00,330
- Why didn't you yoke him?
- Little Morgan's got a lot of scrap to him.

1669
01:55:00,390 --> 01:55:02,330
People try to whip
his ass every week.

1670
01:55:02,400 --> 01:55:04,860
- Fuckin' kid won't back down.
- What are you sayin' about me?

1671
01:55:04,930 --> 01:55:08,430
- Was I talkin' to you?
None of your fuckin' business.

1672
01:55:08,500 --> 01:55:11,770
- Go get me a beer.
- I ordered two beers!

1673
01:55:11,840 --> 01:55:13,840
- Hey, asshole.
- What, bitch?

1674
01:55:13,910 --> 01:55:17,740
- Happy birthday.
- Thought we forgot, huh, bitch?

1675
01:55:17,810 --> 01:55:20,410
- Come on!
- I'm goin'. I'm goin'.

1676
01:55:20,480 --> 01:55:22,410
All right. Who's first?

1677
01:55:22,480 --> 01:55:24,920
- Come on, motherfucker!
- Who's first?

1678
01:55:24,980 --> 01:55:26,920
# Oh, Danny boy #

1679
01:55:26,990 --> 01:55:30,520
Here's your present.

1680
01:55:30,590 --> 01:55:32,590
- Come on, bro.
- What?

1681
01:55:32,660 --> 01:55:36,930
Well, we knew you had to get back and
forth to Cambridge for your new job.

1682
01:55:36,990 --> 01:55:40,870
I knew I wasn't gonna fuckin'
drive you every day, so...

1683
01:55:40,930 --> 01:55:45,000
- Morgan wanted to get you a "T" pass.
- That's not what I was sayin'!

1684
01:55:45,070 --> 01:55:47,570
But, uh, you're 21 now.

1685
01:55:47,640 --> 01:55:51,210
You're legally allowed to drink, so we
figured the best thing for ya was a car.

1686
01:55:51,280 --> 01:55:53,740
- How do you like it?
- This is like...

1687
01:55:56,210 --> 01:56:00,150
It's the ugliest fuckin' car
I've ever seen in my life.

1688
01:56:00,220 --> 01:56:02,250
- Come on, brother.
- How'd you guys do this?

1689
01:56:02,320 --> 01:56:07,260
You know, me and Bill
scraped together the parts,

1690
01:56:07,320 --> 01:56:09,390
and Morgan was out panhandlin'
for change every day.

1691
01:56:09,460 --> 01:56:11,390
I had the router to do
all the bodywork.

1692
01:56:11,460 --> 01:56:13,400
Yeah, I have a fuckin' job,
too, brother.

1693
01:56:13,460 --> 01:56:15,900
Guy's been up my ass for two years about
a job. I had to let him help with the car.

1694
01:56:15,970 --> 01:56:18,030
So you finally got a job,
huh, Morgan?

1695
01:56:18,100 --> 01:56:20,340
- Yeah, had one. Now I'm fucked again.
- So what is it?

1696
01:56:20,400 --> 01:56:24,070
- A lawn mower? What do ya got?
- It's a straight fuckin' six.

1697
01:56:24,140 --> 01:56:26,080
Me and Bill rebuilt
this engine ourselves here.

1698
01:56:26,140 --> 01:56:29,210
It's a good car.
The engine's good. Engine's good.

1699
01:56:29,280 --> 01:56:32,680
- Happy 21, Will.
- Happy 21, brother.

1700
01:56:39,760 --> 01:56:41,690
Hi.

1701
01:56:43,160 --> 01:56:45,190
Come on in.

1702
01:56:47,300 --> 01:56:49,260
Sean, I, um...

1703
01:56:49,330 --> 01:56:52,370
Me too, Gerry.

1704
01:56:52,430 --> 01:56:54,800
Yeah. Good.

1705
01:56:55,870 --> 01:56:58,010
I heard you're
takin' some time.

1706
01:56:58,070 --> 01:57:02,680
Yeah. Travel a little bit,
maybe write.

1707
01:57:02,740 --> 01:57:04,710
So where are you going?

1708
01:57:04,780 --> 01:57:08,780
India and China
and Baltimore.

1709
01:57:10,050 --> 01:57:12,120
Oh.

1710
01:57:12,190 --> 01:57:14,190
You know when
you'll be back?

1711
01:57:14,260 --> 01:57:17,660
Oh. I got this flyer
the other day.

1712
01:57:17,730 --> 01:57:20,560
It says, uh, class of '72
is having a reunion in six months.

1713
01:57:20,630 --> 01:57:22,560
Yeah, I got
one of those too.

1714
01:57:22,630 --> 01:57:24,560
Why don't you come?
I'll buy ya a drink.

1715
01:57:24,630 --> 01:57:27,500
The drinks at
those things are free.

1716
01:57:27,570 --> 01:57:31,070
I know, Gerry.
I was being ironical.

1717
01:57:35,440 --> 01:57:39,250
- Oh.
- How about a drink right now?

1718
01:57:39,310 --> 01:57:42,480
Yeah. It's a good idea.

1719
01:57:42,550 --> 01:57:44,920
Come on.
This one's on me.

1720
01:57:47,690 --> 01:57:50,060
- I got the winner right here, pal.
- Oh!

1721
01:57:50,120 --> 01:57:53,460
Yes, sir, this is the one.

1722
01:57:53,530 --> 01:57:55,860
This is my ticket
to paradise.

1723
01:57:55,930 --> 01:57:58,000
Do you know what the odds
are against winning the lottery?

1724
01:57:58,060 --> 01:58:01,100
- What? Four to one?
- About 30 million to one.

1725
01:58:01,170 --> 01:58:03,300
I still have a shot, you know?

1726
01:58:03,370 --> 01:58:09,240
Yes, just about as big chance as you being hit
by lightning here on the staircase right now.

1727
01:58:09,310 --> 01:58:12,580
It's a possibility too. I mean,
32 million. If you look at the size...

1728
01:59:42,030 --> 01:59:44,430
Will!

1729
02:00:03,450 --> 02:00:05,390
Will?

1730
02:01:12,620 --> 02:01:14,550
He's not there.

1731
02:01:31,600 --> 02:01:35,570
# I'll fake it
through the day #

1732
02:01:35,640 --> 02:01:38,910
Sean, if
the professor calls about that job,

1733
02:01:38,980 --> 02:01:43,550
just tell him sorry,
I had to go see about a girl.

1734
02:01:43,610 --> 02:01:45,550
Will.

1735
02:01:47,150 --> 02:01:50,490
Son of a bitch.
He stole my line.

1736
02:01:53,720 --> 02:02:00,360
# To take its toll
and in having a lot #

1737
02:02:00,430 --> 02:02:04,270
# Of nothin' to do #

1738
02:02:04,330 --> 02:02:07,670
# Do you miss me #

1739
02:02:07,740 --> 02:02:11,410
# Miss misery #

1740
02:02:11,470 --> 02:02:15,210
# Like you say you do #

1741
02:02:17,110 --> 02:02:21,380
# I know you'd rather
see me gone #

1742
02:02:21,450 --> 02:02:24,490
# Than to see me #

1743
02:02:24,550 --> 02:02:26,920
# The way #

1744
02:02:26,990 --> 02:02:30,060
# That I am, when I am #

1745
02:02:30,120 --> 02:02:33,630
# In the life anyway #

1746
02:02:33,690 --> 02:02:40,730
# Next door TV's
flashing through #

1747
02:02:40,800 --> 02:02:44,440
# Frames on the wall #

1748
02:02:44,510 --> 02:02:47,540
# It's a comedy #

1749
02:02:47,610 --> 02:02:50,180
# Of errors, you see #

1750
02:02:50,240 --> 02:02:55,220
# It's about
takin' a fall #

1751
02:02:57,350 --> 02:03:00,450
# To vanish into #

1752
02:03:00,520 --> 02:03:03,690
# Oblivion #

1753
02:03:03,760 --> 02:03:07,530
# It's easy to do #

1754
02:03:07,590 --> 02:03:10,430
# And I try to be #

1755
02:03:10,500 --> 02:03:14,630
# But you know me
I come back #

1756
02:03:14,700 --> 02:03:19,000
# When you want me to #

1757
02:03:19,070 --> 02:03:22,540
# Do you miss me #

1758
02:03:22,610 --> 02:03:26,280
# Miss misery #

1759
02:03:26,350 --> 02:03:31,620
# Like you say you do #
