現在我們回到48小時的
Itchy&Scratchy鑽石馬拉松級紀念
We now return to our 48-hour
Itchy & Scratchy diamond jubilee marathon-
慶祝75周年的呵痒搞笑的殘忍暴力和
celebrating 75 years
of rib-tickling brutality...
熱鬧的暴力
and hilarious atrocities.
Itchy&Scratchy
The Itchy & Scratchy Show
回憶血雨腥風   Scratchy去世!和平歸來
Aw.
如果我要不再喜愛暴力 你要殺了我
當然
- If I ever stop loving violence, I want you to shoot me.
- Will do.
今晚 一頭逃脫的熊
威脅到宇航員的生命
Tonight: A stowaway bear
is terrorizing space shuttle astronauts.
但是 第一個高潮是
明天的Itchy&Scratchy游行
But first a sneak peak
at tomorrow's Itchy and Scratchy parade.
大家好 我在主干道上現場直播
Hello, everybody.
I'm here live on Main Street...
熱情的影迷在為盛大的游行慶祝
而占最好的座位
where dedicated fans are already staking out
the best seats for the big anniversary parade.
再見 媽
再見 爸
Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad.
再見孩子們 順路帶六扎啤酒回來
Bye, kids. On your way back
pick up a six-pack ofbeer.
Bart Lisa 現在都晚上11點了
你們要去哪儿?
Bart, Lisa, it's 11:00 at night.
Where do you think you're going?
市區 我們要占個位子
看Itchy&Scratchy游行
- Downtown.
- We gotta get seats for the Itchy and Scratchy parade.
我可不想我們孩子們整晚獨自站在
寒冷的危險的路上
I won't have my children sitting alone
on a cold, dangerous street all night.
Homer 你也去
哦 為什么他們不能帶槍去?
- Homer, you go too.
- Oh! Why can't they just take the gun?
嘿 漫畫書店還開著門
Hey, the comic book store's still open.
看著我們的位子
我知道
- Save our seats.
- Will do.
哈嘍
哦!
- Hello.
- Oh!
嘿 小姐 給個机會
我和你在一起
Hey, sister, just give me a chance
to get next to you.
嘿嘿嘿!
Hey-y-y!
嘿 我先來的 寶貝
Hey, my threads, baby.
我之前怎么會沒有看過
那個Itchy&Scratchy?
How come I've never seen
that Itchy & Scratchy before?
也許你們真是在青春期前的無知期里
Perhaps because you are
a prepubescent ignoramus.
這集是私人錄制的Itchy & Scratchy
This is a bootleg copy
of Itchy & Scratchy Meet Fritz the Cat.
因為它忠實的描述了性和麻醉藥的消費
Because of its frank depiction
of sex and narcotic consumption...
這不是你們這种嬰儿期的智力可以理解的
it is not for infantile intellects
such as yours.
現在 走開
Now toodle-oo.
酷 我給你10塊錢買下它
Cool.
I'll give you 10 bucks for that.
你是Hi和Lois的創始人?
因為你讓我發笑
Are you the creator of Hi and Lois?
Because you are making me laugh.
這張畫就要值750美元
That drawing is worth
exactly $750 American.
很有价值 啊?
你討价還价本事很高
- It's valuable, huh?
- Ooh, your powers of deduction are exceptional.
我基本不能讓你
在這里浪費它們
I simply can't allow you
to waste them here...
每時每刻都有
如此多的罪惡無法解決
when there are so many crimes
going unsolved at this very moment.
- 走走 為了美好的城市
- 白痴
- Go! Go, for the good of the city.
- Loser.
呃 倒霉!
Oh, nerts!
哪只是Itchy 這輛車是嗎?
是老鼠
- Which one's Itchy- the car?
- The mouse.
哦 我猜那現在不是它
Oh. I guess that's not him then.
這個气球是代表老Roger Myers 
Represented on this next float
is Roger Myers Sr...
他在1921年建立了他的公司
who founded his company in 1921...
當他合作創造出一只叫Itchy的老鼠
和一只叫Scratchy的貓時把它發展壯大 
and struck it big when he teamed up a mouse
named Itchy with a cat named Scratchy.
我們現在看見的是
他創造出的兩個滑稽的角色
Here we see him creating
the two comical characters...
像從他頭里冒出來
out of thoughts
he plucks from his head.
那個在气球前揮手的人
And that man waving
from the front of the float...
是他的儿子 小Roger Myers
is his son, Roger Myers Jr.
難道他不是你遇見過的最有趣的人? Dave?
Oh, isn't this just the most fun
you've ever had in your life, Dave?
是的 Suzanne 确實
Yes, Suzanne. It is.
哇!哇!
Whoa! Whoa!
哦 算了吧
我到其他地方去
Oh, forget this.
I'm outta here.
呀 Bart! 呀~
Yea, Bart.! Yea.!
游行隊伍已經進入Bumtown(貧民區)!
And now the parade has entered Bumtown.!
這是多么令人激動 Dave!
Oh, it's all just so exciting, Dave.!
當然游行線路看上去有點失策
- Certainly seems to be
a poorly planned parade route.
哦
Uh-oh.
嘿 等等
Hey, wait up!
滾出Bumtown
一群沒有智商的廢物
Get outta Bumtown,
ya no-talent bum!
有點尊敬 行吧
那個﹛沒有智商的廢物﹛創造出了Itchy&Scratchy
Show some respect, man.
That "no-talent" created Itchy and Scratchy.
他沒有創造出Itchy 是我
He didn't create Itchy. I did.
嗯?
他在1928年偷走了我的角色
- Huh?
- He stole the character from me in 1928.
當我抱怨的時候  他的爪牙把我從辦公室踢出來
扔了塊鐵板給我
When I complained, his thugs kicked me out
of his office and dropped an anvil on me.
幸運的是那時候我帶了把雨傘
Luckily I was carrying an umbrella
at the time.
你創造了Itchy
Itchy&Scratchy里的Itchy?
You invented Itchy-
the Itchy & Scratchy Itchy?
當然 事實上
我創立了整個卡通暴力的概念
Sure. In fact, I invented the whole concept
of cartoon violence.
在我出山前 所有卡通動物都只彈奏夏威夷四弦琴
我改變了它們的全部
Before I came along, all cartoon animals did
was play the ukulele. I changed all that.
好吧 我沒有說你是說謊 但是
Well, I'm not callin' you a liar, but-
但是我沒法找出合适的方法
來結束這些話
but I can't think of a way
to finish that sentence.
所以我是個騙子 對嗎?
So I'm a liar, am I?
Itchy 幸運的老鼠
在Manhattan的瘋狂行為
"Itchy the Lucky Mouse
in Manhattan Madness. "
這是第一部Itchy動畫
而且是我Chester J. Lampwick做的
That's the first Itchy cartoon ever made.
And it was made by me, ChesterJ. Lampwick.
找一個90年的老式電影机
我就証明給你看
Find me a 90-year-old projector
and I'll prove it to you.
Itchy和愛爾蘭人的糾纏
"Itchy runs afoul of an Irishman. "
小心 Itchy!
他是愛爾蘭人!
Look out, Itchy.! He's Irish.!
來吧 Itchy 殺了他
殺了那個家伙
Come on, Itchy. Kill him.! Kill that guy.!
更多坏的机會
"A chance for more mis"-
看那個胖白痴
Look at that fat oaf.
噓! 那是Teddy Roosevelt
Shh.! That's Teddy Roosevelt.
(啊 曼哈頓城 
它是像我一樣的老紐約們心中的最好的標志)
導演  創作 
CHESTER J LAMPWICK
All right, Chester.! Woo.!
好樣的!
Way to go.!
我真不敢相信 那确确實實是Itchy!
你真是創造了他們
I can't believe it. That was Itchy all right.
You did invent him.
當人們看到這些時
你會變得富有和出名的
When people see this, you'll be rich and famous.
D'oh.
這曾是部我作的精彩的電影
最后一次我試圖給一個四歲的孩子留下記憶
That was a nice film I had once.
Last time I try to impress a four-year-old.
好吧 再見 孩子
Well, see ya, kid.
你不能這樣回貧民區
你創造了Itchy 你應該是個百万富翁
You can't just go back to the gutter.
You created Itchy. You should be a millionaire.
在20年時Roger Myers沒給我一分錢
Ah, Roger Myers wouldn't
give me a cent in the '20s.
他為何現在給我什么東西?
Why would he give me anything now?
你問的是老Roger Myers要的錢
小Roger Myers現在負責工作室了
You asked Roger Myers Sr. for money.
Roger Myers Jr. 's in charge of the studio now.
他是個好人
每年圣誕節 
He's a good man.
Every Christmas he goes down to the pound...
救一只貓和一只老鼠
把他們給飢餓的家庭
and rescues one cat and one mouse
and gives them to a hungry family.
嗯 工作室星期二才關門
動畫師星期一聚餐
Hmm, studio's closed until Tuesday.
Animators have A.A. on Monday.
嗯 你可以留在我家
直到那時
Hmm. Well, you can stay
at my house until then.
我父母不會介意的
因為他們根本不會知道的
My parents won't mind
because they won't even know about it.
好的
樓梯很安全
All right.
The coast is clear.
- 這有個箱子你可以睡在里面
- 謝謝
- There's a box you can sleep in.
- Thanks.
- 只要把那個小床移出來
- 好的
- Just move that cot outta the way.
- Okay.
- 你知道氡是什么?
- 不
- Do you know what radon is?
- No.
晚安
Good night.
有零錢嗎?
Spare change?
媽 有奇怪的味道和罵聲
Mom, there's a weird smell
and a lot of cursing...
從地下室傳出來
而爸爸在樓上
coming from the basement,
and Dad's upstairs.
哦 是Bart和神秘的陌生人
Oh, it's just Bart and a mysterious stranger.
他不是普通的流浪的人 媽
他是天才的流浪漢
He's not a regular bum, Mom.
He's a genius bum.
他創造了Itchy
他是卡通暴力之父
He created Itchy,
and he's the father of cartoon violence.
他只需要留在這儿到明天
He just needs to stay here till tomorrow.
我們准備去Ithcy&Scratchy工作室
We're goin' down to Itchy & Scratchy Studios
to pick up his check.
We're goin' down to Itchy & Scratchy Studios
to pick up his check.
取他的支票
好吧 只能待一夜
Well, if it's just for one more night.
那么 我們回顧一下
So, let's review:
你們兩個怪人散步進來
新鮮的就像下水道的味道
You two screwballs have just strolled in here
fresh from the sewer...
給我那該死的那個丁克
毫無証据地生了Itchy 
and given me a bunch of bulldink
about creating Itchy-with no proof at all-
你們希望我給你們...多少?
and you expect me to give you...
how much?
8万億美金
$800 billion.
好吧 真是讓人回想起很多
Well, that brought back
a lot of memories.
好吧 先生們
我接受你們的案子
All right, gentlemen,
I'll take your case.
但是 我要你們給我1000塊定金
But I'm going to have to ask for
a thousand-dollar retainer.
1000塊?
但是你說 不要錢
A thousand dollars?
But your ad says, "No money down. "
哦 他們得這樣組織
Oh, they got this all screwed up.
那么你不能偶然事實通融一下?
So you don't work
on a contingency basis?
不 先要錢
No, money down!
Oops.
我也不應該有這行協會標志
I shouldn't have
this Bar Association logo here either.
嘿 爸 能給我1000塊錢嗎?
好吧 等會儿 做什么?
- Hey, Dad, can I have a thousand dollars?
- All right. Wait. For what?
- 為了給流浪者請律師
- 算了吧
- To pay for a lawyer for my bum.
- Forget it.
我認出你了!
I thought I recognized you.
在1947年 我給你一盤玉米松餅
要你畫雞籠
I gave you a plate of corn muffins
back in 1947 to paint my chicken coop.
而你從來沒做過!
那些松餅真惡心
- And you never did it!
- Those corn muffins were lousy.
- 畫我的雞籠
- 試試看!?
- Paint my chicken coop!
- Make me!
- 夠了 一個人得走
- 好吧 爺爺走吧
- That does it. One of them has to go.
- Okay. Grandpa.
不 流浪的
- No, the B-U-M.
- Oh.
等等 等等 
有一個簡單的方法除掉Chester
Wait. There's an easy way to get rid of Chester...
而不內疚地送他回貧民窟
without the guilt
of sending him back to the gutter.
而且所有這些
只要你們花1000美元
And all it will cost you
is a thousand dollars.

你也注意到 Myers先生的名字和版權通知
You will also notice Mr. Myers's name
and copyright notice...
在最初的畫片里Itchy&Scratchy動畫家族
其他成員
on the original drawings of the other members
of the Itchy and Scratchy family:
棕鼻胸
怒气羊
Brown-Nose Bear,
Disgruntled Goat...
脹气狐狸
富骷髏叔叔
Flatulent Fox,
Rich Uncle Skeleton...
貪吃狗
and Dinner Dog.
我的委托人的電影早于所有這些
尊敬的法官大人
My client's film predates
all of those things, Your Honor.
哦 對! 我差點忘了
Oh, yes! I've forgotten...
你著名的電影
your famous film-
那部在開庭前被損坏
而且沒有另外備份的
the one you destroyed before the trial
and haven't been able to find another copy of.
哦 對 就是那部電影
Oh, yes. That film.
是
你沒有備份 是嗎?
Yes.
You don't have a copy, do you?
Krusty 你之前見過這個所謂的動畫天才嗎?
Krusty, have you ever seen
this so-called animation genius before?
- 是的 我見過
- 你見過?
- Yes, I have.
- You have?
我給他一雙薄餅卷
叫他給我畫篱笆
I gave him a couple of blintzes
to paint my fence...
但是他從來沒做過!
那些薄餅卷太難吃了
- but he never did it!
- Those blintzes were terrible.
- 給我畫篱笆
- 試試看!?
- Paint my fence!
- Make me.
你還我那些薄餅卷
You give me back those blintzes then!
肅靜 肅靜
我們不關心你的薄餅卷
Order! Order!
We don't care about your blintzes.
現在 Lampwick先生
當Roger Myers偷了你的創意
Now, Mr. Lampwick,
when Roger Myers stole your character-
- 反對
- 有效
- Objection.
- Sustained.
如果我今天再次听到 反對 和 有效
If I hear "objection" and "sustained"...
我想我就會發瘋的
one more time today,
I think I'm going to scream.
- 反對
- 有效
- Objection.
- Sustained.
Roger Myers沒有創造任何屬于他的角色
Roger Myers didn't create any of his characters.
- 他都是偷來的
- 偷來的? 
- He stole them all.
- Stole them all? That could turn this whole case around.
Myers只創造了一個角色 
The only characters Myers could ever
come up with were pathetic stick figures...
以"諷刺馬"和"瘋狂的郵遞員" 命名
with the words "Sarcastic Horse"
and "Manic Mailman" printed on 'em.
而他們根本就是狗屎! 所以他就開始偷竊別人的創作
And they stank! So he started stealing
other people's characters.
這是個謊言
你是 發過誓 Myers先生?
- That's a lie!
- Are you saying- under oath, Mr. Myers-
你父親從未偷過其他
与你工作室有關的角色?
that your father didn't steal any of the characters
associated with your studio?
好吧 我不認為我發過誓
但是 是的 我父親創造了他們
Well, I don't think I am under oath,
but yes, my father created them all.
除了脹气狐狸
那是基于一個真實的故事
Except for Flatulent Fox.
That was based on a true story.
可是他确實創造了Itchy
那件事我确信不疑
But he did create Itchy.
That's one thing I am sure of.
Hutz先生 我們已經在這里耗了4個小時了
你還有其他証据嗎?
Mr. Hutz, we've been in here for four hours.
Do you have any evidence at all?
好吧 法官大人
我們有很多傳聞和猜測
Well, Your Honor,
we've got plenty of hearsay and conjecture.
這些 也是証据
Those are... kinds of evidence.
法官大人
我申請休庭
Your Honor,
I move for dismissal.
我有主意了
爸 給我750塊
I've got it!
Dad, give me $750.
好的
Okay.
繼續開庭
我就回來
Keep the trial going.
I'll be right back.
法官大人
我要再次傳訊我所有令人惊奇的目擊証人
Your Honor, I'd like to call
all of my surprise witnesses again.
哦 那是他們
Oh, there they are.
哦 我最喜歡他們了
Oh, they were my favorites.
謝謝
Thank you.
我知道我曾經在其他地方
看過這些片斷
I knew I had seen this exact scene
somewhere else.
這是Lampwick先生給我看的電影
It was in the movie
Mr. Lampwick showed me.
女士們 先生們
這張圖畫是1919年畫的
Ladies and gentlemen,
this drawing was made in 1919-
在Roger Myers制作第一部
Itchy&Scratchy動畫9年前
nine years before Roger Myers
made his first Itchy and Scratchy cartoon.
那可能是任何人任何時間畫的
法官大人 沒有簽名和日期
That could have been drawn by anyone at anytime,
Your Honor. There's no signature or date.
看看底下的邊框 釘子
Look under the frame, Brad.
小心 小心
Careful. Careful. Whoops.
在這里
It's there!
嗯 致Roger Myers 繼續畫畫
Hmm.
"To Roger Myers. Keep drawing.
"你創作的勇气和你的天分一樣令人欣喜"
"Your moxie more than makes up
for your lack of talent.
"你的伙伴 ChesterJ. Lampwick
1919年9月3日"
Your pal, ChesterJ. Lampwick.
September 3, 1919."
好吧
也許我父親确實偷了Itchy
Okay.
Maybe my dad did steal Itchy.
但是 又如何呢?
動畫本來就建立在剽竊上
But so what?
Animation is built on plagiarism.
如果沒人剽竊"蜜月期"這部電影
If it weren't for someone plagiarizing
The Honeymooners...
我們沒有"打火石"了
we wouldn't have The Flintstones.
如果沒人撕毀了"Bilko軍官" 
那也就不會有Top Cat了
If someone hadn't ripped off Sergeant Bilko,
there'd be no Top Cat.
橘子犬? Wiggum警長?
瑜伽熊? 啊!
Huckleberry Hound? Chief Wiggum?
Yogi Bear? Ha!
Andy Griffith. Edward G. Robinson!
Art Carney! 都是這樣!
Andy Griffith. Edward G. Robinson.
Art Carney.
法官大人 你要我們不能抄襲想法
Your Honor, you take away
our right to steal ideas...
我們從哪里來靈感? 她嗎?
where are they gonna come from- her?
Uh- hmm-
"笨鬼"怎么樣?
How 'bout... Ghost Mutt?
法庭判決 根据Lampwick先生要求
The court rules in favor of Mr. Lampwick.
Itchy&Scratchy卡通工作室
要償還8000億美金
Itchy & Scratchy Studios
will pay a restitution of $800 billion.
雖然那個總數可能會上訴
Though that amount will probably
come down a bit on appeal.
我希望你開心 孩子
工作室倒閉了
I hope you're happy, kid.
The studio's bankrupt.
你毀了Itchy&Scratchy
You just killed Itchy and Scratchy.
我們毀了Itchy&Scratchy?
We killed Itchy and Scratchy?
終于擺平了
想去慶祝一下?
Good riddance.
Wanna go celebrate?
我想吃肝臟和洋蔥
I feel like liver and onions.
Mmm.
你想怎么用你的錢? Lampwick先生
What are you gonna do with all your money,
Mr. Lampwick?
好 首先 這是你雇律師的1000塊錢
給你
Well, first off, here's your thousand dollars
back for hiring that lawyer...
750塊 那幅畫
and $750 for the drawing...
這是雙份的錢
補償給你帶來的麻煩
and here's a couple of bucks
for your trouble.
噢!
瞧瞧 Marge 雙份的錢!
Whoo-hoo!
Look, Marge. A couple of bucks!
剩下的 我想實現
這些年
As for the rest of it, I'm gonna buy
the one thing I've been dreaming of...
我在貧民窟里做得夢
all the years I spent in the gutter:
一座金房子
a solid gold house.
好吧 Itchy&Scratchy沒有了
但是這里還有趣的卡通
Well, Itchy and Scratchy are gone, but here's
a cartoon that tries to make learning fun!
Heh-heh-ho-ho-
對不起 孩子們
Sorry about this, kids.
But stay tuned.
我們真的有好商業娛樂片
我發誓
We got some real good toy commercials
comin' right up. I swear.
嘿 誰在國會樓梯上留下這么多垃圾
- Hey, who left all this garbage
on the steps of Congress?
我不是垃圾
I'm not garbage.
* 我是個修正案
是的 我是個修正案 *
I'm an amendment to be
Yes, an amendment to be
* 我希望他們會批准我 *
And I'm hopin' that they'll ratify me
* 有很多燒國旗者 *
There's a lot offlag burners
* 他們得到太多的自由 *
Who have got too much freedom
* 我希望讓警察打他們變得合法 *
I wanna make it legal
for policemen to beat 'em
* 因為我們自由有限制 *
'Cause there's limits to our liberties
* 至少 我希望和祈禱他們是 *
Least I hope and pray that there are
* 因為這些自由太异想天開 *
'Cause those liberal freaks go too far
可是我們為什么不能立法
使燒國旗違法? 
But why can't we just make a law
against flag burning?
因為那個法律會違憲 
Because that law would be unconstitutional.
可是一旦我們修改憲法 
But if we change the Constitution-
那么我們就可以制定各种瘋狂的法律
Then we could make all sorts of crazy laws.!
- 現在你終于明白了
- 這是什么東西?
- Now you're catching on.
- What the hell is this?
這是70年代的一個諷刺抗議者的白痴動畫
It's one of those campy, '70s throwbacks
that appeals to Generation X'ers.
我們需要另一個越南
We need another Vietnam
to thin out their ranks a little.
如果人們說你會在憲法里不夠好怎么辦
What if people say you're not good enough
to be in the Constitution?
* 那我會排除异己 *
Then I'll crush all opposition to me
* 我會要Ted Kennedy歸還 *
And I'll make Ted Kennedy pay
* 如果他胜利歸來
我就說他是同性戀 *
If he fights back
I'll say that he's gay
好消息 修正案
他們修改了
Good news, Amendment.
They ratified ya.
你已經在美國憲法里了
You're in the U.S. Constitution.
哦 耶! 門開了 孩子
Oh, yeah! Door's open, boys.
Whoob-whoob-whoob-whoob.
這是真的 某些卡通确實鼓吹暴力
So it's true. Some cartoons
do encourage violence.
- Ow! We gotta get Itchy and Scratchy back.
- And soon!
- 啊噢! 我們要讓Itchy&Scratchy回來
- 要快!
 
嗷!
Ow!
我們要做更多的Itchy&Scratchy 動畫
You've got to make more
Itchy and Scratchy cartoons.
法官說 只要你能支付Lampwick的版稅
就沒問題
The judge says it's okay
as long as you pay Mr. Lampwick royalties.
版稅? 哈!
Royalties? Ha!
我們沒有錢制作卡通了
我失去了一切
I don't have the money to produce the cartoons.
I lost everything.
我甚至不能讓我爸的頭
保存在Freakin冷凍中心了
I can't even keep my dad's head
in the freakin' cryogenic center anymore.
你在里面不舒服?爸爸?
Ya comfortable in there, Daddy?
如果錢只是唯一的問題
我知道有個人有很多
Look, if money's the only problem,
I know a guy who has lots of it.
要擦鞋嗎 先生?
為你梳頭?先生?
Shoe shine, sir?
Comb your hair for ya? Sir?
- 哼
- 先生?先生?先生?
- Humph.
- Sir? Sir? Sir?
好吧 等你回來
Okay.
Catch you on the way back.
- 哦 嗨 孩子們
- 嗨 Chester
- Oh, hi, kids.
- Hi, Chester.
你可以為制作Itchy&Scratchy動畫
付更多的錢嗎?
Listen. Would you pay to make
more Itchy and Scratchy cartoons?
你可以得到更多的版稅
我不再需要錢了
- You'll get more royalties.
- I don't need any more money.
我不貪婪
只要我保持健康和億万家產
I'm not greedy. As long as I've got
my health and my millions of dollars...
我的金房子
和我的火箭車
and my gold house
and my rocket car...
- 我不再需要別的什么了
- 是的 但是...
- I don't need anything else.
- Yes, but-
沒興趣
Not interested.
爸爸 我們有183000塊嗎?
Dad, can we have
$183,000?
- 做什么?
- Lisa和我想投資動畫片
- What for?
- Lisa and I want to finance a series of animated cartoons.
哦 嗯 算了吧!
Oh. Uh- Forget it!
哦 不 我放棄了
Oh, no. I give up.
- 我們什么都做不了
- 是的 我同意
- There's nothin' we can do.
- Yeah. I agree.
- 你要把Apu從監獄弄出來?
- 好吧
- You wanna start on tryin' to get Apu out of jail?
- Okay.
等等 你們不能就這樣放棄Itchy&Scratchy
你們對這些事情總是很在行
Wait, kids. You can't give up on Itchy and Scratchy.
You're always so good at these things.
想想你是怎么讓Krusty和他的父親和好
