This isn't because
you were wounded, is it?
傷?
Wounded?
因爲, 我是說...
Because, I mean...
...你現在坐辦公桌.
...you're behind a desk now.
沒太多機會受傷.
Not much chance
of getting wounded there.
看,隊長, 這與那個無關.
Look, captain, it has nothing
to do with that.
我要作演說了.
I'll make my speech.
他們讓我做這個,
你明白.
They make me do this,
you understand.
我憎恨失去一個好警察.
I hate to lose a good cop.
改變主意還不晚.
Not too late to change your mind.
很多好警察想善始善終.
Lot of good cops want to drop
the whole kit and caboodle.
誰不是?
And who wouldn't?
薪水發臭...
The pay stinks...
...一天十六小時把耳朵伸進人渣.
...and you're up to your ears
in human scum 1 6 hours a day.
但它深入了你的血液.
But it gets in your blood.
很多好警察要到這一步...
A lot of good cops'll
get to the point...
...要把警察徽章放到這張桌子...
...of slapping their badge
down on this desk...
...卻發現他們不能這麽做.
你呢?
...and find they just can't do it.
How about you?
是否歸隊?
Will you stick with the team?
不, 隊長.
我想我不會.
No, captain.
I don't think I will.
就像我說的, 他們讓我問的.
你明白.
Like I say, they make me ask.
You understand.
孩子怎麽樣?
How are the kids?
我沒有.
I don't have any.
到底怎麽了?
What the hell?
我得質問那些文職s.
I'd like to take my stick
to some of these clerks.
-文件說--
-我們失去了一個孩子.
-The file says--
-We lost a child.
失去它?
Lost it?
她. 失去她.
Her. Lost her.
是, 當然. 她.
太粗略了.
Yes, of course. Her.
That's rough.
嗯, 可能是.
Well, it can be.
是,先生.
Yes, sir.
還結著婚, 對吧?
Still married, right?
是的,先生, 是的.
Yes, sir, I am.

Just follow your tootsies.
你確定不要點什麽?
咖啡, 蘇打, 別的?
You sure you don't want something?
Coffee, soda, something?
不, 謝謝.
No, thank you.
我覺得這有點愚蠢.
I feel kind of stupid about this.
安全比抱歉好.
Better safe than sorry.
我也是這麽想的.
That's what I thought.
你對你丈夫有個詰制規定?
You have a restraining order
against your husband?
前夫.
Ex-husband.
他會在不該出現的日子出現...
He'd show up on the wrong day...
...或者午夜,
撞門.
...or in the middle of the night,
pounding on the door.
他脾氣暴躁.
He has this horrendous temper.
我不知道詰制規定是不是個好主意...
I didn't know if
a restraining order was a good idea...
...是否會更糟.
...if it'd do more harm than good.
但使法官說我們該懲罰他.
But the judge said
we should make an example of him.
他不能接近我們100英尺.
So he can't come within
1 00 feet of us.
還是碼?
是哪個?英尺還是碼?
Or is it yards?
Which is it? Feet or yards?
那得問法官.
That's up to the judge.
-我覺得是一樣的.
-那是他謹慎決定的.
-I thought it was a set thing.
-It's at his discretion.
那很有趣.
That's interesting.
他喝酒嗎?
Does he drink?
哦, 我還以爲在說法官!
Oh, I thought you meant the judge!
