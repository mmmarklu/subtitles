1
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:57,330
I had the craziest dream last night.

2
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:01,680
I was dancing the White Swan.

3
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,650
It was different choreography, though. It was more like the Bolshoi's.

4
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,290
It was the prologue,

5
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,110
when Rothbart casts his spell.

6
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:27,530
Look how pink. So pretty...

7
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:30,330
Pretty!

8
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:34,390
- You're in a good mood. - He promised to feature me more this season.

9
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:36,610
Well, he certainly should.

10
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,530
You've been there long enough,

11
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,420
and you're the most dedicated dancer in the company.

12
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,790
Up.

13
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,660
- What's that? - What?

14
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:50,850
There.

15
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:55,300
Nothing.

16
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,220
You're sure you don't want me to come with you?

17
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:05,410
You're a sweet girl.

18
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:20,670
Did you see Beth today?

19
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,940
I can't believe she's back.

20
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:26,330
- Of course she's back. - What, she can't take a hint?

21
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,560
The company is broke. No one comes to see her anymore.

22
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,250
Oh, nobody actually comes to see ballet full stop.

23
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:35,670
That's not true. I heard The Royal had one of their best seasons yet.

24
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,620
He just needs to try something new. That's all.

25
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:40,320
No, someone new.

26
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,490
- Like who? - Like someone who's not approaching menopause.

27
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:45,960
It's sad.

28
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,630
What's sad?

29
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,860
Beth's such a beautiful dancer.

30
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,430
Yeah, so is my grandmother.

31
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:59,970
- Well Fonteyn danced into her fifties. - Yeah, we know.

32
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:07,400
Great.

33
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,930
Thought I'd fucking missed my stop.

34
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,380
It's a hell-fit all the way from 79th.

35
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,680
Beautiful as always, Nina.

36
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,950
Relax.

37
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:15,570
And one, and two, and three, and four.

38
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,090
Stop, John. One second.

39
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:36,880
Okay, take position.

40
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:40,860
And one, and two, and three, and up.

41
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:44,320
And one, and two, and three, and four.

42
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:57,630
Hello, dear.

43
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,300
We all know the story.

44
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:10,050
Virginal girl, pure and sweet,

45
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,720
trapped in the body of a swan.

46
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:16,220
She desires freedom

47
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,200
that only true love can break the spell.

48
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:27,540
Her wish is nearly granted in the form of a Prince.

49
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:31,740
But before he can declare his love,

50
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:37,860
The lustful twin, the Black Swan, tricks and seduces him.

51
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:47,740
Devastated, the White Swan leaps off a cliff,

52
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:52,700
killing herself. And in death...

53
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,530
finds freedom.

54
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,110
- Good morning, company. - Good morning.

55
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,400
We will open our season with <i>Swan Lake</i>.

56
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,630
Done to death, I know.

57
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,230
But not like this.

58
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:17,130
We strip it down, make it visceral and real.

59
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:22,020
A new production needs a new Swan Queen.

60
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,770
A fresh face to present to the world.

61
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:33,000
But... Which of you can embody both Swans?

62
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,370
The White, and the Black.

63
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:45,390
All the soloists I tapped:

64
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,500
Go to your scheduled rehearsals this afternoon.

65
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:53,110
And the girls I didn't tap:

66
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,420
Meet me in the principals' studio at 5:00.

67
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,900
Thank you.

68
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,190
All right.

69
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,890
- Let's go. Did we do left side? - Yes, mistress.

70
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,010
Fuck! Fuck!

71
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:51,710
What?

72
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:35,420
If I was only casting the White Swan, she'd be yours.

73
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,440
But I'm not.

74
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,220
Maestro, Odile's coda, please.

75
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,990
Now show me your Black Swan, Nina.

76
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:09,620
Not so controlled. Seduce us.

77
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,930
Not just the Prince, but the court, the audience, the entire world.

78
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:16,120
Come on, like a spider spinning a web.

79
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:18,610
Attack it, attack it! Come on!

80
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:30,720
Well...

81
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,040
- Good of you to join us. - Sorry...

82
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,930
Girls, this is Lily.

83
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:38,530
Straight off the plane from San Francisco. She's filling Rebecca's old spot.

84
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:40,230
- Hey. - Get warmed up.

85
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,110
No, it's okay.

86
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,320
I'm good.

87
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:45,680
Should I go again?

88
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:48,600
No, thanks, Nina. I've seen enough.

89
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:54,200
Veronica, the White Swan variation.

90
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,090
Come on, come on, come on, please.

91
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,010
All right, Maestro.

92
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:04,750
Two, three...

93
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,000
So how'd it go?

94
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:16,000
You were late, so I called Susie in the office.

95
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:19,170
An audition! I can't believe he just sprang that on you.

96
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:21,380
So?

97
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,210
It was fine.

98
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,190
Just fine?

99
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,830
Oh, sweetheart...

100
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:32,660
You tell me about it.

101
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,110
Nina, everything all right?

102
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:29,150
I'm fine.

103
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:44,780
Almost done.

104
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:46,980
You're working yourself too hard.

105
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:52,590
- We all have off days. - That girl, um, barged in.

106
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,460
I'm sure she didn't mean to.

107
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:02,710
For a starter, if I hadn't taken you to each of your classes, you'd have been completely lost.

108
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:05,210
I'm going to talk to him tomorrow. I'm going to tell him I finished it.

109
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,680
You don't need to lie.

110
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:09,450
You won't convince him one way or the other.

111
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,330
Oh, sweetheart.

112
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,030
I know it's disappointing.

113
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:21,710
When you start getting older, there's all this

114
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,470
ridiculous pressure. God knows I understand.

115
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,590
But it's all right.

116
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,510
No matter what.

117
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,220
You'll probably get to dance the part of the cat again.

118
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,600
That's such a wonderful part.

119
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,350
Or maybe he'll make you a big swan.

120
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:46,310
Either way, you'll shine.

121
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:48,980
You know...

122
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,800
Everything will be better in the morning.

123
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:56,090
It always is.

124
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,500
Sweet girl.

125
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:27,460
Yes, Nina?

126
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,780
Do you have a minute?

127
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:34,780
- Now's not a good time. I get it. - Now is perfect.

128
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,710
So...

129
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,710
I just wanted to tell you that

130
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:46,630
I practiced the coda last night and

131
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:48,520
I finished.

132
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,840
I thought you should know.

133
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,690
Okay, Nina, listen. Honestly, I don't care about your technique.

134
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,670
- You should know that by now. - Yeah, but yesterday...

135
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:02,840
No. Anyway...

136
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,290
I've already chosen Veronica. Sorry.

137
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:08,060
Sorry.

138
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,140
Okay, thank you.

139
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,050
That's it?

140
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,570
You're not going to try and change my mind?

141
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,970
You must have thought it was possible.

142
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:23,270
Otherwise, what are you doing here all dolled up?

143
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,470
I came to ask for the part.

144
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:32,930
Well...

145
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:35,900
The truth is...

146
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:39,840
When I look at you, all I see is the White Swan.

147
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:44,080
Yes, you're beautiful, fearful, fragile.

148
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:45,890
Ideal casting.

149
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,250
But the Black Swan? It's a hard fucking job to dance both.

150
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,950
I can dance the Black Swan, too.

151
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,090
Really?

152
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,180
In four years, every time you dance,

153
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:03,060
I see obsess getting each and every move perfectly right, but I never see you lose yourself.

154
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,180
Ever. All that discipline for what?

155
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:12,620
- I just want to be perfect. - You what?

156
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,430
I want to be perfect.

157
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,590
Perfection is not just about control.

158
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:24,210
It's also about letting go.

159
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:28,880
Surprise yourself so you can surprise the audience. Transcendence.

160
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:31,120
And very few have it in them.

161
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,740
I think I do have it in me.

162
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:42,580
You bit me?

163
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:45,680
I can't believe you bit me!

164
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:47,290
I'm sorry.

165
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,500
Man, that fucking hurt!

166
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,110
What?

167
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:09,320
Why's she always staring at me?

168
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,680
Hey, it's been posted.

169
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,270
Hey, it's up!

170
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,030
Veronica.

171
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:26,070
Congratulations.

172
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,530
Hey!

173
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:44,770
Why would you say that?

174
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,970
Your idea of some sick joke?

175
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:49,370
What?

176
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:51,840
Fuck you.

177
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:06,810
Hey, Nina!

178
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,270
Congratulations!

179
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,050
Congratulations.

180
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:17,510
You're so beautiful.

181
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:20,500
Congratulations.

182
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,050
<i>- Hello?</i> - Hi.

183
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,030
<i>What is it? What's wrong?</i>

184
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,630
I'm fine.

185
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,170
He picked me, Mom.

186
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:50,510
Do you hear me?

187
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:53,390
<i>- For Swan Lake?</i> - I'm going to be Swan Queen!

188
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:56,850
Mom!

189
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:59,320
I'll be home soon. I just wanted to let you know.

190
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,420
<i>- I love you.</i> - I love you, too.

191
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:37,290
Mom?

192
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:42,030
Mom, are you in your room?

193
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:16,660
Nina?

194
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:18,130
Are you home?

195
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:32,420
Nina, when you get out I'm in the kitchen.

196
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:35,860
Come on, sweetie.

197
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,600
My daughter, the Swan Queen.

198
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:50,570
It's our favorite. Vanilla with strawberry filling.

199
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:52,160
Oh, Mom, not too big.

200
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,140
Oh, that's way, way too much.

201
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:56,260
- It's a celebration. It's just this once. - Mom...

202
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,760
My stomach's still in knots.

203
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:02,240
Fine.

204
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:04,100
Fine.

205
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:05,380
Then it's garbage!

206
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,630
No, Mom, don't. I'm sorry.

207
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:19,100
I'm just... I'm just so proud of you.

208
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:21,870
It looks so yummy.

209
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,250
Okay, okay.

210
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:36,760
Thank you. Thank you.

211
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:38,840
Thank you, Nina.

212
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,630
That's very nice.

213
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:42,810
Very nice.

214
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:47,620
But I knew the White Swan wouldn't be a problem.

215
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:51,350
The real work will your metamorphosis into her evil twin.

216
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:55,130
And I know I saw a flash of her yesterday.

217
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,440
So get ready to give me more of that bite.

218
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:21,760
Excellent.

219
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:27,780
That evil force is pulling you that you can't escape. That's just out of your control.

220
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:33,440
So you sense it, you get aware of it more: "It's taking me, it's taking me."

221
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:36,140
A little bit more desperate.

222
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:40,920
Right, and you can maybe go up a little bit and then come down, and then...

223
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:42,210
That's it.

224
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,560
Watch the way she moves.

225
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:23,900
Imprecise, but effortless.

226
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,410
She's not faking it.

227
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:36,530
Gorgeous! Okay, that's beautiful.

228
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:38,410
Let's start again from the beginning.

229
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:50,330
You'll room with Beth from now on, so be considerate.

230
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,700
Thanks, Susie.

231
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,150
Those are for you, from Mr. Leroy.

232
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:56,130
They're beautiful.

233
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:15,430
I'll be back in a second.

234
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:19,790
Let me come back to you, please.

235
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:24,140
Let's go.

236
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,390
Ready to be thrown to the wolves?

237
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:35,050
We need our cash, so please don't forget to smile.

238
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:39,410
Ladies and gentlemen, please, may I have your attention?

239
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:41,960
Good evening.

240
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,840
Let me make this very important announcement.

241
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:51,110
You all had had the chance and the privilege to be enchanted, transported,

242
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:53,910
and even sometimes devastated, by the performances

243
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,940
of this true artist of our company.

244
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:58,960
She's been a crucial inspiration to my work.

245
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,780
A role model to all dancers, and even more than that,

246
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,800
a deeply appreciated presence on our stage.

247
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,930
You all know who I am talking about.

248
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:11,270
Ladies and gentlemen, Beth Macintyre.

249
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:17,720
But as we all know,

250
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:20,130
every great career has to come to an end.

251
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:25,020
Beth is retiring at the end of season.

252
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:29,360
She will be giving her farewell performance as Melpomene,

253
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:31,920
the role she originated in my first ballet.

254
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,970
My little princess,

255
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:39,280
we honor you. You will be greatly missed,

256
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:42,370
and never forgotten.

257
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:46,470
But as we bid <i>adieu</i> to one star, we welcome another.

258
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:50,490
We're opening our season with my new version of <i>Swan Lake</i>.

259
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:55,500
Taking the role of our new Swan Queen, the exquisite Nina Sayers.

260
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,870
You'll soon have the pleasure of seeing her perform,

261
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:11,360
but right now, let's please raise a glass: To all of us. To Beth. To Nina.

262
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:14,480
To beauty.

263
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:33,320
Just a second.

264
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,520
Just a second!

265
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,670
Come on! I'm about to burst!

266
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:14,990
Hey, it's you!

267
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:17,600
I don't think we ever officially met.

268
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:20,290
- I'm Lily. - Hi, I'm Nina.

269
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,510
Yes, our new Swan Queen.

270
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,100
- Here, hold this. - Yeah, sure.

271
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:29,210
You must be so excited.

272
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,660
Are you freaking out?

273
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,740
- Yeah... - Yeah?

274
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:36,810
Oh, it's okay.

275
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,680
Oh, I'd be losing my mind.

276
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:40,940
I should get back...

277
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:42,670
No, no, no, come on, stay.

278
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:44,500
Keep me company.

279
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:49,000
Excuse me.

280
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:52,390
Oh, there you are. Come on.

281
00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:01,070
Hey. They tried to eat you alive, but here you are.

282
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,380
You did well.

283
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,790
- Really? - Mm-hmm.

284
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:06,870
Where are you going?

285
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:09,230
Upper west side.

286
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:11,040
Stop at my place for a drink. It's on the way.

287
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:14,830
Thomas, you need to say hello to Karen Holloway.

288
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:19,280
A minute more of ass-kissing. I'll be back. Wait for me here, all right?

289
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,310
Hello, Karen!

290
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:06,480
Beth!

291
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:10,420
I'm so sorry to hear you're leaving the company.

292
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,270
What did you do to get this role?

293
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:20,310
He always said you were such a frigid little girl.

294
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,460
What did you do to make him change his mind?

295
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:28,620
Did you suck his cock?

296
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:30,380
Not all of us have to.

297
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,560
You fucking whore!

298
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,960
You're a fucking little whore!

299
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,410
Whoa, what's going on here?

300
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:42,580
Hey, I need to talk to you.

301
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:44,740
- You're drunk. You should go home. - I need to talk to you.

302
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:48,460
No! Don't you do that! Don't you dismiss me like that!

303
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:53,640
My little princess, please. Pull it together.

304
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:57,050
- Come. - I'm coming by later.

305
00:35:57,090 --> 00:36:01,760
I have something for you. It's a token of my appreciation.

306
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,530
- Right. - You make the most of it, Nina.

307
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:07,090
Don't worry. It's typical.

308
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:15,890
Please. I thought it'd be good to talk about the role.

309
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,230
Drown this a little.

310
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:19,510
I don't want there to be any boundaries between us.

311
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:21,600
- No, me neither. - Good.

312
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:26,000
So... You got a boyfriend?

313
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,240
No.

314
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:32,120
Have you had many in the past?

315
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:34,190
A few.

316
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,880
But no one serious.

317
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,740
You're not a virgin are you?

318
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:45,940
No.

319
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:48,190
So there's nothing to be embarrassed about.

320
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,430
And you enjoy making love?

321
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:57,790
Excuse me?

322
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:59,970
Come on, sex.

323
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:01,410
Do you enjoy it?

324
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,260
We need to be able to talk about this.

325
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:16,070
I've got a little homework assignment for you.

326
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:20,560
Go home and touch yourself.

327
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,670
Live a little.

328
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,530
Well it's late. Lots of work tomorrow.

329
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:33,470
The doorman will find a cab for you.

330
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:40,840
Sounds like quite an evening. I wish I could have been there.

331
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,410
You know I asked.

332
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:44,220
I know you did. Susie told me.

333
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:47,130
Guess he wanted you all to himself.

334
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,280
But why?

335
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,710
Don't blame him.

336
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,170
Where'd you get these?

337
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,030
They're fake.

338
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:59,850
Fooled me.

339
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,140
I can do it.

340
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:14,340
He must have been by your side all night.

341
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:17,850
Showing you off.

342
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,840
- Oh, Nina... - It's just a rash.

343
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,040
Rash? What are you talking about?

344
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:25,650
It was worse a few days ago. It's fine already.

345
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:27,810
- You've been scratching yourself again. - No I haven't.

346
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:29,770
Mom!

347
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,240
This disgusting habit...

348
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:34,690
Jesus Christ, I thought you were done with this, Nina.

349
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,440
Shrugs. You'll keep wearing the shrugs.

350
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:38,820
Sit down. You have the white one,

351
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,880
and the pink one. And that'll hide it.

352
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:45,620
And then I'll dig out that expensive coverup. We still have some.

353
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,090
No one will see it.

354
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:49,740
Mom, please,

355
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:54,000
It's the role, isn't it? It's all this pressure.

356
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,910
I knew it'd be too much. I knew it.

357
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:00,680
You're all right.

358
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:04,050
You'll be all right.

359
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:09,310
Beth's in the hospital.

360
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,370
She had an accident.

361
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:14,070
Oh no!

362
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:14,540
Beth?

363
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:23,050
What happened?

364
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:27,390
She walked into the street and got hit by a car.

365
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,640
You know what?

366
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:34,390
I'm almost sure she did it on purpose.

367
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:36,910
How do you know?

368
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:41,930
Because everything Beth does comes from within, from some dark impulse.

369
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:45,850
I guess that's what makes her so thrilling to watch.

370
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:48,470
So dangerous.

371
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,900
Even perfect at times.

372
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:57,220
But also so damned destructive.

373
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:01,350
Was it right after we saw her?

374
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:05,270
Wait, wait, wait. This has nothing to do with you.

375
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:08,410
It's not your problem, so don't let yourself be distracted.

376
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:11,640
This is your moment, Nina.

377
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:14,220
Don't let it go.

378
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:44,850
What are you doing?

379
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:27,330
Nina?

380
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:31,090
Sweetie, are you ready for me?

381
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,660
And... Come on!

382
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,190
Forget about control, Nina. I want to see passion.

383
00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:49,020
Come on.

384
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:55,060
Stiff like a dead corpse. Let it go.

385
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:57,360
Let it go. Let it go.

386
00:45:57,390 --> 00:45:59,800
And again.

387
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:02,810
Feels like you have your diaphragm

388
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:05,570
is in a bit of a contraction?

389
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:06,720
I'm okay.

390
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:14,420
Breathe in to this hand. Breathe in to this hand.

391
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:16,520
Breathe in, all the way. Good.

392
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,230
And exhale.

393
00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:24,960
Does it feel jammed in the front every time you <i>plie</i>?

394
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,770
Sometimes, not always.

395
00:46:30,810 --> 00:46:31,720
- One more pull, okay? - Okay.

396
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:38,200
- Is that okay? - Yeah.

397
00:46:58,970 --> 00:47:00,880
David, can I ask you a question?

398
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:03,130
Honestly, would you fuck that girl?

399
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,000
No.

400
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,570
No one would.

401
00:47:10,090 --> 00:47:10,750
Nina...

402
00:47:10,790 --> 00:47:13,970
Your dancing is just as frigid...

403
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:16,390
Fuck!

404
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,350
We're still working here, please. Lights!

405
00:47:23,390 --> 00:47:24,800
The lights!

406
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:26,910
Thank you!

407
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:30,540
Okay, guys, you can go. Thanks for your patience.

408
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:33,480
No, no, you stay. You stay.

409
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:37,070
Have fun, you two.

410
00:47:41,010 --> 00:47:41,440
Okay

411
00:47:41,470 --> 00:47:42,750
Come here.

412
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:43,790
Come, come, come, come.

413
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:47,820
I'll be the Prince.

414
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:09,910
Let it go. Let it go.

415
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:32,600
Feel my touch.

416
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:33,780
Respond to it.

417
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:35,070
Come on.

418
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:50,560
Open your mouth. Open it. Open up.

419
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:18,500
That was me seducing you,

420
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:21,230
when it needs to be the other way around.

421
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:22,370
Please...

422
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:47,270
Who is that?

423
00:49:48,390 --> 00:49:48,840
Hey.

424
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:52,300
You okay?

425
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:55,970
You can't smoke in here.

426
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,590
Well, I won't tell if you won't.

427
00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:03,970
So...

428
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,840
The big day's getting closer and closer, huh?

429
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:12,380
Well, I can't wait. I think you're going to be amazing.

430
00:50:14,530 --> 00:50:14,890
Thanks.

431
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:31,130
So...

432
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:33,770
Do  you want to talk about it?

433
00:50:36,330 --> 00:50:38,580
It's that hard to.

434
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:41,870
Leroy playing a little too rough for you?

435
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:44,620
Come on, Nina. He's a prick.

436
00:50:44,650 --> 00:50:46,680
He's brilliant.

437
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:50,100
Sure, but it's not like he's all warm and fuzzy.

438
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:53,040
What you don't know is...

439
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:58,160
Someone's hot for teacher!

440
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:02,280
Oh, come on, it's okay. I don't blame you.

441
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:03,710
I should go home.

442
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:06,460
Nina, come on. I'm just playing around.

443
00:51:06,490 --> 00:51:09,040
Nina!

444
00:52:29,910 --> 00:52:33,170
Sweetie? What are you doing in there?

445
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:01,950
Again.

446
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:36,250
Again.

447
00:53:48,110 --> 00:53:49,830
Do you have any corrections?

448
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:56,990
Lily told me that she saw you crying.

449
00:53:58,950 --> 00:54:00,490
That you were very upset

450
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:02,430
and that I should take it easy on you.

451
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:03,980
I didn't tell her that.

452
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:06,420
Maybe you need a little break.

453
00:54:06,450 --> 00:54:09,320
A day or two. Or maybe a month. What do you think?

454
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:10,540
She shouldn't have said anything.

455
00:54:10,570 --> 00:54:12,700
No, you shouldn't be whining in the first place.

456
00:54:12,730 --> 00:54:13,480
I didn't.

457
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:18,330
You could be brilliant.

458
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:20,270
But you're a coward.

459
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:22,600
Sorry.

460
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:25,100
No, stop saying that! That's exactly what I'm talking about.

461
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:26,650
Stop being so fucking weak.

462
00:54:26,690 --> 00:54:28,080
Again!

463
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:41,940
Lily...

464
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:45,060
Oh, look who's decided to grace us with her presence.

465
00:54:45,090 --> 00:54:46,020
I need to talk to you.

466
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:46,970
Okay.

467
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,460
Now.

468
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:50,330
Shut up.

469
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:51,580
Come on.

470
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:56,160
What's up?

471
00:54:56,190 --> 00:54:58,810
You told Thomas about last night?

472
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:03,400
Oh, yeah. I ran into him in the morning and he said you guys were having some trouble.

473
00:55:03,430 --> 00:55:04,520
Why would he talk to you?

474
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:07,220
Oh, excuse me, your highness.

475
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:11,110
I just told him you're working your ass off and I think you'll be great.

476
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:12,040
Well you shouldn't have.

477
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:16,920
Okay.

478
00:55:50,070 --> 00:55:51,350
Has he tried anything with you?

479
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:57,530
He has a reputation.

480
00:56:01,390 --> 00:56:04,700
I have a right to be concerned, Nina. You've been staying late so many nights.

481
00:56:04,730 --> 00:56:08,860
Rehearsing. I just hope he isn't taking advantage, that's all.

482
00:56:08,890 --> 00:56:10,300
He's not.

483
00:56:10,330 --> 00:56:11,950
Good.

484
00:56:14,790 --> 00:56:16,600
I just don't want you to make the same mistake I did.

485
00:56:18,330 --> 00:56:18,730
Thanks.

486
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:20,940
Not like that.

487
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:24,300
I just mean as far as my career was concerned.

488
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:25,240
What career?

489
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:30,950
The one I gave up to have you.

490
00:56:33,270 --> 00:56:34,310
I'm twenty-eight.

491
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:35,730
So?

492
00:56:36,410 --> 00:56:37,600
Only that...

493
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:40,660
Only what?

494
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:42,320
Nothing.

495
00:56:42,350 --> 00:56:43,590
- What? - Nothing.

496
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:48,320
How is your skin?

497
00:56:48,350 --> 00:56:50,430
Fine.

498
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:52,110
- Are you leaving it alone? - Mm-hmm.

499
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:55,900
Let me see.

500
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:02,400
- Take off your shirt. - No.

501
00:57:15,730 --> 00:57:16,100
Can I help you?

502
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:21,460
Who was that?

503
00:57:21,490 --> 00:57:23,040
It was no one.

504
00:57:25,210 --> 00:57:25,820
It was no one.

505
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:31,630
Hello?

506
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:37,150
What are you doing here?

507
00:57:37,190 --> 00:57:39,140
I just came by to apologize.

508
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:41,370
You're right. I should have never spoken to him about you.

509
00:57:41,410 --> 00:57:43,590
- Sweetheart. - Give me a second.

510
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:45,280
- Your dinner... - Mom, please.

511
00:57:47,570 --> 00:57:48,850
Oh, she's a trip.

512
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:50,250
How do you know where I live?

513
00:57:51,690 --> 00:57:52,780
I have my ways.

514
00:57:54,870 --> 00:57:57,200
Jesus, relax. I got it from Susie in the office.

515
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:01,770
Look, I feel really shitty about what I did, and I really want to make it up to you.

516
00:58:01,790 --> 00:58:04,050
So how about I take you out to dinner?

517
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:07,580
- I don't think... - Okay, that's fine.

518
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:09,840
What about drinks?

519
00:58:09,870 --> 00:58:11,510
Sweetie, you need to rest.

520
00:58:11,550 --> 00:58:13,750
- Jesus. - Wait.

521
00:58:15,590 --> 00:58:16,420
What are you doing?

522
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:18,600
I'm going out.

523
00:58:18,630 --> 00:58:20,170
What? Nina!

524
00:58:20,210 --> 00:58:22,880
You're on the stage tomorrow.

525
00:58:24,610 --> 00:58:26,100
I can't believe he calls her that.

526
00:58:26,130 --> 00:58:28,720
- It's so gross. - I think it's sweet.

527
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:30,580
Little Princess?

528
00:58:30,610 --> 00:58:33,050
- He probably calls every girl that. - No way.

529
00:58:33,090 --> 00:58:35,070
That's just for Beth.

530
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:39,710
Well, I bet he'll be calling you Little Princess any day now.

531
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:41,260
I don't know about that.

532
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:44,530
Oh, sure he will. Just got to let him lick your pussy.

533
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:48,330
Cheeseburger, extra bloody.

534
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:53,470
Let me know if that's juicy enough for you.

535
00:58:53,510 --> 00:58:55,310
Oh, I will.

536
00:58:57,330 --> 00:58:59,070
You have enough cheese?

537
00:58:59,110 --> 00:59:01,480
No, but you do.

538
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:04,880
Enjoy.

539
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:15,420
All right.

540
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:23,620
Wanna spruce up?

541
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:26,770
What, I carry a spare

542
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:30,030
in case I wake up somewhere unexpected.

543
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:35,450
So how is he?

544
00:59:38,130 --> 00:59:39,220
Thomas.

545
00:59:41,090 --> 00:59:42,220
I wouldn't know.

546
00:59:42,250 --> 00:59:45,640
- Oh, come on. - I really don't want to talk about that.

547
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:48,530
Okay.

548
00:59:50,370 --> 00:59:53,290
You really need to relax.

549
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:01,770
One for you,

550
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:03,770
one for me.

551
01:00:05,110 --> 01:00:08,980
Oh, and don't worry. It's pure, I promise. I brought it with me straight from San Francisco.

552
01:00:11,690 --> 01:00:12,380
What is it?

553
01:00:12,410 --> 01:00:14,470
Are you kidding?

554
01:00:16,170 --> 01:00:17,700
You've never rolled?

555
01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:23,290
Oh, relax. Here. It'll loosen you up.

556
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:27,280
Wait till you see the night sky.

557
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:32,460
How long does it last?

558
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:34,990
A couple hours, tops.

559
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:41,240
It's okay.

560
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:43,900
Okay.

561
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:47,380
Nina, hi!

562
01:01:47,410 --> 01:01:53,940
I thought we could use some company. So this is Tom and this is Jerry.

563
01:01:53,970 --> 01:01:57,630
- Actually it's Andrew. - Tom.

564
01:01:57,670 --> 01:02:01,330
- I have to go... - Oh, no you can't go. I just got us some drinks.

565
01:02:02,540 --> 01:02:03,650
I shouldn't...

566
01:02:03,690 --> 01:02:05,470
We're on the stage tomorrow.

567
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:07,600
So what are you going to do? Go home to Mommy?

568
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:12,970
Come on, live a little.

569
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:19,030
It's just a couple hours, right?

570
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:21,470
Tops.

571
01:02:25,810 --> 01:02:26,410
Cheers.

572
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:30,000
You haven't told me who you are.

573
01:02:30,990 --> 01:02:32,380
I'm a dancer.

574
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:33,970
No, I mean your name.

575
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:36,980
- Oh. Nina. - So are you two sisters?

576
01:02:37,010 --> 01:02:37,930
- Yes. - No.

577
01:02:37,950 --> 01:02:42,280
- Blood sisters. - We dance in the same company.

578
01:02:42,310 --> 01:02:46,020
Ah, ballerinas. No wonder you two look alike.

579
01:02:46,060 --> 01:02:49,010
I see now. Tom and Jerry here are gay lovers.

580
01:02:49,050 --> 01:02:51,000
- Very funny. - I like to amuse myself.

581
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:52,490
I've never been to the ballet.

582
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:55,430
Then you are definitely not gay.

583
01:02:55,470 --> 01:02:57,380
I mean, it's kind of boring, isn't it?

584
01:02:57,410 --> 01:02:58,530
- Be honest. - No it's not.

585
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:01,570
You know what? It's just not for everyone.

586
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:04,480
You should come sometime. I can comp you tickets whenever you want.

587
01:03:04,510 --> 01:03:05,920
Yeah. Yeah.

588
01:03:06,790 --> 01:03:08,470
- Yeah, that would be neat. Thanks. - Okay well...

589
01:03:08,510 --> 01:03:10,460
I think it's time for another round.

590
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:13,960
Bottoms up.

591
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:19,950
So what are you guys working on now?

592
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:24,090
Sorry.

593
01:03:26,020 --> 01:03:27,910
<i>Swan Lake</i>.

594
01:03:27,950 --> 01:03:29,210
Yeah?

595
01:03:29,250 --> 01:03:30,900
You know it?

596
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:32,800
No, not really.

597
01:03:32,810 --> 01:03:33,840
Heard of it.

598
01:03:33,870 --> 01:03:35,270
What's it about?

599
01:03:36,620 --> 01:03:38,870
It's about a girl who gets turned into a swan,

600
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:41,480
and she needs love to break the spell.

601
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:46,160
But her prince falls for the wrong girl,

602
01:03:48,940 --> 01:03:50,200
and so she kills herself.

603
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:53,440
It's not a happy ending then.

604
01:03:53,470 --> 01:03:56,610
It's beautiful, actually.

605
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:00,860
Like you.

606
01:04:01,990 --> 01:04:02,940
Huh?

607
01:04:04,180 --> 01:04:05,200
I said you're beautiful.

608
01:04:09,230 --> 01:04:10,020
That's funny?

609
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:22,340
Looks like someone might be rolling.

610
01:04:22,370 --> 01:04:25,650
All right, come on. Come on, it's time to go dance.

611
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:49,110
Nina!

612
01:05:25,730 --> 01:05:28,230
Hey, what the fuck? Where you going?

613
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:51,820
Nina!

614
01:05:53,220 --> 01:05:54,090
Where are you going?

615
01:07:17,870 --> 01:07:20,150
Do you have any idea what time it is?

616
01:07:20,190 --> 01:07:22,050
Late?

617
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:26,100
Where have you been?

618
01:07:26,910 --> 01:07:29,080
To the moon and back.

619
01:07:31,140 --> 01:07:33,520
- You've been drinking. - Ding ding ding ding ding!

620
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:35,260
- What else? - Hmm?

621
01:07:35,270 --> 01:07:37,820
What else have you been doing?

622
01:07:39,510 --> 01:07:41,430
Oh, you want to know their names?

623
01:07:43,620 --> 01:07:47,320
- You need to sleep this off. - There were two. Tom and Jerry.

624
01:07:47,340 --> 01:07:49,760
- Be quiet, Nina. - And I fucked them both.

625
01:07:49,780 --> 01:07:51,850
Shut your mouth!

626
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:05,980
- Don't come in here. - What's this?

627
01:08:06,010 --> 01:08:09,380
It's called privacy. I'm not twelve anymore.

628
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:11,960
- You're not my Nina right now... - Leave me alone!

629
01:10:09,980 --> 01:10:11,450
Sweat girl.

630
01:11:08,590 --> 01:11:09,870
Why didn't you wake me up?

631
01:11:12,750 --> 01:11:13,620
I'm moving out.

632
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:19,110
My music!

633
01:11:36,990 --> 01:11:38,410
Thomas, I am so sorry.

634
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:40,320
Keep on going.

635
01:11:41,910 --> 01:11:42,970
Go get warmed up.

636
01:12:25,650 --> 01:12:26,210
That was good.

637
01:12:28,830 --> 01:12:29,700
Actually, really good.

638
01:12:29,730 --> 01:12:31,900
Okay, let's take ten.

639
01:12:40,140 --> 01:12:42,490
Look, he just wanted to mark it and asked me to step up, okay?

640
01:12:43,410 --> 01:12:44,630
I overslept.

641
01:12:45,580 --> 01:12:48,330
Oops. But hey, at least you had a good time, right?

642
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:50,000
You put something in my drink.

643
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:51,830
Yeah.

644
01:12:51,870 --> 01:12:53,540
And then you just took off in the morning.

645
01:12:54,990 --> 01:12:55,720
In the morning?

646
01:12:55,750 --> 01:12:57,690
Yeah, you slept over.

647
01:13:00,250 --> 01:13:01,110
Um, no.

648
01:13:02,850 --> 01:13:05,500
Unless your name's Tom and you had a dick.

649
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:09,130
What, Nina?

650
01:13:14,860 --> 01:13:18,180
Did you have some sort of lesbian wet dream about me?

651
01:13:18,220 --> 01:13:20,620
- Stop. - Oh my God!

652
01:13:20,660 --> 01:13:23,960
Oh my God, you did! You fantasized about me!

653
01:13:23,980 --> 01:13:26,410
- Shut up! - Was I good?

654
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:11,850
The final act.

655
01:15:11,860 --> 01:15:13,840
You're trying to dance.

656
01:15:16,230 --> 01:15:19,470
You've tasted your dream! Touched it!

657
01:15:21,730 --> 01:15:23,830
Only to have it crushed!

658
01:15:27,180 --> 01:15:28,920
Your heart is broken,

659
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:32,280
wounded. Your life force fading.

660
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:36,000
The blood drips.

661
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:42,260
The Black Swan stole your love. There is only one way to end the pain.

662
01:15:44,390 --> 01:15:47,890
You are not fearful, but filled with acceptance.

663
01:15:50,140 --> 01:15:53,150
And you look down at Rothbart,

664
01:15:53,150 --> 01:15:54,270
and then at the Prince,

665
01:15:56,340 --> 01:15:59,390
and then, yes, at the audience.

666
01:15:59,420 --> 01:16:02,510
And then you jump.

667
01:16:06,110 --> 01:16:08,170
Go ahead. Jump. Jump!

668
01:16:19,430 --> 01:16:22,540
Okay, everybody get a drink of water, then it's notes.

669
01:16:34,740 --> 01:16:35,940
You lost weight.

670
01:16:35,970 --> 01:16:37,580
Take off your shrug, please.

671
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:50,080
Very good.

672
01:16:56,850 --> 01:16:58,330
Face front. We're almost done.

673
01:17:02,590 --> 01:17:04,610
And that's it. Okay.

674
01:17:04,650 --> 01:17:06,740
We're done. Thank you very much.

675
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:12,150
Georgina, I'm Lily. Thomas sent me...

676
01:17:12,190 --> 01:17:14,990
Yes, we have to get you measured for the Swan Queen costumes.

677
01:17:15,030 --> 01:17:16,150
What's she doing here?

678
01:17:18,310 --> 01:17:19,720
He made me your alternate.

679
01:17:21,830 --> 01:17:22,870
Look, it's just in case.

680
01:17:25,510 --> 01:17:27,990
Thomas. Thomas.

681
01:17:28,010 --> 01:17:29,120
- Thomas. - Yes?

682
01:17:29,150 --> 01:17:31,270
It can't be her.

683
01:17:31,310 --> 01:17:33,170
It can't be her.

684
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:34,690
Okay, why don't you just go. I'll catch up later.

685
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:36,470
What's going on?

686
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:39,540
Lily... You made her my alternate?

687
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:43,830
There's always an alternate. Lily is the best choice.

688
01:17:43,870 --> 01:17:45,270
No, she wants my role.

689
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:47,640
Every dancer in the world wants your role.

690
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:50,170
No, this is different. She is after me.

691
01:17:50,210 --> 01:17:53,620
- She is trying to replace me. - Nobody is after you.

692
01:17:53,660 --> 01:17:56,500
- No, please believe me...

693
01:17:59,060 --> 01:18:04,370
I know it's been a struggle. But you just had a breakthrough this morning.

694
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:10,780
Tomorrow is yours. Just give a great performance and you won't have to worry about Lily or anybody else.

695
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:15,410
Now go home and rest.

696
01:18:29,210 --> 01:18:31,130
From the vision again.

697
01:18:48,710 --> 01:18:49,260
What happened?

698
01:18:51,370 --> 01:18:55,360
I've got a life.don't work too hard. It's a big day tomorrow.

699
01:19:40,150 --> 01:19:41,440
I'm still working in here.

700
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:53,450
Could you please turn the lights back on?

701
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:00,050
Hello?

702
01:21:48,380 --> 01:21:49,470
What are you doing here?

703
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:51,410
I'm so sorry.

704
01:21:51,450 --> 01:21:53,740
I'm so sorry.

705
01:21:53,780 --> 01:21:58,360
I know how it feels now. She's trying to replace me.

706
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:00,970
What do I do?

707
01:22:03,030 --> 01:22:05,410
You stole my things?

708
01:22:05,450 --> 01:22:08,080
I was just trying to be perfect, like you.

709
01:22:10,940 --> 01:22:11,680
Perfect?

710
01:22:17,590 --> 01:22:18,820
I'm not perfect.

711
01:22:21,410 --> 01:22:22,330
I'm nothing.

712
01:22:25,290 --> 01:22:27,890
Nothing!

713
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:38,100
Nothing, nothing!

714
01:23:25,160 --> 01:23:26,040
Sweet girl.

715
01:23:47,470 --> 01:23:47,940
Mommy?

716
01:23:53,020 --> 01:23:54,370
Sweet girl. Sweet girl.

717
01:23:58,290 --> 01:24:00,520
Stop!

718
01:24:09,310 --> 01:24:10,190
What are you doing?

719
01:24:12,980 --> 01:24:13,590
Sweetie?

720
01:24:20,860 --> 01:24:22,070
Nina?

721
01:24:22,100 --> 01:24:23,850
Nina!

722
01:24:23,890 --> 01:24:25,160
Go away!

723
01:24:26,660 --> 01:24:27,610
Open the door!

724
01:24:27,640 --> 01:24:28,840
Go away!

725
01:24:37,650 --> 01:24:39,420
Open the door, Nina!

726
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:41,560
Nina!

727
01:24:54,300 --> 01:24:54,870
Get out!

728
01:24:54,900 --> 01:24:57,150
- What's wrong with you? - Get out!

729
01:24:57,180 --> 01:24:59,180
- Get out! - What do you see?

730
01:24:59,220 --> 01:25:00,890
Get out!

731
01:25:39,670 --> 01:25:40,800
It's okay.

732
01:25:42,060 --> 01:25:42,910
I'm here.

733
01:25:46,980 --> 01:25:49,390
You were scratching all night.

734
01:25:49,430 --> 01:25:51,690
Where's my clock?

735
01:25:51,730 --> 01:25:54,020
- Don't worry about that. - What time is it?

736
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,300
- The show is tonight, I have to... - No, no, no, no.

737
01:25:57,310 --> 01:25:58,600
Don't worry.

738
01:25:58,630 --> 01:26:01,610
I called the theater and I told them you aren't feeling well.

739
01:26:01,650 --> 01:26:02,750
I have to go!

740
01:26:02,780 --> 01:26:04,340
- No. No, you don't. - Let go of me.

741
01:26:07,330 --> 01:26:09,080
You're staying in here until you feel better.

742
01:26:09,110 --> 01:26:10,600
Where is it?

743
01:26:12,300 --> 01:26:14,010
This role is destroying you.

744
01:26:15,700 --> 01:26:17,300
- Move. Move! - Nina...!

745
01:26:17,340 --> 01:26:20,760
- What happened to my sweet girl? - She's gone!

746
01:26:21,490 --> 01:26:23,770
Nina! Oh, Nina!

747
01:26:24,720 --> 01:26:25,510
No, please!

748
01:26:25,550 --> 01:26:27,680
- You're not well! - Let go of me!

749
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:29,390
You can't handle this.

750
01:26:29,420 --> 01:26:31,250
I can't?

751
01:26:31,290 --> 01:26:34,330
I'm the Swan Queen. You're the one who never left the corps.

752
01:26:35,900 --> 01:26:36,660
Nina!

753
01:26:53,130 --> 01:26:53,930
What are you doing here?

754
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:55,190
Nina?

755
01:26:55,230 --> 01:26:57,140
She was supposed to be sick.

756
01:26:56,970 --> 01:26:58,620
Give us a minute.

757
01:27:04,020 --> 01:27:04,570
Are you okay?

758
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:06,230
I'm fine.

759
01:27:09,530 --> 01:27:11,510
Nina.

760
01:27:13,300 --> 01:27:14,540
Nina.

761
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:15,950
What?

762
01:27:15,980 --> 01:27:18,660
I've already asked Lily.

763
01:27:18,700 --> 01:27:20,640
Have you announced it?

764
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:26,720
After Beth, do you really need another controversy?

765
01:27:31,190 --> 01:27:32,790
I'm here, Thomas.

766
01:27:32,830 --> 01:27:34,300
I'm doing it.

767
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:42,900
The only person standing in your way is you.

768
01:27:42,940 --> 01:27:47,590
It's time to let it go. Lose yourself.

769
01:28:02,740 --> 01:28:04,340
White Swan, up in ten.

770
01:28:58,300 --> 01:29:00,020
What are you doing? You need to be upstage.

771
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:02,260
You suck.

772
01:31:03,860 --> 01:31:05,280
Okay, Nina.

773
01:31:44,390 --> 01:31:45,100
What the fuck?

774
01:32:30,300 --> 01:32:32,190
- Are you okay? - Nina, are you okay?

775
01:32:41,730 --> 01:32:43,030
Can you tell me what the fuck happened?

776
01:32:46,790 --> 01:32:48,620
- It wasn't my fault. He dropped me. - This is a fucking disaster.

777
01:32:56,900 --> 01:33:00,410
Rough start, huh? Must have been pretty humiliating.

778
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:03,490
Get out of my room.

779
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:05,940
I'm worried about the next act.

780
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:09,700
I'm just not sure you're feeling up to it.

781
01:33:09,730 --> 01:33:11,230
Stop. Please stop.

782
01:33:11,270 --> 01:33:16,520
How about I dance the Black Swan for you?

783
01:33:18,810 --> 01:33:21,280
Leave me alone!

784
01:33:33,260 --> 01:33:33,880
My turn!

785
01:33:34,850 --> 01:33:35,500
My turn!

786
01:33:35,540 --> 01:33:37,290
My turn!

787
01:33:44,420 --> 01:33:46,100
It's my turn!

788
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:07,180
Black Swan, places in five.

789
01:37:10,050 --> 01:37:11,930
Come on.

790
01:37:39,630 --> 01:37:41,450
Good job. Fifteen to the last act.

791
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:30,300
Hey. You were amazing.

792
01:38:30,330 --> 01:38:34,050
Seriously, I know that things got a little messed up between us,

793
01:38:34,090 --> 01:38:37,490
but I mean, holy shit, you completely blew me away!

794
01:38:40,190 --> 01:38:42,130
Okay, well I guess that's it.

795
01:38:42,160 --> 01:38:43,900
So I'll let you finish. Bye.

796
01:42:08,580 --> 01:42:09,680
Can you hear them?

797
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:12,620
They love you!

798
01:42:12,660 --> 01:42:16,350
My little princess, I always knew you had it in you.

799
01:42:16,390 --> 01:42:19,010
Come on. Let's take you out.

800
01:42:25,230 --> 01:42:25,980
Go get some help.

801
01:42:26,020 --> 01:42:26,980
Go get some help!

802
01:42:27,020 --> 01:42:28,450
What did you do?

803
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:29,600
What did you do?

804
01:42:29,640 --> 01:42:33,800
- I felt it. - What?

805
01:42:33,830 --> 01:42:36,110
I felt perfect.

806
01:42:41,930 --> 01:42:43,130
I was perfect.

807
01:42:54,410 --> 01:42:56,840
Nina! Nina! Nina!
