- 你要把米奇也拍進來嗎？
- 是，他就要來了
- You bringing Micky in?
- Yeah, he's gonna come.
1993年馬薩諸塞州洛厄爾市
他也應該來
He should be here as well.
你認為他會回答問題嗎？
You think he'll answer questions?
他們說會是我們倆一起回答
They said it was
gonna be both of us here.
- 鏡頭正好對准我了嗎？
- 現在只要看我這里
- Am I looking right in the camera here?
- Just look at me, right here.
- 好吧，你不想我在采訪中看鏡頭嗎？
- 看這里
All right. You don't want me to look
in the camera with the...
- Right over here.
...interviews?
我12歲起開始練拳擊
I started boxing
when I was 12 years old,
當時我騙他們滿18歲還是別的什么
and I'd lie and say I was 18,
or whatever it was.
我換了全新的名字和其他一些東西
You know, I had a different
name and everything.
我是說，我不知道打了多少場
I mean, I don't know how many fights...
在我成為專業拳擊手之前
打了大概一百多場的樣子
I'd done a hundred, more than that,
before I turned professional.
- 到鏡頭前面去坐在那里
- 為什么我們要接受采訪？
- Go ahead and sit right there.
- Why we doing this?
- 我不想接受采訪
- 你想重來一遍？
- I don't wanna do this.
- You want to start again?
他是我弟弟，他知道的都是我教的
This is my younger brother.
I taught him everything he knows.
我還是他的教練，盡管我倆拳擊技法不一樣
I'm still his trainer.
You know, we got different styles.
我他媽的身法敏捷，動如脫兔
I'm fuckin' squirrelly as fuck.
I'm like... I'm not even there.
這話是舒格﹒雷說的
You know, that's what Sugar Ray said.
他說我是他見過的最難纏的拳擊手
I was the most tricky fighter
he'd ever come across.
迪奇﹒埃克隆對舒格﹒雷﹒倫納德
馬薩諸塞州波士頓，1978年7月18日
在1978年的時候
我跟舒格﹒雷﹒倫納德打過
In '78, I fought Sugar Ray Leonard.
我跟他近戰，他都不能近我身
I went toe-to-toe with him.
He couldn't get to me.
他都不能近我身
He couldn't get to me.
他們稱我為：驕傲，“洛厄爾之驕傲”
They called me the pride...
the pride of Lowell.
現在大家還常說起此事，尤其是我弟弟
Everybody still talks about it,
especially my brother.
他每時每刻都夢想到達我的高度
His whole life he wanted
to do what I did, you know?
不過我倆是不同的拳擊手
But we're very different fighters.
米奇出拳很重
Micky's, you know,
he's a heavy hitter.
強勁的擊打
He's got... a thunderous,
雷擊般強力的左勾拳
I'm telling you,
thunderous left punch.
米奇會靠近你，他抗擊打能力很強
Micky, he gets you
and he takes a punishment,
我不知道為什么他那么做
你只有身臨其境才知道
I don't know why he does it,
till you're right fuckin' in there.
他喜歡近身肉搏，我喜歡游擊移動
He likes getting on the inside,
I stay on the outside.
本片根據真實事件改編
別鬧了
Come on.
迪奇
Dicky.
你能過來下么？
Would you come on?
你能停會么？幫我干完這活
Will you stop?
You gotta help me finish this.
還鬧！
Come on!
- 結果會和往常一樣
- 好吧
- And predictable as ever.
- All right.
- 不用神探科倫坡也知道誰會贏
- 來
- You don't need to be Columbo
- Here you go.
看看這局誰會贏
To see where this fight is headed.
砰！一記右拳就把米奇﹒沃德打倒了！
Bam! Over right hand
puts Micky Ward down!
HBO在拍一部我復出的電影！
HBO's making a movie
on me and my comeback!
還有我弟弟下周要在亞特蘭大
痛扁賽奧爾﹒曼比！
And my brother is gonna beat
Saoul Mamby in Atlantic City next week!
“洛厄爾之驕傲”回來了！
The pride of Lowell is back!
哈哈！誰還想試試？！
Quacka!
Who wants some?!
誰還想試試？！
片名：《斗士》
Who wants some?!
* 曾有段時間 *

（拳擊海報簽名中）
* 你現在覺得我這樣如何？ *
* 你現在覺得我這樣如何？ *
我要復出了
Making my comeback.
* 你現在覺得我這樣如何？ *
嘿，淘氣鬼們，在這干嘛？
Hey, naughty, naughty.
What's going on here?
* 你現在覺得我這樣如何？ *
* 記得當時 *
嘿，米奇迪奇，合張照
Hey, Dicky, Micky!
Take my picture.

* 所以如果我… *
怎么了？嘿，美女
What's going on? Hey, beautiful.
* 如果我對你不忠你是否會一眼看穿？ *
* 如果我唱首很憂傷很憂傷的曲子 *
你還和她搞過？
Did you tap that?
我不記得了，我有我擦淚記不住綜合症
我勒個去記不住啊
I can't remember. I got CRS:
I Can't Remember Shit!
* 你是否還會給我…？ *
嘿，杰瑞﹒加西亞！
Hey, Jerry Garcia!
你這個蠢蛋
Are you nuts?
怎么到這了？隨便轉轉？
How'd you get here?
You drive around?
* 你現在覺得我這樣如何？ *
嘿，雷，嘿，我愛你
Hey, Ray. Ray. I love you, Ray.
* 你現在覺得我這樣如何？ *
你做的很好
* 你現在覺得我這樣如何？ *
You're doing well.
* 你現在覺得我這樣如何？ *
你還沒趴下，繼續吧
You're walking. Get on it.
- 我們弄錯了？
- 不，他會來的
- We make a mistake?
- Nah, I mean, he'll be here.
像我說的，有時候他有他自己的打算
You know, like I said,
sometimes he goes on his own schedule
但他一來我們就會刻苦訓練的
他逼我逼得最緊了
but when he gets here, we work hard.
You know, nobody pushes me harder.
他本該現在訓練你的，對吧？
He's supposed to be
training you right now, right?
你干脆跟我姐姐們說會話
她們能說得你耳朵生繭
Why don't you just go talk to them,
my sisters? They'll talk your ear off.
你得花錢才能讓她們閉嘴
You gotta pay them to shut up.
他可以講講迪奇怎么幫他的
He can tell you
how Dicky was helping him.
說說，米奇
Yeah, come on, Micky.
- 奧基夫！
- 嘿，我們不知道迪奇去哪了！
- O'Keefe!
- Hey, we don't know where Dicky is.
你知道他在哪
You know where he is.
那個蠢警察在那干嘛？ 姑娘們，迪奇呢？
What's that Keystone Kop
doing in there? Where's Dicky? Girls?
- 我不知道
- 你沒有看見你兄弟？
- I don't know.
- Did you see him, your brother?
- 今早沒有
- 看看媽媽！
- Not this morning?
- Look at Ma!
為電影盛裝而來？
All dressed up for the movie, huh?
- 哇！
- 奧基夫，從拳擊台上下來
- Wow!
- Get outta the ring, O'Keefe.
我的迪奇才該在上面
My Dicky should be doing that, huh?
你家迪奇不在這，愛麗絲
Your Dicky ain't here, Alice.
米奇有場很重要的比賽
而他卻不訓練自己的弟弟
Micky's got an important fight
coming up and he's not training.
不管了，別理他了
Don't. Just forget about him.
他是非重要人物
他不參加電影的拍攝，是吧？
He's number two man.
He's not part of this, all right?
- 米奇沒接受正確的訓練
- 你拍到我走來的鏡頭嗎？
- He's not being handled right.
- You get me coming in all right?
你想我重走一次嗎？
You want me to do that again?
奧基夫，從拳擊台上下來，迪奇才是教練
Get out of the ring, O'Keefe.
Dicky's the trainer.
- 我是在幫忙，愛麗絲
- 我在這里給你們看
- I'm doing a favor, Alice.
- I will show you over here
這是我收集了好多年的剪貼簿
these scrapbooks
I've been collecting for years.
米奇以前常常跟著他哥哥到處跑
Micky used to follow
his big brother everywhere.
是他教會你一切，是吧，親愛的？
Taught ya everything, didn't he, honey?
在1978年，我們受邀
跟舒格﹒雷﹒倫納德比賽
In '78, we got the offer
to fight Sugar Ray Leonard.
哦，天吶，你看過錄像沒？
Oh, my God, it was...
Have you seen that video?
哦，你是HBO的記者，你得再看一次，來嘛
Oh, you're from HBO.
You gotta see it again. Come on.
阿特，錄像放哪了？
Art, Art, where's the video at?
體育專題節目
今晚我兒子會令所有人驚訝
并打敗舒格﹒雷﹒倫納德
Tonight, my son is gonna surprise
everybody and beat Sugar Ray Leonard.
相信我，我很清楚
Believe me, I know it.
舒格﹒雷今晚可能會有麻煩了
Sugar Ray might have
some trouble tonight.
這是件好事，他到此與一位優秀拳手較量
That's a good possibility.
He comes in here against a good boxer,
一個很能打的年輕人
a young man who can punch,
and I would like to say at this time
這次我想說在體格上他們旗鼓相當
that physically
they're just about equal.
倫納德倒下了
我們看看這是不是有效擊倒
Leonard is down.
Let's see if that's a knockdown.
不可思議
This is unbelievable.
埃克隆從他身上跨了過去
Eklund just walked over him!
沒人意識到剛剛發生了什么！
Nobody seems
to know what's happening!
迪奇做到了，是的，狡猾的迪奇成功了
Dicky did it.
Yeah. Tricky Dicky did it.
- 迪奇成功了
- 你現在不是應該在訓練米奇嗎？
- Dicky did it.
- Weren't you supposed to be
training Micky right now?
- 不，到9點才開始
- 現在已經他媽的11:45了！
- No, it ain't till 9:00.
- Dicky, it's fucking 11:45!
- 是真的，迪克
- 什么？！
- It's 11:45, Dick.
- What?!
你他媽的把車停哪了，布布？
Where'd you fuckin'
park the car, Boo Boo?!
不是我停的，是你停的，我沒有停
I didn't park it. You did.
I didn't park it.
看看你口袋里有鑰匙沒
Check your fuckin' pockets
for the keys.
- 鑰匙在你那吧？
- 不是我停的車，兄弟
- You got the keys, yeah?
- I didn't park it, man.
- 停在那邊？我不知道
- 看看你口袋，好吧？
- Down there? I don't know.
- Check your pockets, all right?
- 你真他媽瘋了！
- 靠
- You're fuckin' mental.
- Fuck it!
我得跑著去了，我他媽很久沒長跑了
I'll run. I need the fuckin' roadwork.
- 長跑？你瘋了？
- 他是跑步健將
- Roadwork? Are you crazy?
- He's a great runner.
嘿
Hey.
嘿！
Hey!
喂喂！
Quacka!
- 嘿，迪奇
- 晚來總比不來好
- Hey, Dicky.
- Better late than never.
看！神探到了
Oh, look! Detective's on the scene.
要來查清這件事的真相
Gonna get to the bottom of this.
- 理清頭緒了？
- 迪克，你是個混蛋
- Figure this one out, huh?
- Dick, you're an asshole.
等等，等等，我先弄清楚
Hold it, hold it.
Let me get this straight.
你們倆和米奇在一個拳擊館工作，是吧？
You guys are working in the same corner
as Micky, together, right?
對，對，他們倆都和我一起干，就是這樣
Yeah. Yeah, they're both in my corner,
and this is what goes on.
好
OK.
你沒別的工作要做嗎？
Don't you have
a job to go to or something?
真的，奧基夫應該去上班了
Really, O'Keefe has a job
that he should be at.
嗯，奧基夫警官在這加班呢
Yeah, Sergeant
O'Keefe's working overtime here.
我們要對付的是賽奧爾﹒曼比
猶太人，黑人，前世界冠軍
So we got Saoul Mamby,
Jewish, black, former world champ.
我們對對手了解夠詳細了
I think we got all the bases covered.
而我的弟弟，已經連輸3場了
And my kid brother,
he's lost three fights in a row.
他不能習慣于輸，這會造成心理陰影
You know, he can't get used
to losing. It's a mental thing.
不過我們不會再輸給曼比了，對吧？
But we're gonna break
that with Mamby, right?
嗯，希望如此，如果我們訓練的話
Yeah, I hope, if we can train...
我們當然會訓練，別浪費時間了，麥克
We can train, right. Enough of you
wasting time, Mick. You know?
- 浪費時間？
- 已經過去一上午了！
- Wasting time?
- Half the fuckin' day's gone!
- 我們還得訓練
- 是，上午已經過了
- We got work to do.
- Yeah, half the day's gone,
- 那是因為我在等你
- 你想贏？
- and I been waiting here for you.
- You wanna win?
* 我喜歡所有人 *
* 我喜歡做任何事 *
* 在人群中，你絕對會找到我！*
* 就像太陽中炙熱的金屬 *
刺拳，二三四，左右
從右邊進攻，再次刺拳
Jab, two, three, four.
Left, right, punch right. Jab...
* 就像天空中可愛的小馬駒 *
* 就像聖人出現在集市上 *
再來一次！一二三四
And again! One, two, three, four...
一二三四五，刺拳，刺拳
One, two, three, four, five...
Jab, jab...
就是這樣！就是這樣！
There you go! There you go!
* 重生的聖人走進廣場 *
* 可憎之物整年不再出現 *
來，動起來！可能只要他放下失敗的包袱
Come on, move!
Might as well drop the weight,
我們會擊敗曼比
we're gonna out-box Mamby.
* 它有很多具象 *
* 扭曲不潔的空氣 *
- 拳套要發揮作用
- 頭，身體，頭
- Take it out on the mitts.
- Head, body, head.
這才是連擊，頭，身體，頭
* 在此處侵蝕殆盡 *
That's your fuckin' combo.
Head, body, head.
頭，身體，頭，身體，我家迪奇這么教他的
Head, body, head, body.
My Dicky taught him that.
舒格﹒雷會到場
You know,
Sugar Ray's gonna be there,
為ESPN解說比賽（美國娛樂體育節目電視網）
calling the fight for ESPN.
我自從打敗他之后就沒再見過他了
I ain't seen him
since I knocked him down.
貌似是14年前吧？
Like 14 years ago or somethin'. Right?
勾拳！
Hook!
讓我們打場真正的拳擊
Let's get
a real sparring going on here.
別讓自己丟臉
Don't wanna embarrass yourself.
別在舒格﹒雷面前給自己丟臉，知道嗎？
Don't wanna embarrass yourself
in front of Sugar Ray, do you, Mick?
- 他肯定不會的
- 來，頭，身體，頭
- You got him...
- Come on. Head, body, head!
靠
Fuck.
- 真他媽精彩，這才是你的重拳，麥克
- 天吶
- Fuckin' yeah. That's your punch, Mick.
- Oh, my God.
這才是你的重拳
That's your punch.
拳就該打在肝臟那兒
那是整個身體的脆弱點
That's your liver punch.
It shuts the whole fuckin' body down.
喬治的手指頭太胖了，連電話都撥不了
George's fingers are so fuckin' fat,
he can't even dial the phone!
嘿，看這個，塔爾
Hey, right there, Tar!
豎中指可沒用，喬治！
That's not helping, George!
- 等等，我搞不清楚了
- 什么？
- Hold on. Wait a minute. I'm confused.
- What?
- 我也搞不清楚了
- 我們都搞不清了
- Yeah, I'm confused, too.
- We're confused.
- 喬治是誰的老爸？
- 你搞不清楚？
- George is whose father?
- You're confused?
- 老迪克﹒埃克隆是迪奇的…
- 唐娜的，蓋爾的和菲莉斯的父親
- Dick Eklund Sr. Is Dicky's...
- Donna's, Gail's and Phyllis's father.
- 是迪克﹒埃克隆
- 是
- Is Dick Eklund.
- Yeah.
盡管愛麗絲也姓埃克隆，辛迪和凱西也是
And even though Alice is an Eklund,
so is Cindy and Cathy,
- 喬治真是他們的…
- 還有米奇
- George is really their...
- And Micky...
- 不，米奇和我的父親是…
- 謝里﹒沃德
- No. Micky and I are...
- Sherri Ward.
- 我們是沃德家的
- 沃德家
- We're Wards.
- The Wards.
其實并不是聽起來這樣
迪克﹒埃克隆和我早分居了
It's not the way it sounds. Dick Eklund
and I were separated, right?
然后就是喬治，只有喬治，他才是我的男人
And then there was George,
just George. George is my man.
- 喬治是我們的爸爸
- 在迪克之后，我就只有喬治一個男人
- Georgie's our poppa.
- After Dick, it was just George.
沙琳！沙琳！
Charlene! Charlene!
嘿，沙琳！
Hey, Charlene!
- 沙琳，來一口干
- 嗯，你來這邊
- We're doing shots with Charlene!
- Yeah, you get over here.
- 來，到這來
- 來，干了你的
- Come on! Come over here.
- Come on, drink yours.
數到三…，三
On the count of three... Three!
不錯，伙計們，嘿，再來一次
Good job, fellas.
Oh, hey, one more time.
你干嘛不找她說話？她人挺好的
Why don't you just go talk to her?
She's a nice girl.
我跟她說過你
I told her all about you.
我不想約她，她會拒絕的
I don't wanna ask her
if she's gonna say no.
抗拒不了那翹臀吧？
Can't beat that ass, can ya?
站起來，快去
Get out of the booth.
Come on. Come on.
你就打算一直站在那盯著我屁股看么？
Are you just gonna stand there
and stare at my ass?
你爸也盯著我屁股看，不過他跟我說話了
Your father stares at my ass,
but he talks to me.
他覺得你是最棒的
Thinks you're the greatest.
- 不過他沒告訴我你是啞巴
- 不用找了，小妞
- He didn't tell me you were mute.
- Keep the change, doll.
他告訴我你是肯尼﹒弗萊明的妹妹
He told me you're
Kenny Fleming's sister.
- 這是小費？
- 嗯，我給的小費
- This is a tip?
- Yeah, that's my tip.
你知道這個鈴會說什么嗎？
You know what the bell
says about this tip?
吝嗇雜種，小氣混蛋
Cheap bastard. Cheap fucker.
每天都來，給我這么少小費
Comes in here every day,
gives me shitty tips.
- 操
- 操你
- Fuck that.
- Yeah, fuck you, too.
- 別管她，伙計們
- 你是鋪路工，是嗎？
- Forget it, boys...
- You pave streets, right?
- 是，我還是拳擊手
- 是
- Yeah, I do. And I'm a fighter.
- Oh, yeah,
我聽說你是個墊腳石
I heard you were a stepping-stone.
- 我不是墊腳石
- 他們利用你
- No, I'm no stepping-stone.
- You're the guy they use,
和其他拳手比賽來抬高他們
against the other fighters
to move the other fighters up.
我有几場打得比較艱難，不過我可不弱
I've had a few tough fights,
but that's not who I am.
下一場會展示出我的實力
The next fight's gonna show who I am.
嗯，下一場他也會輸掉
Yeah, and he's
gonna lose that one, too.
蘇打威士忌，沙琳，給你也來一杯
Scotch and soda, Charlene.
And one for yourself.
扭扭你的小屁股，給我…
So move that sugar ass
and get my...
你得禮貌點
You be nice. OK?
放尊重點，不許對她無禮
Be respectful.
Don't disrespect her.
嘿，別傷了你的手，下周還有比賽呢
Hey, don't hurt your hands.
We got a fight next week.
你還得用那只手擦屁股呢
Besides, you wipe
your ass with that one.
別待在這，否則我揍扁你這混蛋
Don't lean up, or I'm gonna hit you
in the cocksucker.
- 他會打敗賽奧爾﹒曼比，說！
- 是，他會打敗曼比！
- He's gonna beat Saoul Mamby, say it!
- Yeah, he's gonna beat him!
聽懂了嗎？聽懂了嗎？
Right? Right? Hey!
- 嗯
- 這就對了
- Right.
- That's right!
我會把你的酒也喝了，給我他的酒
I'm gonna take your drink, as well.
I'm taking his drink.
這個家伙會當冠軍的，他人很不錯
Hey, this guy's gonna be champion.
He's a great guy.
也是個很棒的拳手，你不會選錯的
謝謝這杯酒
He's a great fighter. You can't
go wrong. Thanks for the drink.
那些攝像機在拍一部關于他的電影呢
Those cameras are makin'
a movie about him.
在HBO電視節目上
他打倒了舒格﹒雷﹒倫納德
He knocked down
Sugar Ray Leonard on HBO,
所以他們一直扛著攝像機拍攝他
that's why they're following him
around with the camera.
他們在拍攝有關他復出的電影
And now they're making
a movie about his comeback.
是啊，大家都在談論這事
不過你下面要和誰比賽？
Yeah, everybody's talking about it.
But who are you fightin'?
- 賽奧爾﹒曼比
- 賽奧爾﹒曼比？
- Saoul Mamby.
- Saoul Mamby?
- 什么人會起這種名字？
- 猶太黑人
- What kind of name is that?
- Black and Jewish.
他們哪兒找來的這人的？
Where did they find a guy like that?
他可不是小人物，前世界冠軍
He's no joke. Former world champ.
- 前任冠軍？
- 是
- Former champ?
- Yeah.
- 不過我和他實力相當
- 是嗎？
- I match up good with him though.
- Yeah?
- 是
- 這話什么意思？
- Yeah.
- What does that mean?
我步法更輕盈了，我徒手搏擊很厲害
Well, I got lighter, you know?
I have a reputation for brawlin',
不過我不跟他比徒手搏擊，我跟他比拳擊
but I'm not gonna brawl with him.
I'm gonna try and out-box him.
- 有什么不同嗎？
- 是
- And there's a difference?
- Yeah, you know.
徒手搏擊一定要一較高下，我打你，你打我
Brawlin', you slug it out.
I hit you, you hit me.
拳擊則是一場博弈，我得重拳擊倒他
Boxing's a chess game, you know?
I pick my punches to take him down.
不斷進攻頭，身體，頭，身體
And go head, body, head, body.
- 什么是“頭，身體，頭，身體”？
- 我打他的頭
- What is "head, body, head, body"?
- Well, I hit him in the head,
他的手就必須抬起來護住頭部
and then his hand's gonna go up
to protect himself,
就暴露了他的身體，然后我就打他的身體
so it opens up his body,
and then when I hit him in the body,
他的手又得下來，我再回去打頭
the hand goes back down,
I go back up to the head,
他手又回到頭部，我再來打他的身體
hand goes back up, hit him in the body.
不懂拳擊的人會覺得打中頭部
People who don't know fighting
think you can do a lot of damage
傷害比較大，但擊中對手身體傷害更大
hitting somebody in the head,
but you do more hitting 'em in the body.
你覺得我怎樣？可以和你約會嗎？
So what do you think?
Can I take you out?
你結婚了？
Are you married?
沒，結婚了怎么會約你出去？
No. Would I ask you out
if I was married?
- 你把我想成什么人了？
- 這種事時有發生，相信我
- What kind of guy do you think I am?
- Happens all the time. Trust me.
我不是那種人
I'm not like that.
我沒有結婚，我有個女兒
我每兩周去看她一次
I'm not married. I got a daughter.
I see her every other weekend.
她叫凱西，就這樣而已
Her name's Kasie. But that's it.
來，跟我約會吧
Come on. Let me take you out.
什么時候？
When?
周六晚，我從大西洋城回來
Saturday night.
I get back from Atlantic City.
- 這是真的號碼嗎？
- 你可以撥撥看
- Is this the real number?
- You have to call it and see.
我會的，周六，晚餐加電影
I will. Saturday. Dinner and a movie.
- 嘿，吉米
- 米奇，最近怎么樣
- Hey. Jimmy.
- Micky, hey. How's it going?
勞里肯定沒想到你現在會過來
I don't think Laurie's
expecting you right now.
他在這兒干嘛？
米奇，今天不是你探視的日子
What's he doin' here?
This isn't your visitation day, Micky.
我就想跟凱西問聲好
Look, I just want to say hi to Kasie.
今天不該你探視，再見
It's not your day. Good-bye.
是，但我下周末不在這兒
Yeah, but I'm not
around next weekend.
- 你放棄那些天的探視了？
- 不，我有比賽，我告訴過你的
- You ditchin' the days you do have?
- No, I have a fight. I told you that.
- 吉米…
- 我不能插手
- Jimmy...
- I can't get in the middle.
我無法和她說話了，好嗎？拜托了，吉米
I can't talk to her, OK?
So I'm asking you, Jimmy.
我現在想和我女兒說說話
I want to talk to my daughter. Now.
- 和你爸說話吧
- 該死，吉米
- Talk to your father.
- Goddamn it, Jimmy.
爸爸要和賽奧爾﹒曼比打
Daddy's gonna fight Saoul Mamby.
對，爸爸想贏了再告訴你的
That's right. I want
to tell you that after I win,
爸爸贏了就有丰厚的獎金
會搬進大點的公寓
I'm gonna start making good money,
and I'll move into a bigger apartment
我們以前說過的
那樣你就能跟我多住几天了，好嗎？
like we talked about
so you can live with me more days, OK?
- 好哦，更大的房子！
- 祝我好運，好不好？
- Yeah, bigger apartment!
- Wish me luck, all right?
別抱太大希望，凱西
你這么騙自己孩子很殘忍，米奇
Don't hold your breath, Kasie.
It's cruel to mislead your child, Micky.
祝你好運，爸爸
Good luck, Daddy.
謝謝，凱西，我愛你，甜心，再見，寶貝
Thanks, Kasie.
I love you, honey. Bye, baby.
他去哪了？
Where is he?
神吶，真他媽不可思議
Jesus Christ.
Un-fucking-believable.
- 別擔心了，搞什么名堂
- 別把煙噴我臉上
- Quit worrying, for crying out loud.
- Blow that shit in my face.
我知道不關我的事，我見了很多人
You know, it's none of my business.
I go to a lot of meetings,
他們都說：“放手由他去吧”
and they have a saying,
"Let Go and Let God."
- 你得放手由他去，米奇
- 是他教會了我一切
- You gotta let him go, Mick.
- He's taught me everything I know.
是他幫了我，沒有他就沒有我的今天
He's been in my corner.
I can't do it without him.
你已經沒他了，不也好好的
You're already doing it without him.
- 不，我沒有
- 你有
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.
你知道他在哪兒，干嘛不把他直接帶來？
Look, you know where he is.
Why don't you just go get him?
- 你能把他帶來嗎？
- 鬼才會去找他呢
- Can you get him?
- I'm not fuckin' going to get him.
那我們一批人和愛麗絲一起坐轎車去那兒？
我們不能那么做
Are we all gonna go over there in
the limo with Alice? We can't do that.
迪奇
Dicky.
- 你媽在外面呢
- 什么？
- Your mother's outside.
- What?
迪奇， 你媽在外面！在下面！
Dicky, your mother's outside!
She's down there!
說我不在
I'm not here.
- 不要這樣
- 什么？
- Oh, no.
- What?
- 我要去檢查…
- 迪奇，不要！
- I gotta go check...
- Dicky, no!
別這樣，迪奇！迪奇！
Don't, Dicky! Dicky!
- 他要…
- 迪奇
- He's goin'...
- Dicky...
- 最好離開這里
- 迪奇，不要！
...better get out of here.
- Dicky, no!
喂，你該死的在這干嘛？
Quacka, what the fuck are you doing?
你知道我們現在得去機場的
我們還得趕飛機呢
You know we gotta go to the airport
now. We got a flight to catch.
你知道這場比賽對我有多重要嗎
You know how important
this fight is to me.
別跟媽媽說我在這兒，可以嗎？
Hey, don't tell Ma I'm here,
all right?
- 她知道！
- 別，別
- She knows!
- No, no, no.
- 去屋后接我
- 你他媽
- Pick me up back at the house.
- Are you fucking...
- 我從后院走
- 她現在就在車道呢
- I'll go through the yards.
- She's in the driveway right now.
好吧，不過快點，她就站在車道上呢
All right, but hurry up.
She's in the fuckin' driveway.
- 我們還得去趕飛機
- 你這個婊子養的
- We got a flight to catch.
- You son of a bitch.
你弟弟走這天你就做這種事？！
You do this on the day your
brother's traveling?!
你這是干嘛？
What are you doing?
- 為什么你逼我打你？
- 你打他干什么？
- Why'd you make me do that?
- What the fuck you hit him for?
為什么你逼我打你？
Why'd you make me do that to you?
- 神吶！
- 天，迪奇！
- Jesus!
- Oh, my God, Dicky.
我正在趕去呢，媽媽
I was on my way! Ma...
- 你們在這里做什么？
- 你看來了吧
- What are you doing in this place?
- There you go. There you go.
為什么我們就不能有一次正常趕去機場呢？
Why can't we just go to the fuckin'
airport for once, please?
- 我們還有飛機要趕
- 愛麗絲， 你丈夫怎么辦呢？
- We got a plane to catch.
- Hey, Alice, what about your husband?
他躺在地上了，你都不幫他一下？
He's laying on the fuckin' ground.
You wanna help your husband?
你像個銀背大猩猩一樣跑來這兒干嘛？
What are you doing running in here
like a silverback fuckin' gorilla?
- 看在上帝份上，我們得找到他
- 是，你倒是找到他了
- We had to get him, for Chrissakes.
- Yeah, you got him all right.
你惹毛他了，兄弟
You got him, pal.
你看到曼比了？看到他怎么抬手防御了？
You see Mamby?
You see how Mamby's arm comes up?
這樣就暴露了他的側面
你就可以像玩彈球機一樣玩死他
Leaves his side open, you just
light him up like a pinball machine.
他會大出血，你絕不可能輸的，米奇，不會
He's gonna be pissin' blood.
No way you lose, Mick. No way.
- 嘿，盧
- 迪奇小子
- Hey, Lou.
- Dicky boy.
嘿，聽著，ESPN就不能
給我們弄個比這好點的房間嗎？
Hey, listen, what? ESPN can't
get us better rooms than this?
迪奇，現在別管什么房間了
I wouldn't worry about
the rooms right now, Dicky.
- 還有更大的事要頭疼
- 比如？
- We got bigger headaches.
- Like what?
- 醫生不讓曼比比賽
- 為什么？
- Doctor won't let Mamby fight.
- Why not?
- 他得了流感
- 曼比得了流感？
- He's got the flu.
- Mamby got the flu?
嗯
Yeah.
米奇，我們還是能比賽的
Micky, we can still have a fight.
- 和誰打？
- 邁克﹒曼津
- With who?
- Mike Mungin.
邁克﹒誰？曼津？誰？
Mike who, Mungin?
Who's that?
費城來的，他不是在監獄嗎？
Guy from Philly?
Isn't he in prison?
剛放出來几個月
我已經給所有人打過電話，查過所有地方
He's been out a few months. I've
called everybody, checked everywhere.
我只能找到他了
He's the only guy I could find.
我前几場比賽已經打得很累了，盧
本想著這場輕松點的
My last few fights were rough, Lou.
This one's supposed to be easier.
我們一直都在准備和曼比打
I mean, we've been fuckin'
preparing for Mamby.
是的，不過這家伙疏于訓練
Yeah, but this guy
just came off the couch.
整天無所事事，對米奇來說贏應該很輕松
He's been sittin' on his ass.
Could be an easy win for Mick.
喬伊﹒費雷爾，記得他嗎？
這人痛扁了他一頓
Joey Ferrell, remember him?
He knocked his ass out.
而米奇又打敗了喬伊﹒費雷爾
Micky knocked out Joey Ferrell.
沒錯，而且曼津疏于訓練
Exactly.
And Mungin just got off the couch.
不能測精確的體重，不過他可能比你重些
Can't make weight.
Might be a bit over, though.
- 重多少？
- 大概162還是165磅
- How over?
- Maybe 162, 165.
165磅？米奇減重了，他才146磅
One-sixty-five?
Micky dropped weight. He's 146.
盧，我們准備和曼比打的，對吧？
我們准備的是和他打
Lou, we prepared for Mamby. All right?
We prepared for Mamby.
那家伙游手好閑，而米奇正狀態良好
This guy just got off the couch.
Micky's in shape.
進行過長跑等訓練，而那家伙啥也沒練
Roadwork, everything else.
This other guy, he hasn't done dick.
別忘了，你不比賽，大家都賺不到
Don't forget, you don't fight,
nobody gets paid.
好
OK.
盧，拜托
So, Lou... Come on, please.
米奇…喬伊﹒費雷爾打敗過他
Mick...
Joey Ferrell knocked him out.
會是場殘酷對決，對吧？
Gonna be a hell of a fight, huh?
- 我不同意，165磅太重了
- 你擊敗過喬伊﹒費雷爾
- I'm not doing this. 165 is big.
- You knocked out Joey Ferrell.
- 那又怎樣？他是中量級的
- 他疏于訓練
- So what? He's a middleweight.
- He just got off the couch.
迪奇，他比我重20磅
He's got 20 pounds on me, Dicky.
喬伊﹒費雷爾擊敗過他
你擊敗過喬伊﹒費雷爾
Joey Ferrell knocked him out,
you knocked out Joey Ferrell.
- 你已經說過了
- 對，你要無所畏懼
- You just said that.
- Yeah, right. You can't be scared.
- 害怕？
- 對
- Scared?
- Yeah.
- 那你干嘛不去和他比？
- 我會和他比的，他現在太胖了
- Why don't you go fuckin' fight him?
- I'll go fuckin' fight him. He's fat.
好，別光說不干，你光榮復出的機會來了
Good. Snap out the teeth.
This is your big comeback, right?
- 那才是愛麗絲想要的
- 你打敗過喬伊﹒費雷爾
- That's what Alice wants.
- You knocked out Joey Ferrell.
好，我打敗過喬伊﹒費雷爾
好，但他是中量級選手
All right. I knocked out Joey Ferrell,
OK? But the guy is a middleweight.
我是次中量級的
他們干嗎不直接找他媽的重量級的來打？
I'm a welterweight. They didn't have
a fuckin' heavyweight to throw in there?
告訴他，迪奇，他能做到的，對吧？
他無所不能
Tell him, Dicky. He can do it, right?
He can do anything.
好，愛麗絲，沒問題
Oh, yeah, Alice. No problem.
你現在可是在一邊旁觀了，兄弟
You watch from the outside, pal.
女士們先生們
有請“機關槍”邁克﹒曼津
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mike "Machine Gun" Mungin!
沃德對曼津
亞特蘭大市國際賭場飯店
該死
Holy shit.
嘿，看，那是舒格﹒雷﹒倫納德
Hey, hey, look.
That's Sugar Ray Leonard.
嘿，雷，雷
Hey, Ray. Ray, Ray, Ray.
- 嘿，雷！舒格﹒雷！這里！
- 迪奇
- Hey, Ray! Sugar Ray! Over here!
- Dicky.
看看那家伙的塊頭
Come on, look at the size of that guy.
- 靠
- 是，靠啊
- Holy shit.
- Yeah, holy shit.
那家伙肯定不是次中量級的
That guy's no welterweight.
好了，米奇，我們要開始第一局了，拖垮他
All right, Mick. We'll have to run
the first few rounds, tire him out.
他肯定沒有疏于訓練
He did not just get off
the fuckin' couch.
他如果是，那我也要買個那樣的訓練設備
If he did,
I'm gonna buy a couch like that.
我不在乎那家伙是誰
I don't care who that guy is...
看著我，你是米奇﹒沃德
Look at me.
You're Micky Ward.
你是米奇﹒沃德
You're Micky Ward.
第二回合
米奇﹒沃德，對陣
最后一刻頂替上場的費城拳手
Micky Ward, fighting a last-minute
replacement from Philadelphia.
沃德，被比他強壯得多的選手
打得無招架之力！
Ward, thrown around
by a much bigger man!
- 几記重拳猛攻沃德
- 刺拳！
- Punches, smashing Ward back!
- Jab!
現在是大塊頭邁克…
Now it's big Mike...
沃德倒地了！沃德倒地了！
Ward goes down! Ward goes down!
起來！起來！四！五！
- Come on! Come on!
...four, five...
六
...six...
米奇﹒沃德真差勁！快滾出這場子！
Micky Ward's a fuckin' bum!
Get rid of this dude!
- 閉嘴！
- 操你媽！
- Shut up!
- Motherfucker!
曼津甚至不知道他今天要比賽
Mungin didn't even
know he'd be fighting today.
嘿，你，退后！
Hey, you, back off!
上啊！不，不，米奇！
Come on! No, no, no, Mick!
沃德是一位令人尊敬的拳擊手
Ward, a respected fighter.
希望這場級別失衡的比賽
不會打擊到他的自信
You hope this mismatch
doesn't hurt his confidence.
- 你個廢物！
- 廢物！
- You're a loser!
- You're a loser!
女士們先生們
Ladies and gentlemen,
在我們開始之前，很多人問我們
before we get started,
a lot of people have been asking
11月4號的拳擊界榮耀之夜
about the big night
of boxing on November 4.
三場重要的世界級冠軍賽
Three world championship bouts...
雷！嘿，雷！
Ray! Hey, Ray! Ray!
- 嘿
- 迪奇，你過得怎樣？
- Hey!
- Dicky. How you doin', man?
- 你呢？
- 還好
- How are ya?
- All right, man.
他重165磅，ESPN騙慘我們了
He's 165 pounds.
ESPN screwed us. You know?
- 那家伙塊頭是很大
- 嘿，我…
- The guy was huge.
- Hey. You know, I...
我打倒了雷
I knocked Ray down.
雖然我看起來很差勁，但我打敗過雷
I look like shit,
but I knocked Ray down.
讓我請你們喝酒吧，好吧？
Hey, let me buy
you guys a drink. All right?
- 要冰的？
- 不，不
- Want a cold one?
- No, no, no.
我得走了，我得趕飛機，下次吧
I got to leave. I got a plane to catch.
Next time, right?
嘿，雷，等下
HBO正給我拍電影，你知道嗎？
Hey, Ray, wait, wait. HBO's makin'
a movie on me. You know?
我能給你打電話嗎？
Can I call ya?
我馬上要比賽了
看在老交情的份上，我希望你去看
I'm gonna get a fight, and I just like
ya to be there for old time's sakes.
- 你可以解說什么的
- 關于什么的電影？
- You commentate or something.
- What's the movie about?
我的復出
My comeback. Right?
- 給我打電話，愛你，兄弟
- 我會的
- Call me. Love you, brother.
- I'll call ya.
老交情了！
You don't be a stranger!
他問得太搞笑了“電影的主題是什么？”
He's funny,
"What's the movie about?"
那是怎么了？
What's that?
你能做得更好
你是個優秀拳擊手，我一直看著你
You can do better. You're too
good a boxer, I've watched you.
- 你要去醫院嗎？
- 怎么回事？
- Are you going to the hospital?
- What is that?
- 他們說我要去縫几針
- 米奇，沒人比你更努力
- They said I need to get stitches.
- Mick, nobody's got heart like you.
你是個非常有天分的拳擊手
但你選錯了對手
You're a very talented fighter,
but you're not getting the right fights.
- 這扼殺了你的機會
- 他和邁克﹒托馬說什么？
- It's killing your chances.
- What's he talking to Mike Toma for?
- 我不知道
- 我想給你一次真正的機會
- I don't know, Dick.
- I want to give you a real shot.
我想讓你跟著我
我會出錢讓你和我的人一起訓練
I want you to come with me.
I want to pay you to train with my guys.
- 哪里？
- 拉斯維加斯
- Where?
- Las Vegas.
現在還為時未晚，做出正確的決定
再最后搏一把
Do it right and make one last run
at this thing before it's too late.
我哥哥呢？
What about my brother?
恕我直言，他是個麻煩
With all due respect,
he's too much trouble.
你最好自己決定來維加斯
You owe it to yourself
to come to Vegas.
想想，米奇，迪奇對你做了什么？
Come on, Mick,
what has Dicky done for you?
他讓你去比賽，讓你像今晚一樣被打敗
He got you into fights, he lets
you get beat, like you did tonight.
你明白的
你根本不應該參加那種比賽，差18磅
You shouldn't have been in that fight.
Eighteen pounds, think of it that way.
你本該放棄這場比賽的
You should've given it up.
安分在車里坐著，行了吧，你
Sit down in the car there.
Come on, you.
- 該死的坐著別動
- 再給媽媽來點舒格蘭威士忌
- Sit the hell down.
- A little more Scotch for Mama.
給你，慢慢喝，爭取安全到家
There you go. Nice and easy.
Don't hurt yourself coming back.
- 好嗎，老婆子？
- 天吶
- Will ya, ya old broad ya?
- Oh, my God.
噢，天啊，那個舒格﹒雷
他是個美男子，是吧？
Oh, my God, that Sugar Ray,
he's a beautiful man, isn't he?
他沒有馬上認出我
He didn't recognize me
straight away.
你看到他盯著我看的樣子了嗎？
You seen the way
he was looking at me?
他是個好人，我喜歡他
He's a good guy.
I like him, I like him.
我在拳擊場看見他的
他很高興看見我和米奇一起
I seen him on ringside, he was
so happy seeing me and Mick together.
他家庭觀很重
喜歡看見一家人緊緊團結在一起
He's all about family, that guy.
Loves to see a family stick together.
米奇，邁克﹒托馬昨晚找你干嘛？
Mick, what'd Mike Toma
want with you last night?
- 他想在維加斯訓練我
- 什么？
- He wants to train me in Vegas.
- What?
你不能相信那家伙，米奇
他不是家人，明白嗎？
You can't trust that guy, Micky.
He ain't family, you know?
你又不了解他，他有說到我嗎？
他說我可以去嗎？
You don't know him. He say anything
about me? Did he say I could come?
他沒有提到你
He didn't mention you.
沒了你哥哥，你去維加斯干嘛？
What are you gonna do in Vegas
without your brother?
那家伙就是想利用你，像廁紙一樣用完就扔
That guy just wants to use you
like a piece of toilet paper.
迪奇不在，家人不在，你去維加斯做什么？
What are you gonna do in Vegas
without Dicky? Without your family?
- 我明白，我跟他這么說了
- 你真跟他這么說了？
- I know, that's what I told him.
- You told him that, right?
真的，我跟他這么說了
我說我要和我家人一起住在洛厄爾
Yeah, I told him. I said that I needed
to be with my family in Lowell.
說得好，一點沒錯
That's right.
Nothing wrong with that.
舒格﹒雷讓我們打電話給他
我們要打給他，甜心
Sugar Ray said call him.
We're gonna call him, baby.
沒錯
That's right.
你們倆可以對練一會兒，對吧？
You guys can spar a little, right?
他們在哪？
Where are they?
- 我的冠軍寶貝！
- 老爸回來了！
- There's my champ!
- Daddy's home!
- 老爸回來了！老爸回來了！
- 熊抱下
- Daddy's home! Daddy's home!
- Give him a big hug.
我愛你！
I love you!
謝謝
Thank you.
你臉疼嗎，寶貝？
Your face hurting you, sweetheart?
還好？ 我很心疼
No? 'Cause it's killing me.
Come on.
米奇叔叔贏了嗎？
Did Uncle Micky win the fight?
不，米奇叔叔這次還沒贏
No, Micky didn't win this time.
Not this time.
嘿，米奇，保重，我明天再聯系你
Hey, Mick, you take care.
I'll call you tomorrow.
振作起來，我們會再給你安排比賽的
Cheer up. We'll get you another fight.
我心里很亂，媽，我不想再比賽了
I don't know, Ma. I don't
think I wanna do this no more.
什么叫不想比了？
What don't you wanna do no more?
就是不愿再干這個了
Just, I don't wanna do it anymore.
- 你說什么？
- 嘿，米奇，ESPN耍了我們
- What are you?
- Hey, Mick, ESPN screwed us.
他們欠我們的
我們還會有比賽的，你會痊愈的
All right? They owe us. We'll get
another fight. You'll heal up.
- 一切都會好起來的
- 對，聽你哥哥的
- It's gonna be OK.
- Yeah, listen to your brother.
他們欠我們太多了，親愛的
They owe us big-time, sweetheart.
也許他們還會拍迪奇的復出賽
Maybe they'll even
do Dicky's comeback fight.
你說呢？
What do you think?
噢，振作點，回家洗個澡放松一下
Oh, come on, cheer up. You take
a little soak when you get home,
花一兩天時間好好想想
我會幫你找更好的比賽
have a day or two to think about it.
I'll find you a better fight.
好得多的比賽，我會再找他們談
A much better fight.
I'm gonna talk to them.
- 看在上帝份上，愛麗絲
- 怎么了？
- For Chrissakes, Alice.
- What?
他輸了比賽很難過，讓他一個人靜靜
He's been through the ringer.
Leave him alone, will ya?
你在說些什么呢？
What are you talking about?
讓他一個人待會，他才剛打完比賽
Let him get some time to himself.
He just got finished.
- 你有病吧？
- 想想吧
- What's your fuckin' problem?
- Come on.
米奇在哪？他不進來嗎？
Where's Micky?
Is Micky not gonna come in?
是的，他不進來了，他得回去好好休息
No, he's not coming in.
He needs to get back and get some rest.
我們先進屋吧
Come on, let's go inside.
不，他應該休息，他太暴躁了
No. He's gonna go rest.
He's all grumpy.
我認為他受到了打擊，而且覺得很尷尬
He's beat up,
he's a little embarrassed, I think.
看看他，你看到他了？
Look at him.
Have you even seen him?
誰？
Who is it?
我看見你掀窗帘了
I saw the shade move.
米奇，窗帘還在動
Micky, the shade is still moving.
我看見你走近窗戶了，我知道你在家
I saw you come to the window,
I know you're in there.
再怎么說你也要開門，當面給我解釋清楚
Least you can do is open up
this door and tell me to my face
昨天為什么不給我打電話
why you didn't call me yesterday.
昨晚為什么放我鴿子？
Why'd you stand me up last night?
我想打的 但我不能…
I started to call. I was gonna call,
but... I just couldn't.
因為你輸了比賽？
'Cause you lost the fight?
也許吧，因為我輸了比賽
Maybe, yeah.
'Cause I lost the fight.
你怎么知道我家地址的？
How'd you know my house, anyway?
我問我哥了
I asked my brother.
你的紗布掉了
Your thing's coming off.
是另一邊
I mean your other thing.
有膠布嗎？
You got any tape?
是那個猶太黑人把你打成這樣的嗎？
Did the black Jewish guy
do this to you?
我沒能和他打
I didn't get to fight
the black Jewish guy.
你沒能運用你的“頭，身體，頭”戰朮？
You didn't get to go
head, body, head?
曼比患了流感，代他上場的人比我重20磅
Saoul Mamby got the flu. Guy who
took his place had 20 pounds on me.
我就不該和他打
I never should've fought him.
- 為什么改變主意？
- 不打沒有錢拿
- Why did you?
- Nobody would've got paid.
大家都說我可以擊敗他
Everybody said I could've beat him.
大家指誰？
Who's everybody?
我媽，我哥
My mother, my brother.
你還准備和我一起吃晚飯看電影嗎？
So are you gonna take me
to dinner and a movie, or what?
- 嘿
- 嘿
- Hey.
- Hey.
- 你真漂亮
- 謝謝
- You look great.
- Thank you.
你家真精致
Got a nice house, too.
只是個公寓，住了五人
It's an apartment building.
There's five of 'em in there.
我以前的一個室友和我住一起
One of my old roommates lives in one.
室友？你當過兵？
Roommate?
What, were you in the Army?
- 大學
- 大學，哇
- College.
- College. Wow.
什么都沒學到，我在酒吧工作
Yeah, a lot of good it did me.
I work in a bar.
你貌似很喜歡你的工作，在那很受歡迎
Well, you seem to enjoy it.
You're very popular down there.
受歡迎，我還想離開那里
Yeah, popular.
I gotta get out of there.
我上班如果沒酒喝，還不如自殺
If I don't drink while I'm working,
I'll fuckin' kill myself.
- 你讀哪所大學？
- 羅得島大學，獲得過體育全額獎
- What college?
- URI. Full boat.
那是獎學金，對嗎？
Full boat's a scholarship, right?
- 對
- 獎勵什么？
- Yeah.
- For what?
- 我曾經是跳高運動員
- 跳高？你沒開玩笑吧
- I was a high jumper.
- High jumper? You gotta be kidding me.
去你的，我很厲害，是新英格蘭冠軍
我的記錄是5英尺8英寸
Fuck you. I was good. I was
New England champ. I cleared 5' 8".

你常來這個劇院嗎？
You come to this theater a lot?
嗯，這里很不錯，電影也很棒
Yeah, it's a good theater.
They got good movies here.

我認為是《美好臉蛋》
是“臉蛋”，《美好臉蛋》
I think it's Belle Epic.
It's "epic." Belle Epic.
是《美好年代》（1992）
紐約時報很鐘愛的片子
Belle Epoque.
The New York Times loved it.
我從來沒聽過
Well, I never heard of it.
你從哪知道的？紐約時報？
Where'd you hear about it?
The New York Times?
不，同事告訴我的
No, a guy from work.
影片的拍攝技朮應該很棒
And the cinematography
is supposed to be gorgeous.
酷
Oh, cool.
謝謝
Thank you.
那就是你想看的電影？
That's the movie you wanted to see?
連性都沒有涉及
There wasn't even any good sex in it.
還他媽的不得不看字幕理解，該死的字幕
Had to read the whole fuckin' movie.
Fuckin' subtitled.
修路的同事給你推荐的這個？
And some guy from a road crew
recommended it to you?
帶字幕的電影？
A fuckin' subtitled movie?
怎么了？
What's going on?
怎么了？你已經有女朋友了？你瞞著我？
What's going on? You got a girlfriend
or something? You hiding me from her?
我真沒女朋友
I don't have a girlfriend, all right?
我喜歡你
I... I like you.
我帶你來這
因為我不想讓洛厄爾的人認出我
I came here 'cause I don't
wanna show my face in Lowell.
我跟所有人都說能贏那場比賽，重振雄風
I told everybody I was gonna win
that fight and get back on track.
我跟我女兒說我要買一套大點的公寓
她就能搬進來
I told my daughter I was gonna get
a bigger apartment so she can move in.
你真以為我不想給你打電話嗎？
You don't think I wanted to call you?
我覺得很丟臉，我受夠了總讓別人失望
I was embarrassed. I mean... I'm sick
of being a fuckin' disappointment. I...
你真覺得你家人為你考慮了嗎？
You really think
your family's looking out for you?
別那樣說我家人
Don't say that about my family.
聽了你告訴我的，我還能說什么？
What else can I say
after what you told me?
看看你的臉
I mean, look at your face.
看看你現在的樣子
Look at you.
狗屁，盧，你不糾正這事我就一直打你電話
Bullshit, Lou. I'm not gonna
stop callin' till you make this right
還有幫我們找場公平的比賽
and give us a fight that's fair.
我兒子上次差點被打死
My boy could've got killed last time.
你有什么新消息？
Yeah, like what?
別又告訴我那人疏于訓練
Just don't tell me he just
got off the fuckin' couch.
剛輸了一場？
He's coming off a loss?
非常有意思，回頭再打給你
Sounds very interesting.
I'll get back to you.
絕好機會來了
We got a great opportunity here.
快去找米奇
We gotta go find Micky.
貌似大概三個禮拜沒人看到他了
Nobody's seen him
for like three weeks.
天吶
Jesus.
以前只是找不到迪奇
現在他們兄弟倆都找不到了？
Used to be Dicky we couldn't find,
now it's both of them?
媽，我猜他是和那個酒吧女郎在一起
Ma, I think he's
with that girl from the bar.
- 什么女的？
- 就是那個娘們，沙琳
- What girl?
- It's that fuckin' girl, Charlene.
那就是和他在一起的那個酒吧女郎
That's who he's with.
That girl from the bar.
喬治正迫不及待地撮合他倆呢
George was all fuckin' eager
for them to get together.
據說她喜歡3P
I heard she's into three-ways.
- 沒錯，和其他女孩一起
- 對，她很像一個MTV女郎
- Yeah, with other girls.
- Yeah, like one of those MTV girls.
MTV女郎是什么意思？
MTV...
What are you talking about?
很狂
Wild.
覺得她念過大學就高人一等
She acts all fuckin' superior
'cause she went to college.
你們趕緊去把米奇找回來
You girls just go
find your brother, Micky.
告訴他我們有很重要的事和他商量
Tell him we've got important
business to discuss.
我得去找迪奇
I've gotta go find Dicky.
迪奇！
Dicky!
嘿，媽，那里什么事都沒發生，我只是…
Hey, Ma, there's nothing
in there. I just...
只是見些朋友
It was just some friends I was seeing,
you know?
別擔心，媽媽
Don't worry about it, Ma.
我只是在幫他們
I was just helping 'em out, you know?
嘿，愛麗絲…
Hey, Alice...
愛麗絲…
Alice...
我開了個玩笑
I started a joke
 卻使全世界泣不成聲
Which started the whole world cryin'
如果我早明白
Oh, if only I'd seen
我才是被嘲笑的那個人
That the joke was on me
 我開始哭泣
I started to cry
 卻使全世界放聲大笑
Which started
the whole world laughin'
 如果我早明白
Oh, if only I'd seen
我才是被嘲笑的那個人
That the joke was on me
我仰望天空
I looked at the skies
雙手在眼前舞動
Runnin'my hands over my eyes
從床上跌落
And I fell out of bed
傷到了頭
Hurting my head...
你是海狸，你是紅熊
So you're Beaver
and you're Red Bear.
- 紅胡子
- 她是紅狗，那才是海狸
- Red Beard.
- She's Red Dog, and that's Beaver.
你是紅狗，你是海狸
You're Red Dog. You're Beaver.
- 不要這樣叫我們
- 只有家人才能
- Yeah, don't use those names.
- It's just for family.
禮貌點
Be nice.
別叫綽號
Don't use the nicknames.
我不認為我是真把他們當動物叫的
I don't think
I'll fuckin' call 'em anything.
說到家人…
Speaking of family...
你好
Hello.
- 愛麗絲，這是沙琳
- 你好
- Alice, this is Charlene.
- Hi.
我聽到很多關于你的消息
I've heard a lot about you.
是嗎？我也聽到很多關于你的消息
Really? I've heard
a lot about you, too.
- 那是什么意思？
- 和你一樣的意思
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Same thing you meant.
我們能坐下來商量一下正事嗎？
Can we just sit down
and talk about business?
我又幫你聯系了一場比賽，米奇
就像我承諾過的
I got you another fight, Mick.
Just like I said I would.
盧﹒勾爾德和ESPN談好了
Lou Gold and ESPN made it right.
就像我跟你說的，喬﹒貝林
六周后，康州快活大賭場
Just like I told you. Joe Belinc.
Six weeks. The Foxwoods.
那小子大概只有118磅，無足輕重
Kid's like, you know,
ten and eight, he's nothin'.
而且他們會付我們兩萬酬金
You know? And they're
gonna pay us 20 grand.
- 17500美元，迪克
- 17500美元
- Seventeen-five, Dick.
- Seventeen-five.
還是很大一筆收入，米奇
Which is still... good money, Mick.
嗯
Yeah.
嗯，是不錯，迪克，我只是
Yeah, that's good, Dick. I'm just,
想弄清楚最適合我發展的道路
you know, trying to figure out
what's best for me.
比如？
Like what?
什么最適合你，親愛的？
What's best for you, sweetheart?
米奇，我原以為你會更興奮的
Come on, Mick, I thought
you'd be more excited.
你為什么顯得興味索然呢？
公平的比賽，丰厚的收入
Why ain't you more excited?
It's a good fight, good money.
我對盧的態度很強硬，告訴他他欠我們的
I got tough with Lou Gold.
Told him he owes us.
我知道，媽，只是我不想再像從前那樣
Yeah, I know, Ma. I don't want things
going the way they've been going.
米奇，上次那場，不公平，一點都不公平
Mick, that last fight,
it was unfair. That was unfair.
- 我們不會再重蹈覆轍了
- 這輩子都不會了
- And we ain't gonna repeat that. Right?
- No, not on your life.
但上拳擊台的只有你
No, but...
It's just you in the ring.
我知道是我在拳台上打
Yeah, I know it's me in the ring.
但我不喜歡現在的運作方式
But I don't like the way things
have been going here.
- 哪里？
- 這里，拳擊，我們一家，洛厄爾
- Where?
- Here. This. Us. Lowell.
全部的慣例
The whole routine.
- 喬治，你別插手
- 都是你在說
- George, stay out of it.
- You're doing all the talking.
讓他說，你們聽著
Let him talk. Listen.
- 我在問他
- 你只是在頤指氣使
- I'm askin' him.
- You're tellin' him.
- 聽著
- 別管
- Listen.
- Stay out of it.
別這么跟我說話
Don't tell me to stay out of it.
米奇，你有什么問題？
Mick, what's the problem?
- 很多問題
- 比如？
- The problems.
- What problems?
- 問題…
- 到底是什么？
- Problems...
- Like what?
比如你在訓練時不按時出現
Like, maybe you not
showing up on time to train.
也許是他不得不去可卡因屋找你
Like maybe him having to come
find you in a crack house
當你該去機場的時候
when you're supposed
to be at the airport.
對不起，我不知道你是誰
有什么資格這樣說
I'm sorry. I don't know who
you are, or why you're talking.
我是沙琳，剛見過
I'm Charlene. We just met.
我們明明在一起，還需要我再介紹一遍嗎？
你好，我是沙琳
We're together. Do we need
to do this again? Hi, I'm Charlene.
你好，我是沙琳
Hi, I'm Charlene.
你好，我是沙琳
Hi, I'm Charlene.
嘿，我們在一起！
Hey, we're together!
你會怎么做，米奇？
聽某些在酒吧工作的MTV女郎的話？
What are you gonna do, Mick? Listen
to some MTV girl who works in a bar?
關于拳擊她懂什么？
What's she know about boxing?
我知道去維加斯接受全年帶薪訓練
I know that going to Vegas
and gettin' paid to train year-round
聽起來比你讓他做的好十萬八千里
sounds a hell of a lot better
than what you got him doing here.
你就這樣讓她和你媽說話？
You gonna let her talk
like that to your mother?
說話啊，米奇
Come on, Micky.
我說過了，我倆在一起
這是我女朋友，我希望她在這里
I told you, we're together.
This is my girlfriend. I want her here.
我做了一切所有我能為你做的，米奇
I have done everything...
everything I could for you, Micky.
- 這個MTV女郎來了后
- 別再那么叫我
- This MTV girl comes along...
- Stop calling me an MTV girl,
不管那是什么意思
whatever the fuck that means.
- 粗俗下流
- 很狂
- Skank.
- It's wild.
我干這行已經十五年多了
而她一來就頂撞我
I've been doing this over 15 years.
She comes in, disrespects me.
她不想這樣的，知道嗎？
She don't mean no disrespect, OK?
之前我有全年帶薪訓練的機會，是全年
I had a chance to get paid to train
year-round, year-round, OK?
她只是說這事而已
That's all she's talking about.
我希望你們能理解這對我意味著什么
I would hope that you guys
could appreciate that.
我明白你的意思
我曾經也可能有過這種機會
I know what you're talking about.
All right? I could've had that.
知道嗎？我當時也有像你這樣的機會
You know? I had... I had opportunities,
like maybe you're gonna have.
現在，你接受全年訓練需要錢？對嗎？
Now... You want money
so you can train year-round? Yeah?
我會給你錢，這樣你就能全年訓練了
I'll get you money
so you can train year-round.
- 你？怎么做？
- 我來搞定，相信我
- You? How?
- Yeah, I'll do it. Trust me.
相信我，好嗎？這事先到這
Hey, trust me. All right? Done.
好嗎？沙琳？好嗎？大家？
All right? Charlene? Yeah? Everyone?
如果你投入200美元
So, you put in $200, right?
然后你讓另外10個人每人投入200美元
Then you get ten other people
to put in 200...
這樣你就有2000美元了
...and you got your 2,000.
- 每個人都給你200美元？
- 不是，不是每個人，十個就夠了
- Everybody give you $200?
- No, not everybody, just ten of you.
10個幸運的人
Ten lucky ones.
你是在敲詐我們
You rip us off.
不，我是在給你機會
No, no, I'm giving you an opportunity.
你給我200美元
You give me $200.
不，是你給其他10個人提供機會
從他們那里拿錢
No, you get that from ten other people
who you offer the opportunity to.
對吧？你懂了嗎？不懂？
Right? You understand? No?
他認為你把柬埔寨人都當傻子
He thinks you think
Cambodian people are stupid.
我愛柬埔寨人民，看看凱倫
I love Cambodian people.
I mean, look at Karen.
她是我女朋友，她美極了，我愛她
She's my girlfriend.
She's beautiful. I love her.
布萊恩，我們一起在修路隊工作
You know, and Brian.
We work on a road crew together.
- 最近沒有經常在一起
- 我們一起在修路隊工作
- Well, not so much lately.
- We work on a road crew together.
我只是說，你一直沒出現
You haven't been showing up,
that's all I'm saying.
這不是和柬埔寨人敵對
This ain't an anti-Cambodian thing.
白種人之間也這樣交流
White people do this
to other white people.
- 這是世界運行的規律
- 布布，你那么說沒用
- It's what makes the world go round.
- Boo Boo, I don't think that's helping.
這是一生僅有一次的機會
I mean, this is...
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
他們根本不懂
I mean, they didn't understand.
他們本來可以稱之為我的弟兄
You know, I mean,
they're practically my gang.
一般他們都會聽我說的
但這次他們就是不理解
Usually, they listen to what I say,
but they just didn't understand
我給他們提供的這個好機會
the opportunity, you know,
I was offering them.
- 我們說到哪了？
- 在你和舒格﹒雷比賽之前
- What were we talking about?
- Before you fought Sugar Ray.
對，對，舒格﹒雷
當時體格和速度上都比我強
Right, right, right. I mean,
Sugar Ray was too much too soon.
我需要鍛煉體格慢慢趕上
You know, I needed to build up slow.
You know, right?
這部電影的主題是什么？
What's this movie about, again?
我告訴過你，是關于毒癮
I told you,
it's about crack addiction.
用紀實手法反映，孩子們會更加警醒
Showing what it really is
so kids can see it for real.
靠
Fuck.
我要去給米奇弄錢了
We gotta get Mick's money.

我再也不想幫你圓謊了
I'm fuckin' done lyin' for you.
沒有我你能干什么？

事情不是那樣的！
This isn't how it was meant to go down!

我不干了，行嗎？我不做拳擊手了

I'm done fightin'.
再也不需要了

因為你就讓他們奪走你的夢想
真是太悲哀了
Because it's sad that you
let them take it away from you
還是用他們愚蠢的方式

沙琳，我還能怎么做？
What else can I do, Charlene?
你有很多能做的，米奇
There's a lot you can do, Micky.
你爸爸希望你去見一個人
There's this guy that

別用電視看那個屁片子，別看
Don't go watch
that crazy shit on TV, don't!
好萊塢！
Hollywood!
你們看看！看看！
Get a look! Get a look, all right!
進軍好萊塢！進軍好萊塢！
Going to Hollywood!
Going to Hollywood, yeah!
好了！
All right!
好了，把電視打開！
All right, get this started!
HBO原創記錄片
洛厄爾孕育了美國工業革命
Lowell was the birthplace of
the Industrial Revolution in America.
工業革命…，洛厄爾
Industrial Revolution... Lowell.
美國吸毒現象
我曾經住在那里
這鎮子給人美好的回憶，對吧？
I used to live over there.
This town got good memories, right?
- 看看吧
- 靠，沒錯
- Check it out.
- Fuck, yeah.
- 這里的那棟白色房子？
- 對
- This house here, this white house?
- Oh, yeah.
那棟很大的白房子
我第一次就是在這吸的可卡因
White, big fat guy.
First time I got my crack, over here.
你知道他們在白房子里吸毒嗎？
Did you ever know that?
They smoke crack at the White House?
白種人，黑種人，波多黎各人
各式各樣
White, black, Puerto Rican, everything.
我第一次吸毒是大概23歲左右
The first time I did crack, or whatever,
I was about 23
一個朋友給了我一克左右
and a friend of mine gave me
a gram, or whatever.
真希望這沒有發生
Fuck, I wish that'd never happened.
在那之前，我一直參加
銀手套少年拳擊賽和別的比賽
Before that, I'd been doing
the Silver Mittens and stuff.
我還是獨子的時候才12歲，有時會喝醉
I was the only kid.
I'd be 12... I was shit-faced.
我會告訴你可卡因是怎么讓人成癮的
I'll tell ya how crack works.
當它進入肺部，進入肺部
When it enters your lungs...
When it enters your lungs...
- 我想看爸爸
- 哦，天吶，別
- I wanna watch, Daddy.
- Oh, my God. No, sweetie.
- 上樓去
- 可是我想看爸爸上電視
- You go back upstairs.
- But I wanna watch Daddy on TV.
我知道，寶貝，但你現在不能看，好嗎？
I know, baby. You can't watch
Daddy right now, all right?
上樓去睡覺，好嗎？
You go back upstairs
and go to bed, OK?
好，那是我的兄弟，看看他們
OK, yeah, there's my boys
right there. Check 'em out.
- 那是什么蛇？蟒蛇？
- 對，看看它
- What kind of snake's that? Python?
- Yeah, check it out, man.
- 它不會咬我或是攻擊我嗎？
- 它很聽話
- It's not gonna bite me or something?
- He's cool.
逗了它一會了，我來者不拒
It's been a while.
I'll take anything right now.
我從沒想過自己會親一條蛇
I never thought
I'd kiss a fuckin' snake.
頂多做做夢
I always dreamed about it...
興奮起來淨干些傻事，對吧？
Do a lot of shit
when you're high, right?
迪奇，使洛厄爾這個小城揚名
Dicky... put Lowell on the map.
他打倒了舒格﹒雷﹒倫納德
He knocked Sugar Ray Leonard down.
對，他打敗了舒格﹒雷﹒倫納德
但我不認為那是有效擊倒
Yeah, he knocked him down,
but I don't think it was a knockdown.
- 我認為是雷滑倒了
- 他是打倒了雷
- I think he slipped.
- He knocked him down.
- 雷沒有滑倒
- 他有
- He didn't slip.
- He slipped.
- 哦，你也是洛厄爾的
- 得了吧
- Oh... and you're from Lowell.
- Yeah, come on.
- 淨他媽的胡說！
- 他們說他是癮君子
- That's a fuckin' lie!
- They said he's in trouble with drugs.
你干嗎呢？你亂說家里的事了嗎？
What is this? Are you talking
shit about the family?
-哦，沒有，沒有
- 我聽到你說“迪奇，米奇”
- Oh, no, no, no...
- I heard you say "Dicky, Micky..."
我們不是那樣的，那并不是洛厄爾的全部
We're not like that.
This is not what Lowell is all about.
我以為他會光榮復出
I thought he could make a comeback
- 讓我們驕傲，但是他沒有
- 我不知道迪奇在想什么
- and make us proud, but he didn't.
- I don't know what Dicky was thinking.
真讓人失望,惡心
Very disappointing,
very disgusting.
你讓洛厄爾倒退了30年，我們很生氣
You brought the city of
Lowell back 30 years. We're not happy.
- 你好？
- 吉米？
- Hello?
- Jimmy?
嘿，你能幫我個忙嗎？
現在別讓凱西看HBO行嗎？
Hey, will you do me a favor?
Make sure Kasie's not watching HBO?
實際上，我們現在正在看，米奇
不過別擔心
Actually, we're watching it right now,
Mick, but don't worry about it.
我會…
I got it...
我想讓她看看，讓她看看她叔叔是什么人
I want her to see it.
Let her see who her uncle is.
- 什么？
- 看清你是什么人
- What?
- Who you are.
我是什么人？你說什么呢？
Who I am?
What are you talking about?
- 孩子需要知道真相，米奇
- 勞里，關掉電視，求你了
- Kids need to know the truth, Mick.
- Laurie, turn it off, please.
她不需要看這個，她不需要
She does not need to see this.
She doesn't need to see it.
她還是個孩子
She's a kid.
當你吸食可卡因
When you smoke crack, you know...
你會飄飄欲仙
... you feel so much lighter.
你會覺得自己很年輕，進入了仙境
You know, you feel young, like when
everything was in front of you,
一切都…
everything was just...
一切都…
... everything was... just...
進入仙境了，你懂嗎？
... it was in front of you, you know?
然后
And then...
然后這種感覺消失了，你要再吸一次
... it fades and you
gotta get high again.
由于你進監獄，你在電影里的角色也終結了
Your part in the movie
is gonna end with you going to jail.
那小迪奇呢？誰會照料他？
What about little Dicky?
Who's gonna take care of him, huh?
你不能和他們說說嗎？
You guys can't talk to 'em?
哦，兄弟
Oh, man...
把這破玩意關了，把它關了
Turn this shit off.
Turn this off, all right?
關掉它，幫下忙？
Turn it off. Will you turn this off?
你不關…，那我來關
If you don't...
I'm turning it fuckin' off.
嘿，那是我的生活
Hey, hey, that is my life.
- 我的電影夜！
- 那說的是我操蛋的生活
- My movie night!
- That's my fuckin' life out there.
- 我想看，你的生活關我什么事
- 操你媽！
- I wanna watch this. I don't care.
- I will fuck you up!
你皮痒了？再惹我試試
You fuckin' want some?
Don't fuckin' try me.
我他媽有這權利，好吧？
I still fuckin' got it, OK?
你想來几拳頭？！
You fuckin' want some?!
我兒子在電視上，你卻嘲笑他？！
That's my son there,
and you're laughin' at him?!
那是我兒子，他在哭，他需要我
我卻被關在這鬼地方
That's my son. He's crying. He needs me.
And I'm fuckin' stuck in here?
但你知道嗎？迪奇曾是小混混
But you know what?
Dicky was a street kid.
米奇，你在看嗎？他們怎么能這樣對我們？
Micky, you watching this?
What are they doing to us?
媽，我不知道該怎么說
Ma, I don't know what to tell you.
你一直裝作什么都不知道
You're pretending like you
don't know what's going on.
他這個樣子已經很多年了
He's been doing this for years.
是，媽媽，我知道很糟糕，但…
Yeah, I know it's horrible, Ma, but...
- 你覺得呢？
- 他們陷害他？
- What do you think?
- You think they set him up?
你覺得他干了什么？
What do you think he was doing?
是他們給他錢，給他毒品
讓他同意拍電影，對嗎？
You know, gave him money,
gave him drugs for the movie. Right?
米奇…米奇？
Micky... Micky?
靠，米奇
Shit. Micky...
- 你換新沙袋了，是吧？
- 嗯
- You got a new bag, huh?
- Yup.
- 新支架？
- 對
- New bracket, too?
- Yup.
- 那個花生形狀的怎么了？
- 不知道
- What happened to the peanut?
- I don't know.
現在這個像個沙灘球
It's like a beach ball.
* 紅衣主教亞瑟﹒J曾經說… *
（宗教領袖）
* 林蔭大道旁不會再充滿愛和生機 *
* 如同八十年代初期，炙熱的好比地獄 *
* 再唱首歌讓我重新墜入愛河 *

- 米奇，薩爾瓦多﹒拉納羅
- 嘿，米奇，你好嗎？
- Mick. Sal Lonano.
- Hey, Mick, how you doing?
你是計程車公司的老板，經營的不錯，是嗎？
You own a cab company,
you're a good businessman, right?
- 他很精明
- 手怎么樣了？
- Yeah, he's very organized.
- How's the hand?
還不錯，感覺越來越好了，越來越有力了
It's good. You know,
it's getting better. Stronger.
我已經打了好几個電話了
我還跟巴蒂﹒泰格斯談過
Yeah, you know, I made a few calls
already. I talked to Buddy Tags.
他說可以在本地給你安排一些比賽
可以讓你重振旗鼓
Said he can set up something local,
something to start back with.
- 重拾信心
- 就是那個
- Get your confidence back.
- That's it.
你必須把你的自信找回來
這是目前最重要的
You gotta get your confidence back.
That's all.
你父親想要讓薩爾做你的經紀人
還想讓我來訓練你
Your dad wants Sal to manage ya,
and he wants me to train ya.
但有一個前提
But I'll only do it on one condition.
- 就是一定要按規矩辦
- 就是這樣
- No crazy-time nonsense.
- It's how it's gotta be.
- 迪奇和愛麗絲不參與
- 迪奇和愛麗絲不參與
- No Dicky. No Alice.
- No Dicky. No Alice.
我懂，懂了，沒關系，我明白
I get it, I get it.
I'm good, I understand.
- 我會珍惜這個機會
- 不能再胡來了，米奇
- Look, I appreciate the opportunity.
- I can't take the bullshit, Mick.
- 沒有冒犯的意思，喬治
- 沒事
- No offense, Georgie.
- None taken.
反正我會在愛麗絲那邊死得很慘
I'm gonna be the one who gets
his balls cut off, anyway.
- 嗯，你滿意了
- 你
- Yeah. You laugh.
- You...
- 你個叛徒！
- 你在干什么？
...fuckin' traitor!
- What are you doing?
你他媽的這是怎么了？！
搞什么！鍋砸的很疼！
What the hell's the matter with you?!
Come on! The pans hurt!
傷到你了？那才是我想要的！
Do they hurt?! I hope it hurts!
- 薩爾瓦多﹒拉納羅是個好人！
- 好人？！
- Sal Lonano is a good man!
- A good man?!
天吶，他是一個正當的生意人
He's a legitimate businessman,
for Chrissakes!
- 正當的生意人？
- 是，怎么？
- Legitimate businessman?
- Yes. What?
我的天，你知道那聽起來像什么嗎？
Oh, my God,
you know what that sounds like?
- 他是一個騙子，喬治！
- 他擁有一家出租車公司！
- He's a crook, George!
- He owns a taxi cab company!
- 他很精明
- 他只是個開出租車的
- He's organized!
- Oh, my God. He's a cab driver.
他很懂拳擊，好嗎？
He knows everything
about boxing, right?
鬼才那么想！
他會偷走你兒子的錢，把他洗劫一空
I don't think so! He's gonna steal
your son's money and rob him blind!
你為什么這么想？怎么會那么想呢？
Why would you think that?
Why would you even think that?
- 你為什么這么多疑？
- 我懂人性
- Why can't you trust anybody with?
- I know people.
我知道，喬治
你以為我什么都不懂，但我懂人性
I know, George, you think I don't
know anything, but I know people.
- 我知道你懂人性…
- 那個叫薩爾瓦多的長著個大鷹鉤鼻的家伙
- I know you know people.
- And that Sal Lonano
banana fucking thing,
we don't need that in our lives!
我們的生活不需要他！
我們還沒有通過這些孩子們掙到一分錢！
We haven't made one dollar
with these kids!
- 你背叛了我！
- 扯淡，我背叛了你
- You betrayed me!
- Oh, bullshit, I betrayed you.
- 你每次都那么說
- 他是一個該死的騙子！
- You always react the same way.
- He's a fuckin' crook!
米奇該怎么辦呢？迪奇還在蹲監獄呢
What's Micky supposed to do?
Dicky's in jail!
我們說的不是他的教練，親愛的
We're not talking about his trainer,
sweetheart!
我們說的是他的經紀人，就是我
We're talking about his manager,
that's me!
但，媽媽，也許米奇該嘗試些不同的東西
But, Mom, maybe Micky
should try something different!
誰准許你在我的廚房里說話了？
What are you doing opening
your mouth in my kitchen?
- 你欠我200美元
- 我說過我下星期會給你的
- You owe me $200.
- I said I was gonna pay you next week.
你給我閉嘴
I don't want
another word outta you.
上個月你就告訴我兩個星期后還我
That was last month
you told me two weeks.
你還欠我錢，就敢在我的房子里面跟我作對？
You take sides against me in
my own house, you owe me money?
媽媽對米奇一直都很好，謝里
And Ma's been great
to Micky, Sherri.
真的，對待米奇
有誰能比他自己的母親對他更好？
Really, I mean, who's gonna look out
for Micky better than his own mother?
都怪那婊子，沙琳，我們要讓他離開米奇
It's that fuckin' girl, Charlene.
We gotta get rid of her.
媽，我們要讓他離開米奇
都是她，沙琳，她該走
Ma, we gotta get rid of her.
It's that girl, Charlene. She gotta go.
你們還要把沙琳牽扯進來？
You're gonna get Charlene involved?
- 你們就在告訴我這個？
- 我知道她住哪
- Is that what you're telling me?
- I know where she lives.
你們總喜歡找她岔干嘛？
What are you pickin' on her for?
她家就是斯蒂芬斯街那棟黃色的房子
She lives in that
yellow house on Stevens Street.
我要去跟米奇談談，把事情說清楚
I'm gonna go talk to Micky,
sort this out for myself.
對，當然了，你帶著你的“積極分子”去解決
你們現在都一起走
Yeah, sure. You go handle it
with your vigilantes. All of yous now.
別這么做，愛麗絲！
This is wrong, Alice!
我來開車門
I got it!
滾開，上車！
Get outta my way! Get in the car!
快點，快點！
Come on, come on, come on, come on!
上車
Get in the car.
- 對，他們在里面！
- 就是二樓的那個房間
- Yeah, they're in there!
- Up there on the second floor.
米奇！
Micky!
你該死的在哪？在上面？快下來
Where the hell are you?
You up there? Come on down!
到底在哪？
Where are you?
靠，米奇，你媽跟你的姐妹們都來了
Holy shit, Micky, your mother
and your sisters are here.
不，不，不要出去，求你了
No, don't.
Do not go out there. Please.
我才不會逃避你那些混賬家人
No, I'm not hiding from
your crazy fuckin' family.
你們好
Hi.
哇，看看他們
Well, well, well.
Look at this.
看什么？
Look at what?
- 你為什么要躲我們，米奇？
- 他沒有躲
- Why you hiding from us, Micky?
- He's not hiding.
我沒跟你說話，我在跟我的兒子說話
Wasn't talking to you.
I was talking to my son.
你在干什么，米奇？
What are you doing, Mickster?
我就在這兒，沒有躲任何人，愛麗絲
I'm right here.
I ain't hiding from nobody, Alice.
你讓你爸卑鄙的朋友拉納羅
給你安排比賽是自毀前程
You're not helping yourself with
your father's scumbag friend Lonano.
你要怎么做？下一步扔下迪奇？
What are you gonna do,
turn your back on Dicky next?
我們一直以來都期盼你成為世界冠軍
All we ever wanted for you
was to be world champion.
米奇已經是成年人了，他可以自己思考
Micky's a grown man.
He can think for himself.
- 閉嘴
- 賤人
- Shut your mouth.
- Skank.
再這么叫我
我會把你頭上的該死的頭發扯下來
Don't call me skank. I'll rip that nasty
hair right out of your fuckin' head.
我是他的母親兼經紀人
I'm his mother. And his manager.
你已經不再是我的經紀人了
我也不會等迪奇了，好嗎？
You're not my manager anymore.
And I'm not waiting for Dicky, OK?
我也老大不小了
I'm not gettin' any younger.
親愛的，誰會照顧你呢？
Who's gonna look after you, sweetheart?
想想吧，我知道你不會明白的
但我有九個孩子
I mean, come on. I know you don't
understand it, but I had nine kids
- 而且都深深愛著你們每一個
- 你已經用很可笑的方法証明了這點
- and I love every one of you the same.
- You got a funny way of showing it,
讓他被痛扁，讓他的手受傷
letting him get beat up,
letting him get his hand broken.
- 你瘋了
- 你這該死的酒吧婊子！
- You're crazy.
- You fuckin' bar skank!
- 我剛跟你說的什么？
- 別把你的手放在她的…
- What did I just say to you?
- Don't put your hands on her...
- 放開我！
- 停！
- Get off of me!
- Stop it!
放開她！放開她！
Let her go!
Let her go!
- 操，沙琳！
- 操！
- Fuck you, Charlene!
- Fuck you!
- 你們他媽都給我滾！現在！
- 操，沙琳！
- Get the fuck outta here! Now!
- Fuck you, Charlene!
- 賤人！
- 米奇
- Skank!
- Micky...
- 該死的賤人！
- 天吶！蓋爾！
- Fuckin' bitch!
- Oh, my God! Gail!
她對你的鼻子做了什么？
What'd she do to your nose?
發生什么事了？大家怎么了？
What is happenin'?
What is happenin' to everybody?
我真不明白，親愛的
I don't understand, sweetheart.

我從來不這么說
'Cause I don't.
- 沒有E﹒米奇﹒沃德
- 嘿，按下電梯
* 因為我要奮發前行 *
- No-E Micky Ward.
- Hey, somebody push the button.
* 我無所顧忌 *
- 我們去哪？拳擊場在哪？
- 拳擊場就在街對面
- Where we going? What's with the ring?
- Ring's across the street.
* 我就從此而來，我要重回正軌 *
- 拳擊場就在街對面？
- 是
- The ring's across the street?
- Yeah.
一個小場地，那里沒有更衣室
Yeah, smaller venue.
They got no dressin' rooms over there.
- 可是…
- 這才剛剛開始，米奇，不要著急
- Yeah, but...
- Micky, It's just a start. Don't worry.

有人探望迪奇﹒埃克隆
Visit for Dick Eklund.
迪奇！
Dicky!
埃克隆，你有訪客！
Eklund, you got a visitor!
聽說你贏了好几場比賽了，米奇
干的不錯
Heard you won a bunch of fights, Mick.
That's good.
我知道你了解我在做什么
I know you know what I been doing.
愛麗絲和其他人肯定都跟你說過了
I'm sure Alice
and everybody else told you.
我只是想當面跟你說
I just wanted to tell you
to your face myself.
我請了一個新的經紀人
還有麥奇﹒奧基夫是我的教練
I got new management.
Mickey O'Keefe's my trainer now.
一切都進展的不錯
It's all good.
對，他們還幫你安排
跟阿方索﹒桑切斯打比賽了
Yeah. They got you fightin'
Alfonso Sanchez.
- HBO直播
- 你很自豪吧？
- On HBO.
- And you're proud of that?
- 太對了
- HBO一般投資墨西哥選手
- Fuckin' right.
- HBO is invested in the Mexican.
我原來想也不敢想他們會給我投資
I didn't think they were gonna be
invested in me?
- 現在我的機會來了，我要好好把握
-  醒醒吧
- I got a shot. I'm gonna take it.
- Wake up.
他們都不在乎你的生死
They don't care if he kills you.
邁克﹒托馬是幕后主使，他在利用你
把你看做是桑切斯的墊腳石
Mike Toma did it. He's using you,
like a stepping-stone for Sanchez.
- 你為什么不明白？
- 我明白
- Why don't you see?
- Oh, I see.
沒有偉大的迪奇﹒埃克隆幫我
我怎么能錯過這樣一個機會，對嗎？
How could I stand a chance without the
great Dick Eklund in my corner, right?
我當初有可能會被曼津打死
但你一點都不在乎
You didn't give a fuck
if I got killed by Mungin.
現在你又突然擔心我會被桑切斯傷到
為什么？
Now all of a sudden you're worried
Sanchez is gonna hurt me? Why?
因為你被關在這里
再也不能成為人們的焦點？
'Cause you're stuck in here and can't
be the center of attention no more?
- 你就那么想成為中心？
- 我看過這個墨西哥拳手的比賽
- You need it that bad?
- I've seen this Mexican fight.
他擊打，沖撞，像騾子一樣強壯，好嗎？
He fights, hits,
like a fuckin' mule, all right?
15場不敗戰績，你瘋了嗎？
Fifteen knockouts, undefeated.
You crazy?
還有那個開出租車的笨蛋，拉納羅？
這正是他一手策划的
And that taxi cab idiot,
Lonano, he went right for it.
他不是一般的流氓，只在利用你大撈一把
He's a paper gangster,
he's using you to steal money.
你為什么就不能把嘴閉上為我感到高興？
Why can't you just shut up
and be happy for me?
我把過去十年浪費在
你跟愛麗絲安排的垃圾比賽上
I spent the last ten years of my life
in bad fights set up by you and Alice.
現在我終于熬出頭了
I finally got a good thing going for me
為什么你他媽就不能為我感到高興？
為什么？
and you can't be fuckin'
happy for me? Why?
你的策略呢？你打算怎么跟桑切斯過招？
What's your plan?
How you gonna fight Sanchez?
- 我不打算在這討論
- 你的策略是什么？
- I ain't here to talk about that.
- What's your plan?
- 我不是來談那個
- 你的策略是什么？
- I am not here to talk about that.
- What's your plan?
你應該和我談這個
Yes, you are.
你看到比賽時就知道我的策略了
You watch the fight
and you'll see the plan.
我看不到，他們不讓我們看
拳擊比賽太暴力了
I can't watch it. They don't let us.
It's too fuckin' violent. I mean...
還有兩分鐘，迪奇
Two minutes, Dicky.
他們讓我們看一個關于毒品的愚蠢記錄片
They'll let us watch a stupid
documentary about crack,
但我卻看不到自己兄弟的比賽
but I can't watch my own
brother fighting, you know?
嘿，米奇，是什么？
Hey... Mick, what is it?
你害怕了？
還是你根本沒有計划所以你感到難堪？
You scared? You embarrassed
because you don't even have a plan?
我是你的哥哥，告訴我吧
I'm your brother. Just tell me.
無論我說什么你都不會亂評論嗎？
Are you gonna shit on it
no matter what I say?
不會亂評論，告訴我吧
I'm not gonna shit on it. Just tell me.
近戰，在中間几局用右手大擺拳
Go toe-to-toe.
Overhand right in the middle rounds.
他在防守右手大擺拳方面很弱
He's weak against the overhand right.
誰的主意？胖子奧基夫？
Who came up with that?
Fatty fuck O'Keefe?
靠，迪奇
Fuck you, Dicky.
你要跟他打拉鋸戰，直到他把體力耗光
You gotta run against this guy.
Let him punch himself out.
攻擊他的身體，貼近他
Take him to the body, right? Get inside.
不停的變換姿勢，右虛左實
Switch stances like you're gonna
work his right, hit him on the left.
你不是我，好嗎？你也成為不了我
You ain't me. All right?
You can't be me.
- 小心，在外場變換姿勢的時候…
- 你連自己的事都管不好
- Careful. Switch outside...
- You had a hard enough time
當你有機會的時候
being you when you had
your fuckin' chance,
這也是你會在這里的原因
我會用我自己的方式跟桑切斯較量的
and that's why you're in here.
I'll fight Sanchez the way I fight.
我跟你說的就是你該怎么打，你這笨蛋！
I'm talking about the way
you fight, you moron!
你們知道我是對的，他也知道我是對的
Yeah, you know I'm right!
He knows I'm right. All right.
桑切斯對沃德
托馬斯&馬克中心，拉斯維加斯
他知道我是對的
He knows I'm right.
沃德的記錄：目前29勝7敗，20次有效擊倒
Ward's record: 29 wins,
seven losses so far, 20 KOs.
他回歸這項運動后，表現有所改善
He's been a little better since
he refocused himself on the sport,
就像JB所述的那樣
as JB pointed out.
現在出場的是沃德的對手
阿方索﹒桑切斯，來自提華納，墨西哥
Now, here's Ward's opponent,
Alfonso Sanchez, out of Tijuana, Mexico.
他的戰績是：16勝，15次有效擊倒
8次首輪有效擊倒
You see the record: 16 wins,
15 KOs, eight first-round KOs.
這是麥克﹒托馬，這次比賽的承辦人
There's Mike Toma,
the promoter of the fight,
他在桑切斯身上投入了很多資金
who has a lot invested in Sanchez.
他說桑切斯是
And he says that Sanchez is
拳擊界最有潛力的天才年輕選手之一
one of the most talented young
prospects in the sport of boxing.
這真是拳擊界中最悲劇的比賽之一
This is really one of
the saddest kinds of fights in boxing.
- 別躲在角落！
- 米奇﹒沃德31歲了
- Get out of the corner!
- Micky Ward is 31 years old,
因為他需要錢，所以來到這里
他在被動挨打
he's here because he needs the money,
he's taking a beating...
我覺得他真的不能停在那里
And my point is
that he doesn't really have to sit here
一直被動挨打了，他應該主動進攻
and take this beating.
He can do something about it.
他能做什么呢？承認陷入困境直接認輸？
Which is what?
Have his corner throw in the towel?
- 還是回擊
- 退回去
- Or fight back.
- Get back.
你可以看到他的力量
You can see his power.
每次他打沃德的時候，后者都被打得向后退
Every time he hits Ward,
he backs him up.
就這么拿分太簡單了？
How about taking points away from him?
拉里，除非裁判做出指示
否則你不能上去
Larry, unless
the referee does, you can't.
裁判應該直接終止比賽
The referee should just go
ahead and stop this fight.
他知道米奇不想再比賽了，我甚至沒有做…
He knows that Micky doesn't want
to be here. I wouldn't even make...
他打的很膽小，迪克
He's fightin' scared, Dick.
只是躲開，沒有還擊
Runnin' away, not hittin' back.
哦，天啊，這樣下去他會受傷的
Oh, Jesus. He's gonna get hurt.
還是那老一套戰略
Doing that same old shit.
他們從未看過這么尷尬的表現
They never seen such
an embarrassing performance.
他在做我教他的，媽媽，他在做我教他的
He's doing what I told him, Ma.
He's doing what I told him.
別擔心，他在做我教他的
Don't worry about it.
He's doing what I told him.
米奇﹒沃德除了被挨打外什么都沒干
Micky Ward, showing nothing
but respect.
你在逃避什么？不要跑來跑去
What are you runnin' around for?
Stop running around!
他媽閉嘴，薩爾！閉嘴！
Shut the fuck up, Sal!
Shut the fuck up!
我不懂你在干嘛，米奇，想跟我談談？
I don't know what you're doing, Micky.
Want to fuckin' tell me?
因為我都不知道你在干嘛
'Cause I don't know what you're doing.
我們都已經輸了前面的5輪了
這是你想要的？
We have lost all five rounds,
is that what you want?
很可怕，太可怕了
Dreadful.
This is dreadful, dreadful stuff.
你必須趕快做點什么，米奇
不然我就要終止比賽了
You gotta show me something soon,
Mick, or I'm gonna stop the fight.
他們要終止比賽了，米奇
Now they're gonna stop the fight, Micky.
他會貼上去的，媽
He's gotta go inside, Ma.
他會攻擊對方的身體，他知道的
He's gotta take it to the body.
He's gotta.
你要把拳頭舉起來…
Come on, get your punches up...
- 不要終止比賽
- 他們要終止比賽了
- Don't stop the fight.
- They're gonna stop this fight.
你必須做點什么，親愛的
Then you gotta do something, baby.
那不是我們談過的，米奇
That's not what we talked about, Micky.
我們計划好的，但你沒有按計划做
現在上場
We had a plan and you're
not doing it. Now, let's go.
好，米奇
All right, Micky.
你已經輸掉前五輪了，下一步策略是什么？
You've lost the first five rounds.
What's the next strategy gonna be?
桑切斯的兩次右手攻擊，緊接著三記左勾拳
Double right hand by Sanchez,
then a triple left hook.
這几記左勾拳在米奇臉上留下了几道紅印
A couple of the left hooks landed
flush on the cheek of Micky Ward.
沃德試著迎上桑切斯
Ward tying Sanchez up.
沃德的表現讓人很好奇
Very curious performance
by Micky Ward.
上啊，米奇，上！
Come on, Micky, come on!
沃德似乎是想嘗試一次致命一擊
Ward seems...
trying to land one big shot
來擊倒桑切斯
to change Sanchez's mind...
桑切斯開始放手一搏了
And he's beginning to open up.
抓住更多機會靠近沃德
Taking advantage of more and more
opportunities to get close to Ward
全力去攻擊這個拳擊手…
and throw against a fighter...
時間到！
Time!
沃德不出拳來自衛
...who's not defending himself
by punching.
桑切斯可能想直接結束這場比賽了
Sanchez is gonna try
to end this fight.
- 你在干什么？上啊
- 對
- What are you doing? Come on!
- That's it.
好小子！
Good boy!
他被一記上勾拳擊倒了！
He's down on an uppercut!
- 漂亮的內側左手上勾拳
- 3，4，5
- Nicely thrown left uppercut inside.
...three, four, five...
就在在沃德剛打出一記不錯的右手攻擊之后
And right after Ward threw
a pretty good right hand.
米奇，你還好嗎？到這來，到這來
Mick, you all right?
Come to me. Come to me.
這場鬧劇該結束了
This is a fight
that should be stopped.
上啊，用“頭，身體，頭”戰朮
Come on, head, body, head.
這不是職業賽
This is not professional.
說的一點沒錯
That's exactly what I'm saying.
- 打他！ 打他！
- 我來看真得有人給我錢
- Punch him! You gotta punch!
- Someone should pay me to watch this.
上，兄弟！頭，身體，頭！
Come on, man! Head, body, head!
沃德打出漂亮的腹部一擊
That was a good body shot by Ward.
打得不錯，也許他要扭轉局勢了
That was good.
Maybe it'll turn him around.
也許，我說的是如果我…
Maybe. I'm talking about if I...
桑切斯像遭受了槍擊，倒在了地上！
哦，天吶！
Sanchez drops
like he's shot! Oh, my God!
前所未有不可思議的致勝擊倒
The most unlikely
knockout you have ever seen.
這拳擊中了腎臟，這種攻擊腎臟的拳
That was a kidney shot,
the kind of kidney shot...
9，10！
...nine, ten!
剛剛看到的還是讓我難以置信
I still don't believe
what I just saw.
哦，米奇贏了！
Oh, Micky won!
現在，難道米奇耍了我們？
Now, did Micky Ward
just make idiots of us all
用驚人的戰朮？看看回放，太精彩了
with a spectacular piece of strategy?
Take another look. Amazing.
這是來自馬塞諸塞州洛厄爾的米奇﹒沃德
職業生涯中的重大勝利 
A brilliant win in the career
of Micky Ward out of Lowell, Mass.
米奇用難以置信的擊敗手法
Unbelievable defeat
at the hands of Micky Ward,
在白白讓出回合前六局后
who had all but given away the first
half-dozen rounds of the bout.
我認為米奇做的是意識到了
I think what Micky did was he recognized
他可以通過身體一擊給對手致命傷害
that he'd hurt the guy
with the body shot.
米奇采用的戰朮比和對手硬碰硬好得多
Micky's a better fighter than that to
not be runnin' from that guy like that.
充滿未知的舞台
Theater of the unexpected.
嘿，你永遠猜不到會發生什么，對吧？
Hey, you never know
what can happen, right?
永不言棄，對吧？永不言棄
Never give up in this game, right?
Never give up.
你們不能講和，大家得明白
You can't make it up, folks.
你聽到他說的了？
You hear what he said?
他說“你不能在比賽中放棄”
He said, "You can't give up
in this game."
也許米奇﹒沃德聽到我說他應該終止比賽
Well, maybe Micky Ward
heard me say you should stop this fight
然后他就直接發力終止了
and he went out and stopped it.
- 那邊，那邊
- 對！我還是不能相信
- Right there. Right there.
- Yeah! I can't believe it.
我環顧周圍，我覺得跟他們想的一樣
I'm lookin' over, and I'm thinkin'
to myself like they were thinkin':
這場比賽玩完了
This thing is over.
但你知道嗎，如果看看評論員
But I tell you what, if you
looked at the commentators,
他還沒被判輸，他們就開始把耳機摘掉了
they started to take their headsets off
before he was even counted out.
他們都想從直播室出去了
They just wanted to get out of there.
米奇，米奇，我剛剛和邁克﹒托馬談了
Mick, Mick.
I just spoke to Mike Toma.
- 他說了件非常有意思的事
- 靠，是什么？
- He told me something very interesting.
- Holy shit, what?
他告訴我
He just told me,
如果桑切斯今晚贏了
他就可以參加頭銜賽了
had Sanchez won tonight,
he would've gotten the title shot.
- 天吶，那太好了
- 為什么？為什么會那么好？
- Holy Christ, that's beautiful.
- Why? Why is that beautiful?
- 頭銜賽，米奇可以參加頭銜賽了
- 米奇可以參加頭銜賽了！
- A title shot. Mick gets the shot.
- Micky gets the shot!
- 你不是在開玩笑？
- 確定嗎？
- Are you kidding me?
- Are you sure about that?
我剛和那家伙聊過，邁克！
到這來，告訴這些人
I just spoke to the guy. Mike!
Come here, Mike. Look, tell these guys.
- 嘿，邁克﹒托馬，謝謝
- 祝賀你
- Hey, Mike Toma. Thank you.
- Congratulations.
你再也不是墊腳石了
我一直都知道你有天賦
You're not a stepping stone anymore.
I always knew you had the talent.
戰朮真他媽絕了！
消耗他的體力，然后給他身體致勝一擊
That was a hell of a strategy, wearing
him down and taking it to the body.
干這行30年，我從沒見過那樣的致勝擊倒
Thirty years in the business,
I'd never seen a knockout like that.
拉里﹒ 默切特正在給你寫訃告呢
Larry Merchant was writing
your obituary,
然后桑切斯就像中槍似的倒下了
and Sanchez drops
like he's shot with a gun.
你怎么想到的？
Where'd you get that?
那是我哥哥教我的第一件事
That's the first thing
my brother taught me.
頭部輕擊，把致命一擊留給身體
Tap 'em to the head,
ding 'em to the body.
- 真是出色的身體一擊
- 謝謝
- That's a hell of a body shot.
- Thank you.
- 你准備好要參加頭銜賽了嗎？
- 我現在感覺又年輕了！
- You ready for a title shot?
- I ain't gettin' no younger.
謝謝，托馬先生，謝謝
Thanks, Mr. Toma. Thank you.
他准備好了，你准備好了，對嗎？
He's ready. You're ready, aren't ya?
和倫敦的西爾﹒內瑞爭拳王頭銜
Shea Neary in London
for the title.
你開玩笑嗎？我們得慶祝慶祝
Are you kidding,
we got some celebrating to do.
- 對
- 太謝謝了
- Yeah, I think so.
- Thank you so much.
- 我兒子要拿到偉大的拳王頭銜了
- 謝謝，托馬先生
- Gonna have a great champ in my boy.
- Thank you, Mr. Toma.
那是你哥哥夢寐以求的
It's what your brother
would've always wanted.
他不會到場的
He's not even gonna be there.
- 嘿！
- 爸爸！
- Hey!
- Daddy!
- 到這來，伙計
- 爸爸，爸爸！
- Come here, buddy.
- Daddy, Daddy!
見到你太好了！
Good to see you!
擁抱太棒了！擁抱太棒了！好！
That's a good hug!
That's a good hug! Yeah!
- 親愛的
- 嘿，媽
- Sweetheart.
- Hey, Ma.
噢，天吶， 你看上去狀態很不錯
Oh, you look so good. Oh, my God.
- 你牙齒變白了！
- 是啊！看我的牙！
- You have clean teeth.
- I do! Look at my teeth!
我換了新牙，什么都煥然一新
I got new teeth. Everything.
你覺得我看起來怎么樣？
How you think I look?
- 不錯
- 嗯？
- Good.
- Yeah?
蛋糕和更多的蛋糕
Cake and more cake.
- 冰激凌？
- 冰激凌和蛋糕
- Ice cream?
- Ice cream and cake.
冰激凌和蛋糕、蛋糕，是嗎？
Ice cream and cake and cake. Right?
冰激凌和蛋糕、蛋糕
冰激凌和蛋糕、蛋糕
Ice cream, cake and cake.
Ice cream, cake and cake...
哇！
Quacka!
媽
Ma.
- 他們給你換牙了，哈？
- 是
- They gave you some new teeth, huh?
- Yeah.
嘿，喬治，現在他們把你趕出房子了？
Hey, Georgie. What, they let
you outta the house now?
- 對
- 把你趕出房子，媽？
- Yeah.
- Lettin' him outta the house, Ma?
嘿，聽著，我想讓你見見薩爾﹒拉納羅
Hey, look, I want you
to meet Sal Lonano.
過得怎么樣，迪奇？
How you doing, Dicky?
我們打一場
Let's spar.
嘿，沙琳
Hey, Charlene.
歡迎回來！
Welcome back!
本該是驚喜的，你們遲到了
It's supposed to be a surprise.
You're late.
- Hey.
- Hey.
米奇，我自己都不知道
是不是期待著回到這間臭氣熏天的更衣室
Mick, I can't even tell you, being in
this smelly-ass locker room. You know?
和你一起打拳，這才能讓我撐過來
Being back with you,
this is what got me through.
- 你看上去不錯，你的眼神更清明了
- 嗯，你要知道…
- You look good. Your eyes are clear.
- Yeah. You know...
愛麗絲說也許蹲監獄是對我最好的安排
...Alice says prison might've
been the best thing for me.
讓我煥然一新，讓我頭腦清楚
Got me clean. Got me clear. Up here.
那樣很好，迪奇
It's a beautiful thing, Dick.
- 我有些事要和你談談
- 好
- I gotta talk to you about something.
- Yeah.
看看這柜子，還是原來的柜子
Look at this locker.
The old locker.
我愛這柜子，真他媽愛
I love it. Fuckin' love it.
我答應他們不再跟你合作了
I made a promise to them
I wouldn't work with you again.
發生了這么多事后，我只能這么辦，抱歉
I had to. After everything
that happened, I'm sorry.
你非要這樣嗎？
You stickin' to that?
我很高興你回來了，你狀態很不錯
I'm glad you're back. You look good.
我不知道還能說什么了
I don't know what else to say.
- 米奇，你跟我開玩笑嗎？
- 沒有
- Mick, you fuckin' kidding me?
- No, I'm not.
- 嘿，米奇！
- 過來！
- Oh, hey, Mick.
- Come on, come on!
你們得…，媽，請回家再弄吧
You gotta... Ma. You gotta
do this at home. Please?
你在說什么？怎么了？
What are you talkin' about?
What's the matter?
求你了？
Mom, please?
好，女孩們，打包走
All right, girls. Let's pack it up.
我知道，我們會在家里見到他
I know. We'll see him at home.
- 他媽怎么了？
- 你不能好好打包？
- What the hell?
- Would you please pack it up?
- 為什么？
- 讓我這么說
- Why?
- Let's get it put away.
如果米奇想我們走，我們就走
If that's what Micky wants,
we're gonna put it away.
- 你們的哥哥來了
- 迪奇…
- There's your brother.
- Dicky...
- 你們怎么樣？
- 米奇？
- How ya doing?
- Micky?
太漂亮了，很不錯
That's nice. That's nice.
我們准備了兩個星期了
We've been working on it
for two weeks.
謝里，干嘛呢，別哭了
Sherri, come on, stop it.
好吧，女孩們，咱們回家吧
All right, girls,
come on, let's go home.
顯然現在不是慶祝的時候
It's not the time to do this,
obviously. Come on.
你呆在這，到底他媽怎么了？
You stay here.
What the hell's going on?
- 出什么事了？
- 我們不會再一起打拳了
- What's going on?
- We ain't gonna work together.
他不想我和他一起工作
He don't want me to work with him.
你說什么？
What're you talking about?
這不對
That's not right.
沒有迪奇的話，米奇根本贏不了桑切斯
Micky never would've won
Sanchez without Dicky.
他媽的胡扯！收回你的話！
That's fuckin' bullshit! Take it back!
嘿，嘿，你他媽的別這么跟我媽說話
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Don't you fuckin'
talk to my mother that way.
- 靠！
- 靠！
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!
帶他們回去
Take 'em home.
你怎么不問問米奇？
Why don't you ask Micky?
我們要訓練了，他們該走了
If we're gonna train, they gotta go.
他們得走，米奇，你知道的
They gotta go, Mick, come on.
問他，喬治，你問他要是沒他哥哥
能贏桑切斯嗎？
Ask him, George. Ask him if he would've
won Sanchez without his brother?
嘿，把他帶出去，好嗎？
Hey, take him outside, all right?
要不是有迪奇的話，我贏不了桑切斯
No, I wouldn't have won Sanchez
if it wasn't for Dicky.
你怎么能對奧基夫說這種話？
How can you say that to O'Keefe?
因為這是事實
Because it's true.
我一開始按照我們制定的方案比賽
不起作用
I went with that game plan,
it wasn't working.
所以我又按照迪奇教我的做了
So I went back to what
I learned with Dicky.
奧基夫，沒有你的指導我也贏不了，好嗎？
And I wouldn't have won without you,
either, O'Keefe, OK?
我是說，你知道的，我們努力訓練
你讓我准備充分
I mean, you know that.
We worked hard. You got me ready.
是奧基夫讓你重拾自信和重心
You got your confidence
and your focus from O'Keefe,
還有薩爾，你父親和我
and from Sal and
your father and from me.
- 迪奇只是個癮君子
- 嘿
- Dicky's a junk bag.
- Hey.
他只是個癮君子！
He's a junk bag!
- 操你，沙琳
- 操你才對
- Fuck you, Charlene.
- Fuck you.
- 我有8個月不沾毒品了
- 是嗎
- I'm eight months sober.
- Oh, yeah,
那我肯定你既然出獄了
你一定要從米奇身上拿別的東西了
and I'm sure you're gonna need
something now that you're out.
“噢，我的背！噢，我的背出毛病了！”
"Oh, my back. Oh, my back."
- 你他媽干嗎一直找我的岔？
- 不，操你！
- Fuck you always picking on me for?
- No, fuck you!
那奧基夫呢？我們都訓練過米奇
And what about O'Keefe?
We're in the same boat.
曾几何時，對吧，奧基夫，你懂的
One day at a fucking time, right,
O'Keefe? You know what I mean?
為什么他都可以在這待著
What, it's all right
for him to be here?
為什么我就不行了？
我是他的兄弟，是他的家人
Why am I the fuckin' problem?
I'm his blood, I'm his family!
- 你知道自己是個麻煩！
- 我才是上拳台的那個
- You are the problem!
- I'm the one fighting, OK?
不是你，不是你，也不是你
Not you, not you, and not you.
- 我知道我需要什么
- 你需要迪奇？
- I know what I need.
- And you need Dicky?
我想迪奇回來
I want Dicky back.
我需要你，沙琳，我也需要奧基夫
And I want you, Charlene.
And I want O'Keefe.
我需要我的家人，這有什么錯嗎？
I want my family.
What's wrong with that?
我們說好不行的，寶貝
It's not the deal we made, baby.
她說得對，米奇，我們約好的
She's right, Micky.
That's not the deal.
拜托，你不能這樣對我們
It wasn't the deal.
Come on, you can't do this to us.
- 你現在跟他們一個口氣
- 現在我跟他們一個口氣？
- You sound like them now.
- I sound like them now?
- 對
- 你才是和他們一個口氣
- Yeah, you sound like them.
- You sound like them.
我怎么能如此對你？“你不能這么對我們
How could I do this to you?
"You can't do that to us.
他不能這么對我們”你就像他們
He can't do that to us."
You sound like them.
你他媽該自我反省下
You should fuckin' listen to yourself.
你跟他們一個口氣，也許你們本來就是一家
You sound like them and maybe
this is where you belong.
你就是這樣愛他的？
That's the way you love him?
- 沙琳！
- 別這樣
- Charlene!
- Come on!
- 你想要你哥哥回來？祝你好運
- 奧基夫，別這樣
- You wanted your brother? Good luck.
- O'Keefe, come on.
- 米克
- 米克
- Mickey.
- Mickey.
別這樣，事出有因
Come on, everything
happens for a reason.
你知道嗎？也許這樣最好，主自有安排
You know? Maybe it's for the best.
God has a plan.
想和你哥切磋下嗎？
Wanna spar with your brother?
迪奇﹒埃克隆，洛厄爾之驕傲
Dick Eklund, pride of Lowell!
那場比賽看了很多年了，哈？
Watching that for years, huh?
米奇，米奇！
Micky, Micky!
哇，嘿！你該死的在干嘛？
Whoa, hey!
What the hell are you doing?
米奇！
Micky!
- 爸爸！爸爸！
- 我的天啊！
- Daddy! Daddy, Daddy!
- For crying out loud!
把孩子帶出去
Take that baby out of here.
我十分鐘前就告訴你把他帶走了！
I told you take him away
ten minutes ago!
寶貝，你沒事吧？你還好吧？你的背沒事？
Sweetheart, you all right?
You OK? Your back?
你在干嘛？瘋了？
What are you doing?
What's the matter with you?
是我要比賽，愛麗絲，哪怕一次
Can this be my fight, Alice?
Just once?
哪怕就一次，不是為了迪奇？
Maybe just this one time
not for Dicky?
我知道你覺得他要重振雄風
I know you think he's coming back.
可他都40歲了，嘴里的牙都不齊全了
He's 40 years old and doesn't
have a tooth in his head
- 連一顆自己的都沒
- 我還可以打十回合
- that's his fuckin' own.
- I'll go fuckin' ten rounds.
讓你弟弟把話說完，好嗎？
Let your brother talk
for a minute here, all right?
- 你想說什么，寶貝？
- 我是西爾﹒內瑞
- What are you sayin', sweetheart?
- I'm Shea Neary...
閉嘴，否則我打爆你的頭，迪奇
Shut up before I bust your
fuckin' head open, Dicky.
- 嘿，嘿
- 你想干嘛？我就是西爾﹒內瑞
- Hey, hey...
- What're you gonna do? I'm Shea Neary.
你想我把你的頭打開花嗎？
You want me to bust
your fuckin' head open?
勸一下，喬治，做點什么！
Come on, come on! George, please!
- 迪奇！
- 你說什么？
- Dicky!
- Please! What are you saying?
- 告訴我你要說什么
- 這應該是我的比賽
- Tell me what you're saying.
- This is supposed to be my fight.
是我參加頭銜賽的機會
以后我再不會有機會了
This is my shot at a title.
I won't get another one after this.
- 我很自私嗎？
- 不
- Am I being selfish?
- No.
我說過“米奇，米奇？”
你知道嗎，如果我說過，抱歉
Am I saying, "Micky, Micky, Micky?"
You know what? If I am, I'm sorry.
我認為是我為了冠軍賽而奮斗
I thought I was fightin'
for the championship.
我還認為你也是我媽媽
And I thought you
were my mother, too.
我是你媽媽
I am your mother.
對，媽
Yeah, Ma.
米奇，抱歉，我不知道你有這種感受，好嗎？
Mick, I'm sorry. I had no idea
you felt like that, all right?
如果是我的錯，我一定會改正的
If I made mistakes,
I'm gonna be better.
我不想傷害你，我很抱歉
I don't wanna hurt you.
I am so sorry. I'm sorry.
迪奇！
Dicky!
陪著他
Stay with him.
迪奇…迪奇！
Dicky... Dicky!
- 迪奇！
- 我有事要做
- Dicky!
- Gotta do something.
迪奇，等等，拜托！
Dicky, wait, come on!
- 米奇需要你，我需要你
- 我有事要做
- Micky wants you! I want you!
- I gotta do something.
我知道你的意思，別那么做！
I know what that means.
Don't do this!
“洛厄爾之驕傲”回來了
嘿，陳
Hey, Chan.
- 你們好嗎？
- 嘿，迪奇
- What's going on?
- Hey, Dicky.
嘿，迪奇回來了
Hey, Dicky's back!
Hey!
看看你！
Look at you!
還好嗎，小子？你呢？見到你真好，兄弟
What's up, my boy?
How you doing? Good to see you, man.
- 你氣色不錯 歡迎回來
- 你看上去好極了
- You look good. Welcome back.
- Yeah, you're looking good.
- 太好了
- 見到你太好了
- Great.
- Good to see ya.
- 歡迎回家
- 嗨，親愛的
- Welcome home.
- Hi, honey.
還好嗎，伙計？你看上去不錯
What's up, man?
You're looking good.
- 上樓待一會？
- 迪奇回來了
- Wanna head upstairs?
- Dicky's back.
- 嘿，迪奇，我們要好好慶祝下
- 上樓去？
- Hi, Dicky. We're gonna party.
- Go upstairs, man?
- 上樓待會？
- 我們想死你了！
- Go upstairs, take a while?
- We missed you!
- 走吧，兄弟
- 來，迪奇
- Let's go, buddy.
- Come on, Dicky.
- 給你辦個小派對
- 嘿，回來
- Make for a little party for you...
- Hey, come back.
- 就那么走了？
- 那算什么？
- What the fuck's that all about?
- What the hell was that?
沙琳？我是迪奇
Charlene? It's Dicky.
從我門廊滾開，你這個垃圾
Get off my porch,
you piece of shit.
你還敢按…
How fuckin' dare you...
混蛋
... cocksucker...
靠
... fuckin'...
你個混球，迪奇
You're a fuckin' asshole, Dicky.
我要你該死的滾開！
I want you off my fuckin' porch!
為什么你不你直接下來和我當面說？
Why don't you just fuckin'
come down here and talk to me?
你這混蛋，到我家來，垃圾！
Such an asshole, coming to my
fucking house. You piece of shit!
- 站在我家門廊…
- 沙琳
- Standing on my porch...
- Charlene...
街罵是婊子才干的
It's not fuckin' lady-like to be
shoutin' in the street like this.
你這個來這搗亂的混蛋！
You're such a fuckin' cocksucker
coming over here.
- 求你了？
- 哦，是嗎？你以為我他媽在乎？
- Please?
- Oh, yeah, you think I fuckin' care?
- 下來，開門…
- 從我門口滾走，迪奇！
- Come on, just fuckin'...
- Get off my fuckin' porch, Dicky!
你難道就不能下來和我談談？
Would you just fuckin'
come down here... and talk to me?
這狗什么品種的？是英國可卡犬嗎？
What kind of dog is that?
Is that a Cocker Spaniel?
好吧，我知道你討厭我
All right, I know you
can't fuckin' stand me.
是嗎，你憑什么這么說？
Really, what makes you say that?
因為我也知道自己以前很混，但我弟弟愛你
I ain't got no use for you, either.
All right? But my brother loves ya.
你不能因為我而離開他
And you can't just
run away because of me.
他不該承受那些，知道嗎？
He don't deserve that. All right?
所以如果你希望我退出，我就退出
So I will quit if you want me to quit.
- 鬼才信
- 我發誓
- You're full of shit.
- I swear to God.
如果你回來，我就退出，好嗎？
I will quit if it means
you'll come back, all right?
但我希望你能考慮一下
But I want you to think about something.
米奇有機會去做我從未做過的事情
Micky has a chance to do
something that I never did.
在我這個打拳的時候，沒有得到冠軍
That in my time, I never had.
哦，對，我最大的成功
就是和舒格﹒雷﹒倫納德對打
"Oh, yeah, my big chance
was with Sugar Ray Leonard.
我太偉大了，我是他媽洛厄爾之驕傲
I'm so great.
I'm the pride of fuckin' Lowell.
對，我打敗了舒格﹒雷”我已經聽煩了
Oh, yeah, I fought Sugar Ray Leonard."
I've heard it.
我是來糾正錯誤的
I came here to make things right.
- 好
- 嗯
- OK, let's make things right.
- Yeah.
第一，你根本沒有打敗舒格﹒雷
他自己絆倒的
Number one: You didn't knock down
Sugar Ray Leonard. He tripped.
我當時就在拳擊台
你以為我不知道那天發生了什么嗎？
I was in the ring. Don't you think
I know what really happened that day?
是嗎？你這輩子都干了什么？
All right? What have you
ever done with your life?
- 我愛我的生活
- 是嗎？那你奮斗過么？
- I like my life.
- Yeah, what you ever done with it?
- 我喜歡現在的生活，迪奇
- 你這輩子都干了什么？
- I like my life now, Dicky.
- What have you done with your life?
你只是個輟學生，沙琳
You're a college dropout, Charlene.
你只不過是個酒吧女服務生
你的生活糟糕透了
You're just a little bar girl.
Your life sucks.
好吧，我承認我酗酒
All right. I drank too much.
我在很多酒吧工作過
I worked in a lot of bars.
我錯失了很多機會，但是在這里我想做更好
And I ruined a lot of opportunities, but
I'm trying to do something better here.
- 米奇也是
- 我也是
- And so is Micky.
- And so am I.
他需要我，你親耳聽到的
而我知道他也需要你
And he needs me. You heard him.
And I know he needs you.
你胳膊上那藍色的玩意兒是什么？
What is that blue shit on your arm?
糖霜
It's icing.
我們米奇那見，不然你就滾一邊去
OK. I'll see ya in Micky's corner.
Otherwise, go fuck yourself.
- 好
- 說定了
- It's a deal.
- All right? It's a deal.
我們倆和解了，問她
We worked it out for you. Ask her.
很好，去把奧基夫也找來
Good. Go get O'Keefe back, too.
我會的
I will.
嘿，米奇
Hey, Mick...
你覺得我是把舒格﹒雷有效擊倒嗎？
You think I knocked down
Sugar Ray Leonard?
你打了十個回合
是最好的戰朮而他卻對你束手無策
Went ten rounds. One of the best
ever and he couldn't hurt you.
你是我的英雄
You were my hero.
曾經是
I was.
曾經是
I was.
很抱歉
I'm sorry.
真的？
You are?
* 你難道沒聽見我在敲你窗？ *
* 你難道沒聽見我在敲你門？ *
* 你難道沒聽見我在清理骯臟的街道？ *
沃德對內瑞，倫敦
世界拳擊聯盟次重量級冠軍爭霸賽
* 嘿，寶貝來幫我下，我不是陌生人 *
* 寶貝來幫我下，我不是陌生人 *
* 寶貝來幫我下，我不是陌生人 *
樓下有個新聞發布會
There's a press conference downstairs.
來吧，我們走
Come on, let's go.
端好茶，伙計！
Spot of tea, mate!
內瑞：十英石（170磅），再加6磅
Neary: Ten stone... six pound.
沃德：十英石，再加6磅
Ward: Ten stone... six pound.
嘿，米奇，米奇﹒沃德！我們有個問題
Hey, Micky, Micky Ward!
We have a question over here.
- 你一直怎么訓練的？
- 訓練，努力訓練
- How you been training?
- I train, I train hard.
西爾是22戰全勝，從沒被擊倒過
Shea's 22 and 0.
He's never been knocked down.
- 明天就不會那樣了
- 實際上我們期待
- That's gonna change tomorrow.
- In fact, we expected
一個更出色的拳擊手
a much better fighter.
我很感激能有機會坐在這里
I'm just grateful to be here
and have the opportunity.
謝謝大家的提問
Thank you guys for the shot.
西爾，你認為誰才算個拳擊手
下場比賽你想挑戰誰
Shea, who do you respect as a fighter?
And who would you like to fight next?
我想明天直接擊倒米奇﹒沃德
I plan on moving right
through Micky Ward tomorrow.
挑戰更厲害的選手，比如加迪
Moving on to other great fighters,
like Gatti.
我相信我和加迪才是實力旗鼓相當
Yeah, I believe Gatti and I
would make a great match.
你害怕嗎，沃德先生？
Are you scared, Mr. Ward?
現在，女士們先生們，世界拳擊聯盟
And now, ladies and
gentlemen, 12 rounds of boxing
十二回合制次重量級拳擊手冠軍爭霸賽
正式開始！
for the WBU Welterweight
Championship of the World!
我看不到了！
I can't see!
* 我再次獨自出征 *
Here I go again on my own
* 走著自己唯一知道的道路 *
Goin' down the only road
I've ever known
* 像流浪者，我生而獨行 *
Like a drifter
I was born to walk alone
- 嘿，伙計們，出發了
- * 我已決定 *
- Hey, fellas, let's go.
- I made up my mind
* 絕無躊躇 *
I ain't wasting no more time
* 我再次獨自出征 *
Here I go again on my own
* 走著自己唯一知道的道路 *
Going down the only road
I've ever known
* 像流浪者，我生而獨行 *
Like a drifter I was born
to walk alone
別聽他們的，米奇
Don't listen to 'em, Mick.
* 我已決定 *
I made up my mind
* 絕無躊躇 *
I ain't wasting no more time...
現在上場的是來自
馬薩諸塞州洛厄爾的米奇﹒沃德
And there is Micky Ward
of Lowell, Massachusetts,
這是他在海外的第一場比賽
entering the ring. It's his
first fight outside the United States.
米奇﹒沃德：勝30場 敗7場
他最近狀態轉佳，20次擊倒對手
Micky Ward: 30 wins, seven losses.
He's gotten better recently, 20 KOs.
現在沃德在等待他的對手西爾上場
And now Ward awaits his
opponent, Shea Neary.
西爾將自己比作歐洲的阿圖羅﹒加迪
Neary regards himself
as the European Arturo Gatti.
意為他是一個正面出擊型選手
Meaning that he is a head-on,
high-contact fighter
他一回合能出拳七十次
who throws 70 punches per round.
西爾來自利物浦，今晚應該會有
Neary's from Liverpool
and should have
很多粉絲
a huge following here tonight.
他由瑪宏斯一家率領的“狂歡”團隊陪同
Accompanied
by Paint the Town Red by The Mahones.
西爾是現今世界次重量級拳擊比賽的冠軍
Neary is the current
Welterweight Champion of the World.
他是一個堅韌不拔的年輕人
全身心投入拳擊
He is a very tough young man.
Beyond dedicated.
如同斯巴達勇士在世，據他的經紀人所說
Lives a Spartan existence.
And according to his promoters,
他的生活里除了吃、喝、思考
does nothing but eat,
drink, think, fantasize...
就是對拳擊的夢想
...dream of fighting.
西爾22場職業拳賽全勝
Shea Neary has had 22
professional fights and won them all.
17次有效擊倒
Seventeen KOs.
鈴響時比賽開始，記得規則，請先握手
Come out when you hear the bell.
Don't piss about. Shake hands.
你們兩個，請先握手
Both of ya... shake hands!
正如我們在拳擊場中央看到的一樣
As close as we just saw
them in the middle of the ring,
- 他們針鋒相對
- 你看到了嗎？
- forehead to forehead,
- Did you see that?
我們也期待
他們呈現給我們一場精彩紛呈的拳擊比賽
That's how close we expect them to be
for as long as this fight goes on.
沃德非本土作戰
Ward is a long ways from home.
可能會水土不服
Don't coast in a foreign country.
沃德面臨的最大的挑戰
Well, the big challenge for Ward
是他要比平時更快進入攻擊狀態
is to get off to a faster start
than is customary for him.
米奇﹒沃德是在大賽中出了名的慢熱型選手
Micky Ward, a notoriously
slow starter in big fights,
而西爾則是個超快速攻擊型選手
Shea Neary, an ultra-fast starter.
第一回合的懸念正在于此
And that's the question
that hovers over round one.
沃德做好大戰的准備了嗎？
Will Ward be ready for the fight?
才一開場，西爾已經讓沃德陷入險境
Already, Shea Neary starts
taking it to him on the ropes!
轉而攻擊身體，而這恰恰是沃德的專長
And Neary going to the body,
which is Ward's specialty.
西爾猛擊沃德的身體
Neary bangs Ward to the body.
緊接猛一記上鉤拳
And a big uppercut by Neary.
內瑞以一記漂亮的左刺拳展開攻擊
Neary leads off with a good left jab.
- 加油，米奇！
- 使沃德失去平衡
- Come on, Micky!
- Keeps Ward off balance,
用刺拳不停猛擊
jabbing here and there.
內瑞靠近沃德，以一記漂亮的左勾拳攻擊
There's a good left hook
by Neary as he stepped in on Ward.
如果內瑞一直靠近打，沃德就不能很好還手
Ward not able to deal with him very well
when Neary stands at range like this.
- 加油！
- 就是這樣！打倒他！
- Come on!
- That's it! Get him!
米奇﹒沃德用左勾拳攻擊西爾頭部
And a left hook
lands up top from Micky Ward.
內瑞不停用右拳攻擊對方身體
Neary digging his
own right hand to the body.
他們在近距離內互相攻擊
They trade shots at close range.
沃德試圖以牙還牙
Ward, he's trying
to match Neary blow for blow
但內瑞開始加大攻擊力度
充分利用第一回合剩下的三十秒
and now Neary starts to come on and
take the last 30 seconds of the round...
感覺怎么樣？
How about that?
分開！
Break!
第一分鐘就有如此漂亮密集進攻，看看吧
Tremendous barrage in
the first minute. Just look at this.
- 難以置信
- 第一回合太精彩了！
- Unbelievable.
- What a great round one!
沃德必須要加快速度
Ward is gonna have
to pick up the tempo
以大量的出拳攻擊對手
and beat him with volumes of punching.
毫無疑問內瑞是個更為出色的拳擊手
No doubt, Neary is a better boxer.
在最后一分鐘內瑞四記重拳
Four hard right hands...
Neary has belted in the last minute.
比沃德更快，更果斷
Quicker than Ward,
more assertive than Ward,
也更確信自己該怎么做
surer of what he wants to do.
他們站在拳擊場中央互相攻擊
They're standing and trading shots
at the center of the ring.
沃德必須要比現在的進攻
Ward's gonna have
to step it up a little bit more
更快一些才行
than he is right now.
米奇的助手正在審視
Micky Ward's corner
taking a real deep look
場上局勢
at what's going on now.
他在場外的家人清楚的知道他正逐漸出擊
And his family at ringside well aware
he's stepping up in class.
沃德的攻擊很無力，他應該更具攻擊性
Ward has fallen to the pedal.
He's gotta be more aggressive.
他不能一直等所謂的完美時機
He can't just try to wait
until everything is perfect.
西爾的壓倒性優勢會隨比賽的進行增加
His dominance over Micky Ward
is increasing as the fight goes on
因為他的技朮戰略是正確且在施行的
because his technical plan
was the right one and he's executing it.
這樣出拳讓整場比賽看起來
Punches like these make it seem...
是內瑞一個人的戰爭
...that it's now Neary's fight.
沃德從未參加過這種比賽
Ward hasn't been in this kind of war
面對像內瑞這樣如此強大的對手
with this strong of fighter as Neary.
他們試圖只用猛擊來傷害對方
They are trying
to hurt each other with every punch.
他們已經考驗過彼此的意志力
現在考驗的是雙方的技朮
They've tested each other's will,
now they're testing each other's skill.
沃德被內瑞的右交叉拳打得站立不穩
And Ward wobbled there
by a right cross from Neary!
沃德現在受傷了，他的腿不能動彈
Ward hurting now. His legs are gone.
內瑞開始攻擊他的身體，試圖結束比賽
Neary goes to the body
as he tries to finish Micky.
都是很毒辣的身體攻擊
Vicious body shots from Neary.
沃德都不試著離開圍繩！
And Ward still doesn't
even try to move off the ropes!
我不知道他還有沒有機會，吉姆
I don't know if he can, Jim.
他等著內瑞把他打出局
He's waiting for Neary
to punch himself out.
米奇倒下了，他有可能會出局
Down goes Micky Ward! He may be out.
That ain't fuckin' it!
他媽夠了！
- 1，2
- 對！就是那樣！
- One... two...
- Come on! That's it!
- 我的好小子！
- 向前！向前！上！
- That's my boy!
- Forward! Forward! Come on!
沃德的雙腳已不聽使喚
Ward is out on his feet.
輸家！滾回美國去吧！
Loser! Go back to America!
- 米奇可能就這樣結束比賽了
- 迪奇，給他一張凳子
- This could be it for Micky Ward.
- Dicky, give him the fuckin' stool.
沙琳，別攪合
Charlene, will you get
the fuck outta here.
他需要坐下！
He needs to fuckin' sit down!
他哥哥試圖用跳躍來喚醒沃德的雙腿
His brother's got
Ward jumping to wake up his legs.
我覺得這有可能是
沃德的最后一次反轉戰局的機會了
I think this could be Ward's last chance
to turn this fight around.
現在是米奇﹒沃德在抵抗
攻擊猛烈，出拳利落的西爾﹒內瑞
It's Micky Ward
against the aggressiveness
and clean punching of Shea Neary.
如果不加強防備，真的會受傷的
If you don't have your defense up,
you can really get hurt.
他讓米奇處境非常艱難
He's making it very
difficult for Micky Ward.
照這樣下去，我覺得他勝算不大
I don't think he's gonna
get into it at this rate.
這是你死我亡
This is a survival mode...
你像我一樣嗎？
強大到可以與舒格﹒雷抗衡？
Are you like me? Was just
good enough to fight Sugar Ray?
我不一定要贏，一定嗎？
Never had to win, did I?
你還要更加努力，你會獲得冠軍
You gotta do more in there.
You gotta win a title.
為你，為我，為了洛厄爾
For you, for me, for Lowell.
輪到你表現了，好嗎？把握好
This is your time, all right?
You take it.
我原本有機會的，但是搞砸了
你不必重蹈覆轍
I had my time and I blew it.
You don't have to.
現在你他媽的趕緊上場
All right?
You fuckin' get out there,
用你練得純熟的技朮
and use all the shit
that you've been through,
和這些年你所付出的努力
all the shit we've gone through
over the fuckin' years
是時候在拳擊場上發泄了
這是屬于你的機會，屬于你的
and you put it in that ring right now.
This is yours. This is fuckin' yours.
好，“頭，身體，頭，身體”
OK. Fuckin' head, body, head, body.
跟我重復一遍，該死的，重復!
Say it back to me.
Fuckin' say it back to me.
- “頭，身體，頭，身體”
- “頭，身體，頭，身體”
- Head, body, head, body.
- Head, body, head, body.
銘刻到腦海，冠軍是你的，放手一搏
Get in your mind this is
fucking yours. Fuckin' do it.
別他媽的老靠在繩子上
Stay off the fuckin' ropes.
如果今晚我是米奇﹒沃德的助手的話
If I'm in Micky Ward's corner tonight,
會想如果他這一輪還拿不出什么本事來的話
I thinking if he doesn't pick things up
this round and get going,
他將會徹底被淘汰
he'll just get totally wiped out.
遠離繩子！遠離繩子！米奇！
Off the ropes!
Get off the ropes, Mick!
又一次，沃德倚著繩子任由內瑞攻擊
Once again, Ward against
the ropes as Neary is free to attack.
你在干什么？上，米奇
What are you doing? Come on, Mick!
有時候你必須要成為一個完全不同的人
才有可能獲得成功
Sometimes if you wanna win,
you gotta be something that you're not.
上！
Come on!
離開繩子，老兄！那不是對手！
Off the fuckin' ropes, Mick,
that ain't it!
內瑞的拳頭暴風雨般落在米奇身上
Neary continues to pound away.
別受辱了！輪到你表現自己了，米奇！
Don't take no abuse!
This is your time Micky! It's up to you!
- 內瑞打空兩拳！
- 就是這樣！就是這樣！
- Two big misses by Neary!
- That's it! That's it!
看起來沃德的腿找回知覺了
Ward seemingly getting his legs back.
他打得內瑞后退
He backs Neary off.
- 他開始報復了
- 就是那樣！
- Ward trades his way back.
- That's it!
沃德點頭，仿佛在說“放馬過來！”
Ward nods as if to say,
"Come on!"
“來啊，我們來大干一場”
"Come on, let's fight!"
當然如果你買了票只能自己想象了
Just imagine if you bought a ticket.
沃德出拳離內瑞的胸膛越來越近
Closer and closer to Neary's ribcage.
局面開始傾向于米奇
This is becoming Micky Ward's fight.
一記左勾拳，又來一記上勾拳
And a left hook to the body
and an uppercut lands
- 現在他把內瑞打的節節敗退
- “頭，身體，頭，身體”
- and now he backs Neary off.
- Head, body, head fuckin' body!
沃德打中了內瑞的身體
Ward hurt Neary with a body shot.
再用左拳猛擊身體
Ward hurts him again
with that left to the body.
哦，內瑞第一次倒地了
Oh, and that one plants
Neary on his butt.
23場職業賽中第一次
First time in 23 professional fights
- 西爾﹒內瑞被打倒在地
- 就是這樣！就是這樣！
- that Shea Neary has been down.
- This is it! This is it!
就是這樣，米奇！
This is it, Micky!
保持狀態！不要看我！全力攻擊他！
Keep going! Don't look at me for it!
Take it to him!
- 上，米奇，全力以赴！
- 沃德又猛來一記左勾拳
- Come on, Micky, get in there!
- Ward lands a huge left hook!
他發力了！
As Micky Ward pounds away!
用左勾拳猛擊對手身體，又一記上勾拳！
Goes to the body with the left hook!
Lands the uppercut again!
內瑞第二次倒地
Neary down for the second time.
米奇要結束這場比賽了
Mickey Vann's gonna stop it there.
“愛爾蘭人”米奇﹒沃德
第八回合技朮性壓倒對手！
"Irish" Micky Ward
with a big eighth-round TKO!
他又一次做到了
He's done it again.
他又一次做到了
He's done it again.
備受折磨但大膽出擊的米奇﹒沃德
又獲得了一場大勝！
The grinding, gutty Micky Ward
pulls out another big victory!
你成為了世界冠軍，米奇！
你他媽的成了世界冠軍了
You're the champion of the world, Mick!
You're the fuckin' champ of the world!
你做到了！
You fuckin' did it!
你是最棒的！
Oh, you're the best!
- 愛死你了！
- 我兒子是世界冠軍了！
- Oh, I love you!
- My boy's the champion of the world!
我愛你！
I love you!
這個小鎮的人以前一直說
你是個狗日的拳擊手，對嗎？
This town always said,
you're a fuckin' boxer, right?
他以前總是沒有自信
但他現在重新給洛厄爾帶來了榮耀
He thought he was a piece of shit. He
put Lowell back on the map, you know?
- 是我們
- 我告訴你
- We.
- I tell ya...
- 是我們
- 不，等會
- We.
- No, but hold on.
誰曾經是“洛厄爾之驕傲”？
Who used to be the pride of Lowell?
是我，誰現在是“洛厄爾之驕傲”？
Right here.
Who's the pride of Lowell now?
是他，這是注定的，你知道嗎？
Right there.
That's how it's meant to be, you know?
這叫做傳承
Handin' it down to him.
沒有比這更好的了，沒有比這更好的了
Nothin' better than that.
Nothin' better than that.
他做到了，我該走了，我該走了
He did it. I gotta go.
I gotta go.
米奇﹒沃德接著與阿圖羅﹒加迪進行了三場史詩級的比賽
這迎來了他第一筆七位數收入，他已于2003年退役
米奇在2005年與沙琳結婚
并和他的女兒凱西在洛厄爾定居
迪奇任然是當地傳奇性人物
并在他弟弟的體育館里訓練拳手
以下鏡頭是現實中的迪奇和米奇
哦，看那個癮君子布布！哇哇！
Oh, look at cabbage head. Boo Boo!
Quacka!
- 怎么了，兄弟？
- 阿布，你牙呢？
- What's up buddy?
- Boo, where's your teeth?
我被逮捕了，快走，離開這！
Oh, I'm under arrest!
Let's go, move it out!
這是真實的，對嗎？
It's been real, ain't it?
既是真實的，也是虛幻的
總之是一段精彩的經歷
It's been real, it's been unreal.
It's been a great experience.
我慶幸終于拍完了
Just glad it's done, finally,
我從心底非常感謝大家
and thanks to everyone so much,
from the bottom of my heart.
謝謝所有的好萊塢工作人員
Thanks so much,
all you Hollywood people.
現在你知道我說插不上嘴是什么意思了
Now you know what I mean
when I say I can't get a word in.
我告訴你們，他從來都插不上嘴
I'm telling ya.
He'll never get a word in.
- 好了，謝謝
- 謝謝
- All right, thank you.
- Thank you.
各位，愿世界和平
Peace, everybody.
