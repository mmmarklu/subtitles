1
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,666
 Ball one to Johnny Damon and we are under way.

2
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:39,735
Damon has eight hits in 18 at bats,

3
00:00:39,938 --> 00:00:42,406
a double, a triple, a couple of stolen bases.

4
00:00:42,608 --> 00:00:44,701
He had four hits in the series opener.

5
00:00:46,044 --> 00:00:47,602
Strike.

6
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:02,188
Down the right-field line, fair off the bat of Damon.

7
00:01:02,394 --> 00:01:05,295
It rolls by Spencer.

8
00:01:05,497 --> 00:01:09,058
And Damon will coast into second base with a leadoff double.

9
00:01:14,006 --> 00:01:17,373
Into right-center field, broken bat, it'll fall, a base hit.

10
00:01:17,576 --> 00:01:19,510
They waVe around Damon. He will score.

11
00:01:19,711 --> 00:01:21,975
And Jason Giambi deliVers

12
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:25,081
with a run-scoring single here in the opening inning.

13
00:01:25,284 --> 00:01:27,775
And the Athletics haVe taken that 1-nothing lead.

14
00:01:27,986 --> 00:01:29,886
Go, come on, now. We gotta spin it.

15
00:01:36,862 --> 00:01:39,296
Let's go, Yankees!

16
00:01:39,498 --> 00:01:41,898
Let's go, Yankees!

17
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,068
Let's go, Yankees!

18
00:01:44,703 --> 00:01:47,433
Let's go, Yankees!

19
00:01:47,639 --> 00:01:48,765
 Bases loaded.

20
00:01:48,974 --> 00:01:52,967
The Yankees haVe the tying run at second, down 2-nothing.

21
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:01,278
The A 's are kicking it and throwing it all oVer the field.

22
00:02:01,486 --> 00:02:05,513
And it might lead to their elimination if they don't get it right in a hurry.

23
00:02:05,724 --> 00:02:09,353
Hammered down the right-field line. Justice!

24
00:02:10,329 --> 00:02:12,229
The Yankees haVe taken the lead.

25
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,832
They're standing, anticipating another trip

26
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:24,202
to the League championship Series.

27
00:02:24,409 --> 00:02:26,639
The Yankees one out away.

28
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:32,708
Eric Byrnes, never with an at bat in Yankee Stadium,

29
00:02:32,918 --> 00:02:35,546
and they don't get much bigger than this one.

30
00:02:35,754 --> 00:02:39,281
Or more hectic when you're up there trying to get a job done.

31
00:03:01,446 --> 00:03:03,937
And they're a strike away.

32
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,742
And they're roaring in the Bronx.

33
00:03:09,588 --> 00:03:13,991
Losing the first two games at home in the best-of-fiVe series

34
00:03:14,192 --> 00:03:16,057
and roar back to...

35
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,881
 The Yankees will defend their title.

36
00:03:56,435 --> 00:03:58,835
It's okay, Joe, you can leave it on.

37
00:03:59,037 --> 00:04:01,733
I don't need to watch. Joe, leave it on.

38
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:02,929
Okay.

39
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:15,114
Imagine how bad it'd be if you were a Yankee player

40
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,618
and didn't like the taste of champagne.

41
00:04:19,057 --> 00:04:20,354
Better ask to get traded.

42
00:04:20,559 --> 00:04:23,926
You gotta giVe the Yankees...

43
00:04:24,129 --> 00:04:25,721
- win the big game.

44
00:04:25,931 --> 00:04:29,697
 What a series that is gonna be in the next...

45
00:04:37,409 --> 00:04:39,775
You know how many kids are wearing Giambi's...?

46
00:04:39,978 --> 00:04:43,539
You know, Oakland Giambi's jerseys and hats and pictures and posters?

47
00:04:43,748 --> 00:04:47,184
Those same kids will be booing in July when the Yankees come here.

48
00:04:47,385 --> 00:04:51,583
Is it Giambi that's stabbing the back or the Pinstripes on the East coast?

49
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:54,281
You can't blame them for pilfering the henhouse.

50
00:04:54,493 --> 00:04:56,723
The henhouse is there. I can't blame them?

51
00:04:56,928 --> 00:05:00,193
They're offering $ 120 million oVer six years.

52
00:05:00,398 --> 00:05:04,027
The Yankees haVe deeper pockets and they're willing to giVe him money.

53
00:05:04,236 --> 00:05:05,794
They're pilfering our players.

54
00:05:06,004 --> 00:05:09,371
It's like we're a farm system for the new York Yankees.

55
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,648
How are the guys doing? That was a killer.

56
00:05:17,849 --> 00:05:20,784
That was a killer. It's a tough one to swallow. It's...

57
00:05:20,986 --> 00:05:23,546
They played great. They played their hearts out.

58
00:05:23,755 --> 00:05:26,952
They did. They played fantastic. It just didn't fall our way.

59
00:05:27,159 --> 00:05:30,060
You'll do better next year. But we were close, though.

60
00:05:30,262 --> 00:05:32,253
We were so close. Right there.

61
00:05:32,464 --> 00:05:34,830
Almost had it. You gotta feel good about that.

62
00:05:35,033 --> 00:05:38,230
I feel great about it. I feel great about it.

63
00:05:41,306 --> 00:05:42,739
Um...

64
00:05:43,008 --> 00:05:45,272
We're not gonna do better next year.

65
00:05:45,477 --> 00:05:48,344
Why not? Well, you know we're being gutted.

66
00:05:48,547 --> 00:05:53,484
We're losing Giambi, Damon, Isringhausen.

67
00:05:53,685 --> 00:05:56,245
Done deal. We're in trouble.

68
00:05:56,454 --> 00:06:00,322
You'll find new guys. You found Jason, you found Damon.

69
00:06:00,525 --> 00:06:01,992
I need more money, Steve. Billy.

70
00:06:02,194 --> 00:06:04,321
I need more money. We don't have any.

71
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:07,089
I can't compete against $ 120 million with $38 million.

72
00:06:07,299 --> 00:06:10,564
We're not gonna compete with these teams that have big budgets.

73
00:06:10,769 --> 00:06:13,397
We're gonna work within the constraints we have,

74
00:06:13,605 --> 00:06:17,336
and you're gonna do the best job that you can recruiting new players.

75
00:06:17,542 --> 00:06:19,772
We're not gonna pay $ 17 million to players.

76
00:06:19,978 --> 00:06:22,139
I'm not asking you

77
00:06:23,215 --> 00:06:25,080
for 10 or 20, 30 million dollars.

78
00:06:25,283 --> 00:06:27,046
I'm just asking for a bit of help.

79
00:06:27,252 --> 00:06:30,881
Get me a little closer and I will get you that championship team.

80
00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:35,321
I mean, this is why I'm here. This is why you hired me.

81
00:06:35,527 --> 00:06:39,327
And I gotta ask you, what are we doing here

82
00:06:39,531 --> 00:06:42,091
Billy, l... if it's not to win a championship?

83
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,701
I wanna win just as much... That's my bar. My bar is here.

84
00:06:46,304 --> 00:06:48,772
My bar is to take this team to the championship.

85
00:06:48,974 --> 00:06:53,741
Billy, we're a small-market team, and you're a small-market GM.

86
00:06:53,945 --> 00:06:58,780
I'm asking you to be okay not spending money that I don't have.

87
00:06:59,251 --> 00:07:01,446
And I'm asking you to take a deep breath,

88
00:07:01,653 --> 00:07:05,145
shake off the loss, get back in a room with your guys,

89
00:07:05,357 --> 00:07:08,849
and figure out how to find replacements for the guys we lost

90
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,925
with the money that we do have.

91
00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:16,431
I'm not leaving here. I'm not... I can't leave here with that.

92
00:07:17,369 --> 00:07:19,633
What else can I help you with?

93
00:07:30,782 --> 00:07:33,216
It's a good offer, and you gotta match it. L...

94
00:07:33,418 --> 00:07:35,045
I need another day.

95
00:07:35,253 --> 00:07:38,017
His mind's pretty made up. I just think you should know that.

96
00:07:39,424 --> 00:07:42,450
I got a call. I'll get you back. I'll let him know.

97
00:07:42,661 --> 00:07:44,288
Bye.

98
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,227
Yeah? Billy, Scott.

99
00:07:47,432 --> 00:07:49,798
Just got off the phone with Dan. You didn't.

100
00:07:50,001 --> 00:07:51,525
I was surprised he called me.

101
00:07:51,736 --> 00:07:54,830
Stop. I got Johnny for 7.5 or he doesn't play anywhere else.

102
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:59,807
That's the deal you made. Boston just upped it to 7. 75.

103
00:08:01,713 --> 00:08:03,203
You there?

104
00:08:04,716 --> 00:08:08,777
We had a deal, Scott. We haVe a deal, if it's 8 million.

105
00:08:08,987 --> 00:08:12,184
Oh, man, you played me. I'm just doing my job for my client.

106
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:15,018
No, you're playing me, and you're still playing me.

107
00:08:15,226 --> 00:08:17,786
Congratulations, asshole. You win.

108
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,838
I like guys that got a little hair on their ass.

109
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:30,803
He looks like a Mantle or a Mays, quite frankly.

110
00:08:31,009 --> 00:08:33,739
He's got a baseball body. Matty, who do you got?

111
00:08:33,945 --> 00:08:35,879
I like Geronimo. Yes.

112
00:08:36,081 --> 00:08:39,448
The guy's an athlete. Big, fast, talented.

113
00:08:39,651 --> 00:08:41,676
Top of my list. Clean-cut, good face.

114
00:08:41,886 --> 00:08:43,547
Yeah, good jaw. Five-tools guy.

115
00:08:43,755 --> 00:08:45,689
Good-Iooking ballplayer. Can he hit?

116
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:48,984
He's got a beautiful swing. The ball explodes off his bat.

117
00:08:49,194 --> 00:08:52,288
He throws the club head at the ball, and when he connects,

118
00:08:52,497 --> 00:08:54,692
he drives it, it pops off the bat.

119
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:58,164
You can hear it all over the ballpark. A lot of pop.

120
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:00,395
If he's good, why doesn't he hit good?

121
00:09:00,605 --> 00:09:02,539
He is a good hitter. He'll be ready.

122
00:09:02,741 --> 00:09:05,403
He's gonna be a good hitter against big-league arms?

123
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:07,373
Could be great. I don't think so.

124
00:09:07,579 --> 00:09:10,844
Kid needs at bats. Give him 400 at bats, he's gonna get better.

125
00:09:11,049 --> 00:09:12,038
He can play.

126
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,115
He's hit everywhere along the line.

127
00:09:14,319 --> 00:09:15,843
He's one of our guys.

128
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,684
Okay, let's move on.

129
00:09:23,895 --> 00:09:28,298
Artie, who do you like? I like Perez. He's got a classic swing.

130
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,936
It's a real clean stroke. I don't know. Can't hit the curveball.

131
00:09:32,137 --> 00:09:35,595
There's some work to be done, I'll admit that, but he's noticeable.

132
00:09:35,807 --> 00:09:38,071
Got an ugly girlfriend. What's that mean?

133
00:09:38,276 --> 00:09:40,301
Ugly girlfriend means no confidence.

134
00:09:40,512 --> 00:09:43,777
You are full of it. Artie is right. This guy's got an attitude.

135
00:09:43,982 --> 00:09:45,210
An attitude is good.

136
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:48,853
He walks in a room, his dick's already been there for two minutes.

137
00:09:49,053 --> 00:09:51,283
He passes the eye-candy test. Got the looks.

138
00:09:51,489 --> 00:09:54,390
He's ready to play the part. He just needs playing time.

139
00:09:54,592 --> 00:09:57,186
I'm just saying, his girlfriend is a six at best.

140
00:09:57,395 --> 00:10:00,489
Look, if we're trying to replace Giambi, this guy could be it.

141
00:10:00,698 --> 00:10:03,030
I agree with you. La-la-la-la-la.

142
00:10:04,936 --> 00:10:07,461
Damn, Billy, was that a suggestion?

143
00:10:08,173 --> 00:10:10,403
Guys, you're just talking.

144
00:10:10,608 --> 00:10:14,476
Talking, "la-la-la-la-la," like this is business as usual.

145
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:16,112
It's not.

146
00:10:16,948 --> 00:10:18,711
We're trying to solve the problem.

147
00:10:18,917 --> 00:10:21,408
Not like this. You're not looking at the problem.

148
00:10:21,619 --> 00:10:23,712
We're very aware of the problem. I mean...

149
00:10:23,922 --> 00:10:26,390
Okay, good. What's the problem?

150
00:10:30,528 --> 00:10:34,988
Look, Billy, we all understand what the problem is. We have to...

151
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,929
Okay, good. What's the problem?

152
00:10:37,135 --> 00:10:39,865
We have to replace three key players in our lineup.

153
00:10:40,071 --> 00:10:41,538
Nope. What's the problem?

154
00:10:41,739 --> 00:10:44,264
We gotta replace these guys with what we have...

155
00:10:44,476 --> 00:10:46,137
No. What's the problem, Barry?

156
00:10:46,344 --> 00:10:49,507
We need 38 home runs, 120 RBIs and 47 doubles to replace.

157
00:10:51,249 --> 00:10:54,685
The problem we're trying to solve is that there are rich teams

158
00:10:54,886 --> 00:10:58,686
and there are poor teams, then there's 50 feet of crap,

159
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:01,051
and then there's us.

160
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,351
It's an unfair game.

161
00:11:07,432 --> 00:11:11,334
And now we've been gutted. We're like organ donors for the rich.

162
00:11:11,536 --> 00:11:14,562
Boston's taken our kidneys, Yankees have taken our heart.

163
00:11:14,772 --> 00:11:16,103
And you guys sit around

164
00:11:16,307 --> 00:11:21,301
talking the same old "good body" nonsense like we're selling jeans.

165
00:11:21,513 --> 00:11:23,708
Like we're looking for Fabio.

166
00:11:23,915 --> 00:11:25,974
We got to think differently.

167
00:11:26,618 --> 00:11:29,644
We are the last dog at the bowl.

168
00:11:29,854 --> 00:11:32,823
You see what happens to the runt of the litter? He dies.

169
00:11:33,858 --> 00:11:36,588
Billy, that's a very touching story and everything,

170
00:11:36,794 --> 00:11:40,161
but I think we're all very much aware of what we're facing.

171
00:11:40,365 --> 00:11:43,266
You have a lot of experience and wisdom in this room.

172
00:11:43,468 --> 00:11:47,564
You need to have a little faith and let us do the job of replacing Giambi.

173
00:11:48,006 --> 00:11:49,997
Is there another first baseman like Giambi?

174
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:51,505
No, not really. No.

175
00:11:51,709 --> 00:11:54,439
If there was, could we afford him? Nope.

176
00:11:54,646 --> 00:11:58,104
Then what the fuck are you talking about, man?

177
00:11:58,816 --> 00:12:01,910
If we try to play like the Yankees in here,

178
00:12:02,453 --> 00:12:04,921
we will lose to the Yankees out there.

179
00:12:06,124 --> 00:12:09,059
Boy, that sounds like fortune-cookie wisdom to me, Billy.

180
00:12:09,661 --> 00:12:12,755
No, that's just logic. Who's Fabio?

181
00:12:12,964 --> 00:12:15,626
He's a shortstop. He's a shortstop from Seattle.

182
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:18,393
Now, this is no time to push the panic button.

183
00:12:18,603 --> 00:12:22,061
Our scouts will find players, Player Development will develop them.

184
00:12:22,273 --> 00:12:24,639
We'll teach them to play Oakland A baseball.

185
00:12:24,842 --> 00:12:27,743
With all due respect, we've been doing this a long time.

186
00:12:27,946 --> 00:12:31,245
Why don't you just let us be responsible for replacing Giambi

187
00:12:31,449 --> 00:12:34,009
with who we know that can play?

188
00:12:48,266 --> 00:12:51,531
Easy power. And loose.

189
00:12:51,736 --> 00:12:53,226
Good face.

190
00:13:03,915 --> 00:13:06,941
This son of a bitch is going in the first round.

191
00:13:07,785 --> 00:13:09,377
You're a premium player, Billy.

192
00:13:09,587 --> 00:13:12,522
You can run, you can field, you can throw, you can hit,

193
00:13:12,724 --> 00:13:14,282
you can hit with power.

194
00:13:14,492 --> 00:13:16,323
That doesn't come along Very often.

195
00:13:16,527 --> 00:13:18,859
This is Tom Martinez, national cross-checker.

196
00:13:19,063 --> 00:13:20,325
How you doing? Billy Beane.

197
00:13:20,531 --> 00:13:21,520
Nice to meet you.

198
00:13:21,733 --> 00:13:25,794
It's been a while since I've seen a five-tool guy that can do everything.

199
00:13:26,304 --> 00:13:29,034
I'm hopeful your interest in professional baseball

200
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,370
is as strong as ours is gonna be in getting you in this upcoming draft.

201
00:13:40,485 --> 00:13:42,077
WOMr. Beane?

202
00:13:43,054 --> 00:13:44,851
Mark is ready to see you now.

203
00:13:51,696 --> 00:13:52,993
How you doing? WOI'm fine.

204
00:13:53,197 --> 00:13:54,186
How are you? Good.

205
00:13:55,667 --> 00:13:57,965
Hey, Billy. Hey, Mark.

206
00:13:58,169 --> 00:14:00,967
Good to see you. Please sit down. You too.

207
00:14:01,773 --> 00:14:05,038
These are the guys. Guys, Billy. Boys.

208
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:07,737
How's it going? All right. How you been?

209
00:14:07,945 --> 00:14:11,813
You're filling out that chair nicely. I got three weeks in it right now.

210
00:14:12,016 --> 00:14:13,005
Good, good, man.

211
00:14:13,217 --> 00:14:15,685
Yeah, man. How you doing? Fantastic.

212
00:14:15,887 --> 00:14:17,445
Awesome. Couldn't be better.

213
00:14:17,655 --> 00:14:20,317
That's good to hear. I'm not gonna waste your time.

214
00:14:20,525 --> 00:14:22,618
You just tell me what you're looking for.

215
00:14:22,827 --> 00:14:25,091
Fifty million dollars in additional payroll.

216
00:14:25,296 --> 00:14:26,695
You should try Giambi.

217
00:14:26,898 --> 00:14:28,661
Ouch. I'm sorry. Too soon, right?

218
00:14:28,866 --> 00:14:31,027
I want this to be a friendly meeting.

219
00:14:31,235 --> 00:14:32,827
It's not all on your shoulders.

220
00:14:33,037 --> 00:14:35,028
Where's Steve in this? Steve's great.

221
00:14:35,239 --> 00:14:37,264
He's supportive in rebuilding this team.

222
00:14:37,475 --> 00:14:38,942
That's what we're gonna do.

223
00:14:39,143 --> 00:14:42,078
So, what are you looking for? A left-handed reliever.

224
00:14:42,647 --> 00:14:45,115
I'm thinking Ricardo Rincon.

225
00:14:45,917 --> 00:14:47,407
That's not gonna happen.

226
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,715
Not even a discussion?

227
00:14:50,922 --> 00:14:55,882
Billy, even if you could afford him, respectfully, we love him.

228
00:14:56,094 --> 00:14:58,028
We're not about to let him go.

229
00:14:58,262 --> 00:15:00,196
You got this Venezuelan kid coming up.

230
00:15:00,398 --> 00:15:02,696
We had him. We moved him to Detroit.

231
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,460
Huh. What else you thinking?

232
00:15:06,671 --> 00:15:08,195
Outfielders.

233
00:15:08,406 --> 00:15:11,068
To replace Damon? Yeah.

234
00:15:11,275 --> 00:15:15,075
In your price range? No disrespect. Enough, Mark.

235
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,577
Uh... Hollins?

236
00:15:18,349 --> 00:15:19,714
Uh-uh.

237
00:15:20,718 --> 00:15:23,243
Garcia? No.

238
00:15:23,454 --> 00:15:25,149
Maybe Coste.

239
00:15:25,923 --> 00:15:27,356
Uh-uh.

240
00:15:28,126 --> 00:15:29,650
That's it.

241
00:15:31,028 --> 00:15:34,293
All right, tell me about Garcia. To replace Johnny Damon?

242
00:15:34,999 --> 00:15:37,968
Mark, is he healthy? Yeah, he's healthy-ish.

243
00:15:38,169 --> 00:15:40,603
He had that back thing.

244
00:15:40,805 --> 00:15:43,535
He'll be ready for spring ball. I'll tell you what.

245
00:15:43,741 --> 00:15:46,209
I can give you Guthrie if you kick in some cash.

246
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:47,434
Mark Guthrie? Yeah.

247
00:15:47,645 --> 00:15:49,738
How much cash? Two hundred K.

248
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:07,495
Okay.

249
00:16:08,533 --> 00:16:12,333
So Garcia's gonna be a no. You're kidding me, right?

250
00:16:13,304 --> 00:16:15,602
You're kidding me. I'm not.

251
00:16:17,308 --> 00:16:20,539
Okay. Straight up, Garcia for Guthrie, no kicker.

252
00:16:21,612 --> 00:16:24,206
No kicker? Straight up.

253
00:16:27,585 --> 00:16:32,147
I think it's gonna be a hard no on Garcia, but let's just keep going.

254
00:16:32,356 --> 00:16:35,553
What else you thinking? What are we doing? Is this business?

255
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,990
This is the way we do business in Cleveland.

256
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,204
Hey.

257
00:17:24,442 --> 00:17:26,933
Hello. Who are you?

258
00:17:29,814 --> 00:17:31,748
I'm Peter Brand.

259
00:17:32,683 --> 00:17:34,378
What do you do?

260
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,345
I'm special assistant to Mark Shapiro.

261
00:17:38,556 --> 00:17:40,387
So, what do you do?

262
00:17:42,793 --> 00:17:46,229
Mostly player analysis right now.

263
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:50,127
Been on the job long? First job in baseball?

264
00:17:51,602 --> 00:17:53,968
It's my first job anywhere.

265
00:17:54,171 --> 00:17:56,571
Wow, congrats. Thank you.

266
00:17:56,774 --> 00:17:59,368
First job. Whose nephew are you?

267
00:18:01,812 --> 00:18:03,609
Why does Mark listen to you?

268
00:18:06,284 --> 00:18:08,616
I don't think, uh...

269
00:18:08,819 --> 00:18:11,151
I don't think he does very often.

270
00:18:12,623 --> 00:18:14,488
He just did.

271
00:18:16,594 --> 00:18:18,084
Well, in that circumstance,

272
00:18:18,296 --> 00:18:21,823
I think he was more listening to Bruce than myself.

273
00:18:22,266 --> 00:18:24,826
Mm-hm. Who are you?

274
00:18:27,571 --> 00:18:29,766
I'm Peter Brand.

275
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:35,836
I don't give a rat's ass what your name is.

276
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,707
What happened in there?

277
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:42,114
What happened in that room?

278
00:18:42,586 --> 00:18:45,248
I'm not quite sure what you're asking me, Mr. Beane.

279
00:18:45,456 --> 00:18:47,856
What did you tell Bruce?

280
00:18:49,026 --> 00:18:53,520
I just told Bruce I like Garcia. You like Garcia. Why?

281
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:57,494
Why?

282
00:19:02,606 --> 00:19:05,131
I don't know. Ahem.

283
00:19:21,726 --> 00:19:24,593
There is an epidemic failure within the game

284
00:19:24,795 --> 00:19:27,355
to understand what is really happening.

285
00:19:27,565 --> 00:19:32,002
And this leads people who run Major League Baseball teams

286
00:19:32,203 --> 00:19:36,333
to misjudge their players and mismanage their teams.

287
00:19:40,978 --> 00:19:42,912
I apologize.

288
00:19:43,881 --> 00:19:44,870
Go on.

289
00:19:48,185 --> 00:19:53,316
Okay. People who run ball clubs, they think in terms of buying players.

290
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:58,486
Your goal shouldn't be to buy players. Your goal should be to buy wins.

291
00:19:58,696 --> 00:20:02,029
And in order to buy wins, you need to buy runs.

292
00:20:02,233 --> 00:20:04,258
You're trying to replace Johnny Damon.

293
00:20:04,769 --> 00:20:06,361
The Red Sox see Johnny Damon

294
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:10,199
and they see a star who's worth $7.5 million a year.

295
00:20:10,408 --> 00:20:13,275
When I see Johnny Damon,

296
00:20:13,477 --> 00:20:15,775
what I see is...

297
00:20:17,214 --> 00:20:20,615
an imperfect understanding of where runs come from.

298
00:20:21,352 --> 00:20:22,910
The guy's got a great gloVe.

299
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,055
He's a decent leadoff hitter. He can steal bases.

300
00:20:26,257 --> 00:20:28,589
But is he worth the $ 7.5 million a year

301
00:20:28,793 --> 00:20:30,920
that the Boston Red Sox are paying him?

302
00:20:31,128 --> 00:20:32,959
No. No.

303
00:20:33,564 --> 00:20:35,395
Baseball thinking is medieVal.

304
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:38,067
They are asking all the wrong questions.

305
00:20:38,269 --> 00:20:42,399
And if I say it to anybody, I'm ostracized. I'm a leper.

306
00:20:42,606 --> 00:20:47,543
So that's why I'm cagey about this with you.

307
00:20:47,745 --> 00:20:48,734
That's why...

308
00:20:48,946 --> 00:20:52,848
I respect you, Mr. Beane, and if you want full disclosure,

309
00:20:53,484 --> 00:20:57,887
I think it's a good thing that you got Damon off your payroll.

310
00:20:58,089 --> 00:21:02,583
I think it opens up all kinds of interesting possibilities.

311
00:21:02,793 --> 00:21:05,853
Where you from, Pete? Maryland.

312
00:21:06,063 --> 00:21:09,328
Where'd you go to school? Yale. I went to Yale.

313
00:21:10,468 --> 00:21:13,335
What'd you study? Economics.

314
00:21:14,038 --> 00:21:16,529
I studied economics.

315
00:21:20,111 --> 00:21:24,445
Yale, economics and baseball.

316
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:28,245
You're funny, Pete.

317
00:21:51,175 --> 00:21:52,369
Tell me, why Billy?

318
00:21:53,144 --> 00:21:55,476
What is it that makes him special?

319
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,342
Very rare do you come upon a young man like Billy

320
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:02,644
who can run, who can field, who can throw, who can hit,

321
00:22:02,853 --> 00:22:04,411
and who can hit with power.

322
00:22:04,622 --> 00:22:07,614
Those five tools, you don't see that very often.

323
00:22:08,325 --> 00:22:11,192
Most of the youngsters that we have an interest in

324
00:22:11,395 --> 00:22:12,828
have one or two tools,

325
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:15,624
and we're hoping to develop an extra one.

326
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:17,733
Your son has five.

327
00:22:17,935 --> 00:22:21,928
We're looking at a guy that's a potential superstar for us in New York.

328
00:22:22,139 --> 00:22:23,970
The time is now to get him started.

329
00:22:24,175 --> 00:22:26,973
We're prepared to make a sizable financial commitment.

330
00:22:27,178 --> 00:22:29,544
The Mets are gonna stand behind Billy

331
00:22:29,747 --> 00:22:33,046
because we expect him to be our big-league center fielder.

332
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,309
This check here represents the offer

333
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:38,852
that the New York Mets would be making to Billy.

334
00:22:39,056 --> 00:22:44,153
You do know that he's been accepted to Stanford on a full scholarship?

335
00:22:44,361 --> 00:22:45,487
I do.

336
00:22:45,696 --> 00:22:48,096
So he can do both?

337
00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:52,599
Unfortunately, he can't do Stanford and professional baseball.

338
00:22:52,803 --> 00:22:56,671
He would have to pick one or the other.

339
00:22:56,874 --> 00:22:59,342
If he wants to be center fielder for the Mets,

340
00:22:59,543 --> 00:23:01,374
wants to be a baseball player,

341
00:23:01,579 --> 00:23:06,448
he really needs to accept this as life's first occupation, first career.

342
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:10,347
We're all told at some point we can no longer play the children's game.

343
00:23:10,554 --> 00:23:13,022
We just don't know when that's gonna be.

344
00:23:13,557 --> 00:23:17,584
Some of us are told at 18, some of us are told at 40, but we're all told.

345
00:23:18,262 --> 00:23:21,459
But this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

346
00:23:21,665 --> 00:23:26,193
We want you badly, and we think that this amount of money expresses that desire.

347
00:23:26,403 --> 00:23:29,736
Billy, this is your decision, and whatever that decision is,

348
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:32,408
you know it's fine with your mother and I.

349
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,550
Hello? Hey, it's Billy Beane.

350
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:50,121
Hey, what time is it? I don't know.

351
00:23:51,128 --> 00:23:55,258
Listen, would you have drafted me in the first round?

352
00:23:55,466 --> 00:23:56,865
What?

353
00:23:57,067 --> 00:24:00,559
After I left, you looked me up on your computer.

354
00:24:00,771 --> 00:24:03,069
Would you have drafted me in the first round?

355
00:24:03,274 --> 00:24:06,175
I did, yeah. You were a good player.

356
00:24:06,377 --> 00:24:08,572
Cut the crap, man.

357
00:24:08,779 --> 00:24:11,680
Would you have drafted me in the first round?

358
00:24:12,383 --> 00:24:16,513
I'd haVe taken you in the ninth round. No signing bonus.

359
00:24:17,354 --> 00:24:21,814
I imagine you would'Ve passed and taken that scholarship.

360
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,424
Yeah.

361
00:24:28,065 --> 00:24:30,499
Pack your bags, Pete.

362
00:24:30,968 --> 00:24:33,960
I just bought you from the Cleveland Indians.

363
00:24:47,751 --> 00:24:51,209
Is it attached to that clamp? Yeah, let me unhook it.

364
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:00,895
Slide it up right there.

365
00:25:01,098 --> 00:25:02,292
To the left. I did.

366
00:25:02,499 --> 00:25:04,524
Yeah, yeah. Hang on, it's wet.

367
00:25:04,735 --> 00:25:06,293
Come on.

368
00:25:28,092 --> 00:25:29,684
Morning, Suzanne. Coffee on? Yes.

369
00:25:29,893 --> 00:25:30,882
Great.

370
00:25:32,329 --> 00:25:33,887
Billy Beane's office. Hey.

371
00:25:34,098 --> 00:25:35,087
Peter Brand. Billy.

372
00:25:35,299 --> 00:25:37,767
How are...? Hi, how you doing? Nice to see you.

373
00:25:37,968 --> 00:25:40,493
Good to have you here. Boy, you move in fast.

374
00:25:40,704 --> 00:25:42,672
Yeah, yeah. I got here early this morning.

375
00:25:42,873 --> 00:25:44,966
Wow. Huh.

376
00:25:45,175 --> 00:25:47,200
All moved in. Yeah.

377
00:25:47,945 --> 00:25:49,503
Yeah.

378
00:25:49,713 --> 00:25:51,681
Hey, Billy,

379
00:25:51,882 --> 00:25:54,749
I wanted you to see these player evaluations

380
00:25:54,952 --> 00:25:57,079
that you asked me to do.

381
00:25:58,088 --> 00:25:59,680
I asked you to do three.

382
00:26:00,624 --> 00:26:01,955
Yeah.

383
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,684
To evaluate three players. Yeah.

384
00:26:04,895 --> 00:26:06,829
How many did you do?

385
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,964
Forty-seven.

386
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,390
Okay.

387
00:26:12,336 --> 00:26:16,033
Actually, 51. I don't know why I lied just then.

388
00:26:25,082 --> 00:26:27,482
Why don't you walk me through the board?

389
00:26:28,952 --> 00:26:30,510
Thank you.

390
00:26:56,814 --> 00:26:58,839
Using this equation in the upper left,

391
00:26:59,049 --> 00:27:02,109
I'm projecting that we need to win at least 99 games

392
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:04,446
in order to make it to the postseason.

393
00:27:04,655 --> 00:27:08,751
We need to score at least 814 runs in order to win those games

394
00:27:08,959 --> 00:27:11,985
and allow no more than 645 runs.

395
00:27:17,167 --> 00:27:18,429
What's this?

396
00:27:18,635 --> 00:27:22,196
This is a code that I'Ve written for our year-to-year projections.

397
00:27:22,406 --> 00:27:26,001
This is building in the intelligence that we haVe to project players.

398
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:27,199
Okay.

399
00:27:27,411 --> 00:27:30,005
It's about getting things down to one number.

400
00:27:30,514 --> 00:27:33,039
Using the stats the way we read them,

401
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:36,344
we'll find Value in players that nobody else can see.

402
00:27:39,923 --> 00:27:41,185
People are oVerlooked

403
00:27:41,391 --> 00:27:45,157
for a Variety of biased reasons and perceiVed flaws.

404
00:27:45,362 --> 00:27:48,627
Age, appearance, personality.

405
00:27:48,832 --> 00:27:53,531
Bill James and mathematics cut straight through that.

406
00:27:55,172 --> 00:27:58,437
Billy, of the 20,000 notable players for us to consider,

407
00:27:58,642 --> 00:28:01,133
I believe that there is a championship team

408
00:28:01,345 --> 00:28:04,473
of 25 people that we can afford,

409
00:28:04,681 --> 00:28:07,809
because everyone else in baseball undervalues them.

410
00:28:08,018 --> 00:28:11,249
Like an island of misfit toys.

411
00:28:15,726 --> 00:28:18,923
Billy, this is chad Bradford. He's a relief pitcher.

412
00:28:19,129 --> 00:28:23,361
He is one of the most undervalued players in baseball.

413
00:28:23,567 --> 00:28:26,502
His defect is that he throws funny.

414
00:28:27,371 --> 00:28:31,398
Nobody in the big leagues cares about him because he looks funny.

415
00:28:31,608 --> 00:28:34,668
This guy could be not just the best pitcher in our pen,

416
00:28:34,878 --> 00:28:38,245
but one of the most effectiVe relief pitchers in all baseball.

417
00:28:38,448 --> 00:28:41,178
This guy should cost $3 million a year.

418
00:28:41,385 --> 00:28:44,218
We can get him for 237,000.

419
00:29:08,178 --> 00:29:09,577
Billy.

420
00:29:11,114 --> 00:29:13,514
That it? Yeah.

421
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,011
Hey, Art.

422
00:29:45,215 --> 00:29:47,376
Can I talk to you before you get started?

423
00:29:47,584 --> 00:29:49,984
I'm a bit busy right now. I know.

424
00:29:51,922 --> 00:29:53,446
I know. Okay.

425
00:29:53,657 --> 00:29:55,284
Morning, everyone. Art.

426
00:29:55,492 --> 00:29:58,723
Peter Brand. Nice to meet you. Where the hell's Pete?

427
00:29:58,929 --> 00:29:59,953
That's Pete.

428
00:30:00,897 --> 00:30:03,365
Grab a seat. I'll be right back.

429
00:30:04,501 --> 00:30:06,526
All right, where did you say he's at?

430
00:30:06,737 --> 00:30:07,761
Okay. He's on...

431
00:30:08,505 --> 00:30:11,133
Who's the kid? A friend of mine.

432
00:30:12,943 --> 00:30:15,844
I can't manage this team under a one-year contract.

433
00:30:16,046 --> 00:30:17,809
Well, sure you can.

434
00:30:19,549 --> 00:30:21,642
No, I can't.

435
00:30:21,852 --> 00:30:24,377
Okay. I gotta put a team on the field.

436
00:30:24,588 --> 00:30:28,024
After that, I'll take a good long look at your contract.

437
00:30:28,225 --> 00:30:31,490
Deal with the manager's contract, then put a team on the field.

438
00:30:31,695 --> 00:30:36,064
At this moment, if a grounder's hit to first, nobody's there to stop it.

439
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:41,234
It's not easy doing what I do under the cloud of a one-year contract.

440
00:30:41,438 --> 00:30:42,803
Okay, I understand that.

441
00:30:43,006 --> 00:30:44,940
I've been there. I know you have.

442
00:30:45,142 --> 00:30:49,545
A one-year contract means the same thing to a manager as to a player.

443
00:30:49,746 --> 00:30:51,907
There's not a lot of faith there.

444
00:30:52,115 --> 00:30:54,845
Which is strange after a 102-win season.

445
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:57,853
I see.

446
00:30:58,055 --> 00:31:02,355
If you lose the last game of the season, nobody gives a shit.

447
00:31:04,461 --> 00:31:08,227
So it's on me now? No, Art, it's on me.

448
00:31:08,432 --> 00:31:11,731
And the kid is the new assistant GM.

449
00:31:11,935 --> 00:31:13,926
Okay. Okay, fellas.

450
00:31:14,137 --> 00:31:15,729
Hey, Billy.

451
00:31:26,149 --> 00:31:28,845
You can't deny his offensive output. He can play.

452
00:31:29,052 --> 00:31:32,021
And we need people that can play.

453
00:31:38,261 --> 00:31:40,593
Who do you wanna talk about first?

454
00:31:57,414 --> 00:31:59,382
None of them.

455
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:03,085
Billy, we got 38 home runs, 120 RBIs to make up for.

456
00:32:03,286 --> 00:32:05,618
Guys, you're still trying to replace Giambi.

457
00:32:05,822 --> 00:32:09,280
I told you we can't do it, and we can't do it.

458
00:32:09,893 --> 00:32:14,057
Now, what we might be able to do is re-create him.

459
00:32:14,264 --> 00:32:17,233
Re-create him in the aggregate. The what?

460
00:32:17,434 --> 00:32:20,164
Giambi's on-base percentage was.477.

461
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:24,773
Damon's on-base, .324. And Olmedo's was.291.

462
00:32:24,975 --> 00:32:27,170
Add that up and you get...

463
00:32:29,846 --> 00:32:31,108
Do you want me to speak?

464
00:32:32,182 --> 00:32:34,013
When I point at you, yeah.

465
00:32:34,217 --> 00:32:36,185
1.092. Divided by three.

466
00:32:37,587 --> 00:32:40,055
.364. That's what we're looking for.

467
00:32:40,257 --> 00:32:44,353
Three ballplayers... Three ballplayers whose average OBP is...

468
00:32:44,561 --> 00:32:45,858
.364.

469
00:32:46,062 --> 00:32:48,895
Wait, that doesn't come out right. It's right, Artie.

470
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:51,328
Billy. You gotta carry the one.

471
00:32:51,535 --> 00:32:53,901
Billy. Scratch this out.

472
00:32:54,104 --> 00:32:55,128
Yeah?

473
00:32:55,338 --> 00:32:56,896
Who's that?

474
00:32:57,107 --> 00:32:58,699
That's Pete.

475
00:32:59,643 --> 00:33:02,168
Does Pete really need to be here?

476
00:33:02,379 --> 00:33:03,368
Yes, he does.

477
00:33:05,015 --> 00:33:07,347
Okay, here's who we want.

478
00:33:07,551 --> 00:33:10,782
Jason's little brother, Jeremy.

479
00:33:10,987 --> 00:33:13,820
Oh, God. Billy, that's trouble.

480
00:33:14,024 --> 00:33:18,893
Billy, look, if l... Yeah. Billy, if I may, he's had his problems off the field,

481
00:33:19,095 --> 00:33:21,393
and we know what he can't do on the field.

482
00:33:21,598 --> 00:33:23,463
He's getting thick around the waist.

483
00:33:23,667 --> 00:33:26,295
There's reports about him on weed, in strip clubs.

484
00:33:26,503 --> 00:33:29,131
His on-base percentage is all we're looking at now.

485
00:33:29,339 --> 00:33:34,709
And Jeremy gets on base an awful lot for a guy who only costs 285,000.

486
00:33:34,911 --> 00:33:37,880
Jeez, Billy... Number two:

487
00:33:39,549 --> 00:33:41,380
David Justice. Oh, no.

488
00:33:41,585 --> 00:33:43,450
His legs are gone. Not a good idea.

489
00:33:43,653 --> 00:33:45,211
Old Man Justice? Why is that?

490
00:33:45,422 --> 00:33:50,519
Steinbrenner's so pissed at his decline, he's willing to eat his contract to get rid of him.

491
00:33:50,727 --> 00:33:53,423
Exactly. Ten years ago, Justice, big name.

492
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:54,619
Been in big games.

493
00:33:54,831 --> 00:33:58,028
He's gonna really help our season tickets early in the year,

494
00:33:58,235 --> 00:34:02,831
but in the dog days in July, August, we're lucky if he's gonna hit his weight.

495
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:06,668
Billy, his legs are gone, and he's a defensive liability.

496
00:34:06,877 --> 00:34:09,004
I question whether the bat speed's there.

497
00:34:09,212 --> 00:34:10,645
His legs are gone. Grady.

498
00:34:10,847 --> 00:34:14,715
We'll be lucky to get 60 games out of him. Why do you like him?

499
00:34:15,819 --> 00:34:17,081
Because he gets on base.

500
00:34:18,989 --> 00:34:20,684
What is this? What are we doing?

501
00:34:20,891 --> 00:34:22,916
Okay, number three:

502
00:34:28,832 --> 00:34:30,697
Scott Hatteberg. Who?

503
00:34:30,901 --> 00:34:31,925
Hatteberg? Exactly.

504
00:34:32,135 --> 00:34:33,966
He sounds like an Oakland A already.

505
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:38,129
Yes, he's had a little problem with... Little problem? He can't throw.

506
00:34:38,341 --> 00:34:41,970
He's a career.260 hitter. The best part of his career is over.

507
00:34:42,178 --> 00:34:44,908
It's just getting started. Boston wants to cut him.

508
00:34:45,115 --> 00:34:47,606
No one wants to pick him up. Good. He's cheap.

509
00:34:47,817 --> 00:34:50,445
Let me get this straight. You're gonna get a guy

510
00:34:50,654 --> 00:34:53,953
that's been released by half the organizations in baseball

511
00:34:54,157 --> 00:34:58,287
because he's got nonrepairable nerve damage in his elbow and can't throw.

512
00:34:58,495 --> 00:35:01,828
He can't throw and he can't field. But what can he do?

513
00:35:02,032 --> 00:35:03,021
Oh, boy.

514
00:35:03,233 --> 00:35:05,599
Check your reports or I'm gonna point at Pete.

515
00:35:05,802 --> 00:35:08,270
He gets on base. He can get on base.

516
00:35:08,471 --> 00:35:11,031
So he walks a lot. He gets on base a lot, Rocco.

517
00:35:11,241 --> 00:35:13,835
Do I care if it's a walk or a hit?

518
00:35:14,044 --> 00:35:15,375
Pete?

519
00:35:15,578 --> 00:35:17,773
You do not. I do not.

520
00:35:17,981 --> 00:35:21,007
I got 37 free agents that are better than those three guys.

521
00:35:21,217 --> 00:35:23,412
Wait a minute, let me get this straight.

522
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:26,248
So you're not gonna bring in one

523
00:35:26,456 --> 00:35:29,755
but three defective players to replace Giambi?

524
00:35:30,493 --> 00:35:32,927
You're not buying into this Bill James bullshit?

525
00:35:33,129 --> 00:35:35,097
This is the new direction of the A's.

526
00:35:35,298 --> 00:35:38,165
We are card counters at the blackjack table

527
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:41,064
and we're gonna turn the odds on the casino.

528
00:35:42,439 --> 00:35:44,134
I don't see it. Seriously, guys.

529
00:35:44,341 --> 00:35:47,003
I think we have to remember this is the man.

530
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:52,614
He answers to no one except ownership and God.

531
00:35:52,816 --> 00:35:55,649
And he doesn't have to answer to us.

532
00:35:55,852 --> 00:35:58,252
We make suggestions, he makes decisions.

533
00:35:58,455 --> 00:36:01,822
That's all fine and well, but we've been working our asses off

534
00:36:02,025 --> 00:36:05,825
for weeks to make this club better, and you're shitting all over it.

535
00:36:06,029 --> 00:36:08,497
This is not a discussion.

536
00:36:10,867 --> 00:36:12,198
What are we discussing?

537
00:36:12,402 --> 00:36:14,233
Barry, not a discussion.

538
00:36:19,242 --> 00:36:22,109
Billy, man, um,

539
00:36:22,746 --> 00:36:24,805
there's one thing you're forgetting.

540
00:36:25,448 --> 00:36:30,147
None of those three guys knows how to play first base.

541
00:36:30,353 --> 00:36:32,651
Well, you're gonna have to teach one of them.

542
00:36:32,856 --> 00:36:34,221
Teach?

543
00:36:35,392 --> 00:36:37,053
Which one?

544
00:36:48,638 --> 00:36:52,699
This is really the kickoff to the holiday season here in downtown Seattle.

545
00:36:52,909 --> 00:36:57,278
It took weeks of planning to lead up to the big event, but it was well worth it.

546
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:00,881
The weather was ideal. People are still haVing a great time.

547
00:37:01,084 --> 00:37:02,949
Thousands of people were out earlier.

548
00:37:03,153 --> 00:37:04,745
We haVe a nice recap for you

549
00:37:04,954 --> 00:37:08,412
of all the great events taking place downtown in Seattle...

550
00:37:12,529 --> 00:37:14,087
Hello? Scott?

551
00:37:14,297 --> 00:37:15,286
Yes.

552
00:37:15,498 --> 00:37:18,467
It's Billy Beane of the Oakland A 's. Yes.

553
00:37:18,668 --> 00:37:21,501
Can we talk? Uh, yeah.

554
00:37:21,704 --> 00:37:23,604
Do you wanna let us in?

555
00:37:24,641 --> 00:37:27,166
Pardon me? We're out front.

556
00:37:28,645 --> 00:37:30,772
What? On the curb.

557
00:37:31,014 --> 00:37:32,743
Uh, yeah, yeah.

558
00:37:34,717 --> 00:37:35,741
Honey?

559
00:37:40,156 --> 00:37:42,124
Oh, thank you. Thank you, ma'am.

560
00:37:42,325 --> 00:37:43,986
Very kind.

561
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:49,327
How's the elbow, Scott?

562
00:37:49,532 --> 00:37:53,525
You know, it's good. It's really good. It's great. Uh...

563
00:37:59,409 --> 00:38:01,468
I can't throw the ball at all. Yeah.

564
00:38:01,678 --> 00:38:04,374
You've thrown your last ball from behind home plate.

565
00:38:04,581 --> 00:38:06,742
That's what I'd say. Well...

566
00:38:07,484 --> 00:38:10,749
Good news is, we want you at first.

567
00:38:18,094 --> 00:38:21,586
We want you to play first base for the Oakland A's.

568
00:38:22,799 --> 00:38:24,960
Okay, well,

569
00:38:25,168 --> 00:38:26,897
I've only ever played catcher.

570
00:38:27,103 --> 00:38:29,537
Scott, you're not a catcher anymore.

571
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:34,041
If you were, our call wouldn't have been the only one you got.

572
00:38:34,978 --> 00:38:39,108
Yeah. Hey, listen, no, I appreciate it. You're welcome.

573
00:38:39,315 --> 00:38:44,014
But the thing is, is... You don't know how to play first base.

574
00:38:44,654 --> 00:38:45,712
Scott. That's right.

575
00:38:46,222 --> 00:38:47,780
It's not that hard, Scott.

576
00:38:47,991 --> 00:38:50,152
Tell him, Wash. It's incredibly hard.

577
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:53,488
Hey, anything worth doing is. And we're gonna teach you.

578
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:55,994
Wait a minute here. I mean, but what about...?

579
00:38:56,199 --> 00:38:58,292
Jason's gone, Scott.

580
00:38:58,801 --> 00:39:01,292
You want me to take Giambi's spot at first base?

581
00:39:01,504 --> 00:39:02,732
Yeah. What about the fans?

582
00:39:02,939 --> 00:39:06,397
Maybe I can teach one of them. The fans don't... Good one.

583
00:39:06,609 --> 00:39:07,940
Fans don't run my ball club.

584
00:39:08,144 --> 00:39:10,305
Honey, what are you doing awake?

585
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,071
Sweetheart, can you?

586
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:16,013
That's my daughter.

587
00:39:17,453 --> 00:39:19,353
You got kids?

588
00:39:20,256 --> 00:39:22,156
Uh, yeah, a daughter.

589
00:39:22,358 --> 00:39:26,761
Scott, this is a contract to play ball for the Oakland A's.

590
00:39:26,963 --> 00:39:28,988
A copy's been sent over to your agent.

591
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:32,032
Discuss with your wife, let us know.

592
00:39:33,102 --> 00:39:34,296
Thank you.

593
00:39:34,504 --> 00:39:35,732
Bye-bye. Bye.

594
00:39:35,939 --> 00:39:37,907
Oh, and, Scott. Yeah?

595
00:39:38,107 --> 00:39:40,132
Don't tell anyone about the first-base thing.

596
00:39:40,343 --> 00:39:41,605
Yes, sir. Okay.

597
00:39:41,811 --> 00:39:44,245
Happy holidays. All right.

598
00:40:09,906 --> 00:40:11,134
Hey, Sharon. Hi, Billy.

599
00:40:11,341 --> 00:40:14,538
Is she ready? She's out with friends.

600
00:40:15,678 --> 00:40:17,737
But she'll be back. Come in.

601
00:40:18,514 --> 00:40:20,812
Okay. Yeah, she's right here. Hold on.

602
00:40:21,017 --> 00:40:22,314
Here you go.

603
00:40:24,454 --> 00:40:28,049
Here, wanna have a seat? Yeah.

604
00:40:36,733 --> 00:40:38,963
You good, Billy? Yeah. How are you, Alan?

605
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:42,535
Good. Really good. Things are peaceful around here.

606
00:40:44,607 --> 00:40:46,632
It's good to see you.

607
00:40:46,843 --> 00:40:48,777
Thanks, Alan.

608
00:40:48,978 --> 00:40:51,071
I haven't got to see you since play-offs.

609
00:40:51,281 --> 00:40:53,749
I wanted to say that New York was heartbreaking.

610
00:40:54,417 --> 00:40:55,782
I'm sure for you too.

611
00:40:55,985 --> 00:40:59,921
Not many teams make it that far, and to watch you go that far was...

612
00:41:00,123 --> 00:41:05,584
It was really an accomplishment. Well, that's nice.

613
00:41:06,462 --> 00:41:08,657
How is the team shaping up?

614
00:41:08,865 --> 00:41:12,596
Team's good. Rebuilding. Good.

615
00:41:12,802 --> 00:41:15,828
I read you lost Giambonni and Damon.

616
00:41:16,039 --> 00:41:17,028
Giambi. Giambi.

617
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,834
Yeah. Damon, Isringhausen.

618
00:41:20,043 --> 00:41:24,002
They're really...? They're gone? Gone. Yesterday's news.

619
00:41:24,213 --> 00:41:27,580
That's terrible. No, but that is a tough situation.

620
00:41:27,784 --> 00:41:29,376
That's...

621
00:41:29,585 --> 00:41:32,918
You're gonna be fine, though. You always figure something out.

622
00:41:36,793 --> 00:41:40,024
Where is she? Where was she? Down the street or?

623
00:41:40,229 --> 00:41:44,188
Oh, sorry, yeah. I just talked to her on her cell. She's coming up the hill.

624
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,662
Okay.

625
00:41:45,868 --> 00:41:48,063
She's got a cell phone?

626
00:41:48,571 --> 00:41:51,131
Yeah. A 12-year-old?

627
00:41:51,341 --> 00:41:52,808
Yeah.

628
00:41:53,409 --> 00:41:54,808
Huh.

629
00:41:55,745 --> 00:41:56,905
For emergencies.

630
00:41:58,915 --> 00:42:01,042
Big parenting decision.

631
00:42:01,584 --> 00:42:05,680
But it's something that, you know, we, you know, all should discuss,

632
00:42:05,888 --> 00:42:09,324
because if you have any objections, of course...

633
00:42:09,525 --> 00:42:11,959
Her mother and I will discuss it.

634
00:42:12,862 --> 00:42:14,523
But thank you.

635
00:42:17,567 --> 00:42:19,831
Any of these? Um...

636
00:42:20,036 --> 00:42:21,503
I don't know.

637
00:42:21,704 --> 00:42:23,695
Do you...? This one's cool.

638
00:42:23,906 --> 00:42:25,430
Is that good or bad?

639
00:42:25,641 --> 00:42:27,506
Butterflies. They're okay.

640
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:30,645
Look, that one's pretty. I like the red.

641
00:42:30,847 --> 00:42:32,405
Should we try?

642
00:42:33,182 --> 00:42:34,444
No?

643
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:36,208
Oh, I like this one. Yeah?

644
00:42:36,419 --> 00:42:37,784
Dad, look at this one.

645
00:42:37,987 --> 00:42:40,217
Look how it's red. It's beautiful.

646
00:42:40,423 --> 00:42:42,755
This one's pretty. Let's try it out.

647
00:42:42,959 --> 00:42:45,325
Just right here? Why don't we go over there?

648
00:42:45,528 --> 00:42:47,018
Can we go over there?

649
00:43:05,615 --> 00:43:09,642
Oh, honey, you need to sing. That's so good.

650
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:12,479
That's beautiful.

651
00:43:14,056 --> 00:43:15,045
Sometimes I sing.

652
00:43:15,258 --> 00:43:20,890
It's fun to sing with your song, but I don't want people to listen to me.

653
00:43:21,097 --> 00:43:24,931
Well, honey, I think people would love to listen to you. That's beautiful.

654
00:43:25,935 --> 00:43:29,029
Would you sing a little for your dad?

655
00:43:29,238 --> 00:43:31,331
Right here in the middle of the store?

656
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:36,576
Little bit. Little bit.

657
00:43:38,381 --> 00:43:40,042
You ready? I'm ready.

658
00:43:40,249 --> 00:43:41,443
Okay.

659
00:43:41,651 --> 00:43:44,449
* I'm just a little bit Caught in the middle *

660
00:43:44,654 --> 00:43:47,316
* Life is a maze And love is a riddle *

661
00:43:47,523 --> 00:43:51,857
* I don't know where to go Can't do it alone, I've tried *

662
00:43:52,061 --> 00:43:53,688
* And I don't know why *

663
00:43:53,896 --> 00:43:56,421
* I'm just a little girl Lost in the moment *

664
00:43:56,632 --> 00:43:59,692
* I'm so scared But I don't show it *

665
00:43:59,902 --> 00:44:03,030
* I can't figure it out It's bringing me down *

666
00:44:03,239 --> 00:44:07,608
* I know I've got to let it go *

667
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:10,677
* And just enjoy the show **

668
00:44:15,952 --> 00:44:19,149
 Billy Beane was taken in the first round of the amateur draft.

669
00:44:19,355 --> 00:44:21,585
I think this is a steal, to get Billy Beane.

670
00:44:21,791 --> 00:44:23,281
He's young, he's talented.

671
00:44:23,493 --> 00:44:27,793
A true fiVe-tool player with speed. This guy is a can't-miss prospect.

672
00:44:27,997 --> 00:44:30,192
This is a great sign for the new York Mets.

673
00:44:30,399 --> 00:44:33,835
 And it could be the turnaround that they'Ve been looking for.

674
00:44:34,303 --> 00:44:35,736
Ball one.

675
00:44:35,938 --> 00:44:38,429
 I'll take Billy Beane oVer Strawberry.

676
00:44:38,641 --> 00:44:42,008
Billy Beane, an interesting pick, turned down a scholarship.

677
00:44:42,211 --> 00:44:43,701
He could'Ve gone to Stanford.

678
00:44:43,913 --> 00:44:47,212
Sometimes you don't find out till you get to the big leagues...

679
00:44:47,416 --> 00:44:48,405
Strike!

680
00:44:48,618 --> 00:44:52,019
This guy has never failed at anything. He's coming out of high school.

681
00:44:52,221 --> 00:44:55,816
Billy was gonna go to college. He could'Ve been a great quarterback.

682
00:45:03,699 --> 00:45:05,530
Strike three.

683
00:45:06,068 --> 00:45:09,367
There's not an organization in baseball

684
00:45:09,572 --> 00:45:14,373
who would not haVe taken a chance on this young guy.

685
00:45:15,978 --> 00:45:19,345
He didn't pan out. That happens every year.

686
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:23,648
Some do, some don't.

687
00:45:24,954 --> 00:45:27,855
I mean, if you're haVing any doubt at all about this...

688
00:45:30,359 --> 00:45:31,792
HaVing the scholarship...

689
00:45:31,994 --> 00:45:35,020
Your son was born with a God-giVen ability.

690
00:45:35,765 --> 00:45:39,394
Few scouts can go into the mind of a young man

691
00:45:39,602 --> 00:45:44,232
and determine whether he's really confident about what he can do.

692
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:46,135
A Very special player.

693
00:45:46,342 --> 00:45:48,902
So you can sign him based on his ability,

694
00:45:49,111 --> 00:45:52,638
but then he's gotta be successful to be confident.

695
00:45:52,848 --> 00:45:57,444
And once he becomes confident, that's when you'Ve got something.

696
00:46:00,957 --> 00:46:04,154
You make a decision on what you see.

697
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:07,852
And if things don't pan out, you moVe on.

698
00:46:08,064 --> 00:46:10,055
That's baseball.

699
00:46:10,266 --> 00:46:12,257
Many are called, few are chosen.

700
00:46:14,136 --> 00:46:18,903
Billy, that is Kevin Youkilis. That is the Greek God of Walks.

701
00:46:19,108 --> 00:46:20,405
That's my hero.

702
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:23,579
That man gets walked more than anybody in baseball

703
00:46:23,779 --> 00:46:25,679
except for Barry Bonds.

704
00:46:25,881 --> 00:46:29,339
I tried to convince Shapiro to pick him up last June,

705
00:46:29,552 --> 00:46:31,884
but he said he waddled like a duck.

706
00:46:32,421 --> 00:46:34,582
Yeah, Boston snagged him.

707
00:46:34,790 --> 00:46:36,655
I think they wanna wait and see.

708
00:46:43,666 --> 00:46:46,829
Are you okay, Billy? Billy?

709
00:46:47,470 --> 00:46:48,835
Can we talk?

710
00:46:49,038 --> 00:46:51,632
Yeah. Yeah.

711
00:47:02,084 --> 00:47:04,814
You're unhappy, Grady. Why?

712
00:47:08,724 --> 00:47:10,123
Wow.

713
00:47:10,793 --> 00:47:13,057
May I speak candidly? Sure, go ahead.

714
00:47:13,262 --> 00:47:17,096
Major League Baseball and its fans, they're gonna be more than happy

715
00:47:17,299 --> 00:47:19,699
to throw you and Google Boy under the bus

716
00:47:19,902 --> 00:47:21,870
if you keep doing what you're doing.

717
00:47:22,071 --> 00:47:24,437
You don't put a team together with a computer.

718
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,335
No? No.

719
00:47:26,542 --> 00:47:29,204
Baseball isn't just numbers. It's not science.

720
00:47:29,412 --> 00:47:32,575
If it was, anybody could do what we're doing, but they can't.

721
00:47:32,782 --> 00:47:34,477
They don't know what we know.

722
00:47:34,684 --> 00:47:37,744
They don't have our experience and our intuition.

723
00:47:38,287 --> 00:47:39,345
Okay.

724
00:47:39,989 --> 00:47:43,425
You got a kid in there that's got a degree in economics from Yale.

725
00:47:43,626 --> 00:47:46,720
You got a scout here with 29 years of baseball experience.

726
00:47:46,929 --> 00:47:49,489
You're listening to the wrong one.

727
00:47:49,699 --> 00:47:53,499
Now, there are intangibles that only baseball people understand.

728
00:47:53,703 --> 00:47:56,934
You're discounting what scouts have done for 150 years?

729
00:47:57,139 --> 00:47:59,130
Even yourself?

730
00:47:59,842 --> 00:48:01,969
Adapt or die.

731
00:48:04,814 --> 00:48:07,112
This is about you and your shit, isn't it?

732
00:48:07,316 --> 00:48:09,181
Twenty years ago, some scout got it wrong.

733
00:48:09,385 --> 00:48:13,014
Whoa. Okay. Okay. Now you declare war on the system.

734
00:48:13,222 --> 00:48:17,886
Okay, okay, my turn. You don't have a crystal ball.

735
00:48:18,094 --> 00:48:21,655
You can't look at a kid and predict his future any more than I can.

736
00:48:21,864 --> 00:48:24,094
I've sat at those kitchen tables with you

737
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:27,292
and listened to you tell parents, "When I know, I know.

738
00:48:27,503 --> 00:48:29,471
And when it comes to your son, I know."

739
00:48:29,672 --> 00:48:32,072
And you don't.

740
00:48:33,709 --> 00:48:35,472
You don't.

741
00:48:38,013 --> 00:48:40,413
Okay. I don't give a shit about friendship,

742
00:48:40,616 --> 00:48:43,141
this situation, or the past.

743
00:48:43,352 --> 00:48:46,913
Major League Baseball thinks the way I think. You're not gonna win.

744
00:48:47,123 --> 00:48:49,683
And I'll give you a nickel's worth of free advice.

745
00:48:49,892 --> 00:48:52,156
You're never gonna get another job

746
00:48:52,361 --> 00:48:55,888
after this catastrophic season you're about to set us all up for.

747
00:48:56,098 --> 00:48:58,066
You'll have to explain to your kid

748
00:48:58,267 --> 00:49:00,758
why you're working at Dick's Sporting Goods.

749
00:49:06,575 --> 00:49:09,009
I'm not gonna fire you, Grady.

750
00:49:12,882 --> 00:49:15,976
Fuck you, Billy. Now I will.

751
00:49:19,855 --> 00:49:21,755
Good luck, Art.

752
00:49:27,897 --> 00:49:30,923
Kubota. You never played ball, right?

753
00:49:31,133 --> 00:49:33,931
I played a little T-ball. You're the new head scout.

754
00:49:34,136 --> 00:49:35,797
Congratulations.

755
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:46,578
So Boston's gonna wait and see?

756
00:49:48,217 --> 00:49:49,548
Yeah.

757
00:49:50,886 --> 00:49:53,354
Yeah. It's just you and me, Pete.

758
00:49:53,556 --> 00:49:55,285
And we're all in.

759
00:49:59,161 --> 00:50:02,096
It sounds like you're apologizing for what they're doing.

760
00:50:02,298 --> 00:50:04,960
I'm not. I just don't know what you're gonna do

761
00:50:05,167 --> 00:50:08,500
with the budget that the A 's haVe. Who are you gonna get?

762
00:50:08,704 --> 00:50:10,831
I'm looking at the spring-training roster.

763
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,735
You gotta be kidding me. How so?

764
00:50:12,942 --> 00:50:14,409
He looked like a clown out there.

765
00:50:14,610 --> 00:50:16,703
Who? Chad Bradford.

766
00:50:16,912 --> 00:50:18,777
Tell me about Bradford.

767
00:50:18,981 --> 00:50:21,381
I like him a little bit, but he's a specialist.

768
00:50:21,584 --> 00:50:24,610
He's not a guy that you say, "The eighth inning is yours,

769
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:26,617
lefties Vs. Righties."

770
00:50:26,822 --> 00:50:28,449
In my opinion.

771
00:50:28,657 --> 00:50:32,559
I don't know what Billy Beane and management understands about him.

772
00:50:32,761 --> 00:50:36,356
He only throws the ball about 82, 83 miles an hour. There must be something...

773
00:50:36,565 --> 00:50:38,999
He is a freak, and not in a good way.

774
00:50:39,201 --> 00:50:40,532
Let me ask you this.

775
00:50:40,736 --> 00:50:43,170
Talking about trying to win a diVision.

776
00:50:43,372 --> 00:50:46,102
We're counting on DaVid to be the guy he was.

777
00:50:46,308 --> 00:50:48,776
I haVe my doubts. He's gotten old.

778
00:50:48,978 --> 00:50:52,414
That's why he's not in new York anymore, not in cleveland anymore.

779
00:50:52,615 --> 00:50:55,948
We paid him the money we should'Ve been giVing to Johnny Damon.

780
00:50:56,151 --> 00:50:57,778
Hey. Jeremy Giambi.

781
00:50:57,987 --> 00:51:00,148
That's the one to worry about.

782
00:51:00,356 --> 00:51:03,086
He gets comps up and down Vegas more than in Oakland.

783
00:51:03,292 --> 00:51:05,624
That should tell you something right there.

784
00:51:05,828 --> 00:51:07,819
Isn't that the deal with these guys?

785
00:51:08,030 --> 00:51:09,361
He has one good year.

786
00:51:09,765 --> 00:51:13,201
And he gets a huge offer and then he gets traded.

787
00:51:15,604 --> 00:51:18,698
Bob. Harder. Hatteberg.

788
00:51:21,844 --> 00:51:25,041
Good. Good.

789
00:51:25,981 --> 00:51:28,108
Billy, we haVe to talk about Hatteberg.

790
00:51:28,317 --> 00:51:30,751
Go. There's just no feel for the spot.

791
00:51:30,953 --> 00:51:34,445
I think it's a long shot that he can be a big-league first baseman.

792
00:51:34,657 --> 00:51:37,922
It's day one of the first week. You can't judge this yet.

793
00:51:38,127 --> 00:51:39,685
No, I think we can judge it.

794
00:51:39,895 --> 00:51:44,127
I mean, I like him, you know, but I can judge him.

795
00:51:44,333 --> 00:51:45,925
First base is the moon to him.

796
00:51:46,135 --> 00:51:49,969
It wasn't to Giambi. Giambi's the worst first baseman in baseball.

797
00:51:50,172 --> 00:51:53,630
Gonna compare him to Giambi? What are we talking about?

798
00:51:53,842 --> 00:51:55,104
All right.

799
00:51:57,146 --> 00:51:58,408
What do you think, Wash?

800
00:51:58,981 --> 00:52:02,417
The nice way to say it is he lacks confidence.

801
00:52:02,618 --> 00:52:04,085
Well, give him some.

802
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:07,380
I'll do that, but we got Pena, who can play first.

803
00:52:07,589 --> 00:52:09,955
And he's looking mighty good out there.

804
00:52:10,793 --> 00:52:12,852
We wanna go with Hattie.

805
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:19,424
We got six weeks.

806
00:52:19,635 --> 00:52:21,068
Get down in it.

807
00:52:27,676 --> 00:52:28,973
There you go. Scotty H.

808
00:52:29,178 --> 00:52:31,806
That's what I'm talking about. Picking machine.

809
00:52:32,014 --> 00:52:34,312
It's only baseball.

810
00:52:40,522 --> 00:52:42,547
This better work.

811
00:52:43,892 --> 00:52:45,792
I'm just kidding you.

812
00:52:56,238 --> 00:52:59,036
* Don't stop belieVin' *

813
00:52:59,241 --> 00:53:02,108
Let's go, Oakland!

814
00:53:02,311 --> 00:53:04,074
Let's go, Oakland!

815
00:53:04,279 --> 00:53:05,803
* Streetlight **

816
00:53:07,049 --> 00:53:10,382
What is wrong with this thing? It's a dollar, man.

817
00:53:10,586 --> 00:53:12,986
What? Welcome to Oakland, D.J.

818
00:53:13,188 --> 00:53:15,179
Oh, you gotta be shitting me.

819
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:19,191
I think this year, we're gonna show that it takes a team to win,

820
00:53:19,395 --> 00:53:21,522
not any individual guy, just a team.

821
00:53:21,730 --> 00:53:25,097
And I think we got a hell of a ball club here.

822
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:27,291
Chad, are you intimidated at all today?

823
00:53:27,503 --> 00:53:32,668
I wouldn't say I'm intimidated, really. I'm just really excited, like you said.

824
00:53:32,875 --> 00:53:36,333
Jeremy, how's the team gonna fare without your brother, Jason?

825
00:53:36,545 --> 00:53:39,207
Well, you know, the organization did a great job

826
00:53:39,415 --> 00:53:42,077
of bringing in good young guys to fill that role.

827
00:53:42,284 --> 00:53:44,684
Let's face it, they're getting a deal with you.

828
00:53:44,887 --> 00:53:47,117
The Yankees are paying Jason a lot of money.

829
00:53:47,322 --> 00:53:50,348
You are coming here on a dime. How does that make you feel?

830
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:52,459
I feel good. Um...

831
00:53:52,661 --> 00:53:55,596
How are the nerves in your fingers? You know.

832
00:53:55,798 --> 00:53:57,823
Gotta start with the age, 36 years old.

833
00:53:58,033 --> 00:54:00,228
How do you think your body's gonna hold up?

834
00:54:00,436 --> 00:54:03,599
You spend a lot of time at strip clubs, partying.

835
00:54:03,806 --> 00:54:06,366
Do you resent the attention you get off the field?

836
00:54:06,575 --> 00:54:07,564
I love it.

837
00:54:07,776 --> 00:54:09,937
You spend a lot of time in Vegas. I do.

838
00:54:10,145 --> 00:54:14,343
I feel great. I did a lot of work to get... Excuse me. Get out of my shot.

839
00:54:14,550 --> 00:54:15,539
Sorry, go ahead.

840
00:54:15,751 --> 00:54:17,844
There have been questions about my age

841
00:54:18,053 --> 00:54:21,750
and my declining skills, some say, but I'm here to prove that wrong.

842
00:54:21,957 --> 00:54:23,618
I asked if you were 100 percent.

843
00:54:32,634 --> 00:54:34,465
Excuse me, Mr. Beane? Hey, Chad.

844
00:54:34,670 --> 00:54:37,935
Hey, I'm not disturbing you, am I? Not at all. What's up?

845
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:41,200
I wanted to say thank you for this opportunity.

846
00:54:41,410 --> 00:54:44,846
Well, we enjoy having you. It's gonna work out well for all of us.

847
00:54:45,047 --> 00:54:48,915
I appreciate it, sir. Nobody's ever given me a chance like this before.

848
00:54:49,551 --> 00:54:50,575
Nobody?

849
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:53,745
Well, just you, sir.

850
00:54:54,356 --> 00:54:57,689
Well, it's a big day, one you won't forget.

851
00:54:57,893 --> 00:55:00,020
Appreciate it. And I wanna let you know

852
00:55:00,229 --> 00:55:03,027
I'm gonna be praying for you and your family.

853
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:05,328
No problem.

854
00:55:06,001 --> 00:55:09,562
Well, here we are just minutes away from the season opener of 2002

855
00:55:09,771 --> 00:55:10,931
for the Oakland A's.

856
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:12,801
The first pitch is moments away.

857
00:55:13,008 --> 00:55:15,101
We'll come back with the national anthem.

858
00:55:15,310 --> 00:55:16,675
Opening day is upon us.

859
00:55:17,246 --> 00:55:20,704
All right, fellas, smile. Here we go.

860
00:55:21,483 --> 00:55:25,180
 * Hey, she giVe me loVe And I feel all right now **

861
00:55:29,057 --> 00:55:31,025
I'm going in. Text me the play-by-play.

862
00:55:31,226 --> 00:55:32,784
What? Why?

863
00:55:33,762 --> 00:55:35,662
I don't watch the games.

864
00:55:44,239 --> 00:55:45,797
Detail, halt!

865
00:55:47,209 --> 00:55:50,042
And forward face!

866
00:56:50,672 --> 00:56:53,300
That's the third Ranger batter to be hit today.

867
00:56:53,508 --> 00:56:56,773
Twice Alex Rodriguez was nicked. The ninth...

868
00:57:32,147 --> 00:57:35,810
I should've made you a bigger part of the conversation from day one.

869
00:57:36,018 --> 00:57:37,986
It'd be clear what we're trying to do.

870
00:57:38,186 --> 00:57:41,121
That was my mistake, Art. I take responsibility for that.

871
00:57:41,323 --> 00:57:42,950
What are you trying to say?

872
00:57:43,158 --> 00:57:47,857
Doesn't matter what moves I make if you don't play the team the way they're designed to be.

873
00:57:49,698 --> 00:57:51,962
Billy, you're out of your depth.

874
00:57:53,168 --> 00:57:56,160
Why not Hatteberg at first? Because he can't play first.

875
00:57:56,371 --> 00:57:58,771
How do you know? Not my first baseball game.

876
00:57:58,974 --> 00:58:01,636
Scott Hatteberg can't hit. He gets on base.

877
00:58:01,843 --> 00:58:05,210
Still keeps us in the plus column. We need to be seven over.500.

878
00:58:05,414 --> 00:58:06,938
What?

879
00:58:10,385 --> 00:58:12,478
Anything else?

880
00:58:12,688 --> 00:58:16,920
Yeah. I would've rather seen Bradford in the end than Magnante.

881
00:58:17,559 --> 00:58:18,583
Bradford's a righty.

882
00:58:18,794 --> 00:58:21,854
I don't care about righty-lefty. I do.

883
00:58:26,535 --> 00:58:29,629
Could this be about your contract? No.

884
00:58:30,405 --> 00:58:34,171
This is about you doing your job and me doing mine.

885
00:58:34,376 --> 00:58:35,866
Mine's me being left alone

886
00:58:36,078 --> 00:58:38,979
to manage this team you assembled for me.

887
00:58:39,181 --> 00:58:42,207
I didn't assemble them for you, Art. No shit.

888
00:58:51,159 --> 00:58:52,592
Good meeting.

889
00:58:52,794 --> 00:58:53,852
Every time we talk,

890
00:58:54,062 --> 00:58:56,826
I'm reinvigorated by my love of the game.

891
00:59:20,222 --> 00:59:23,623
We got Grady Fuson, former head of scouting with the Athletics.

892
00:59:23,825 --> 00:59:26,555
And, Grady, can you interpret for us what's going on?

893
00:59:26,762 --> 00:59:28,889
They call it Moneyball. Moneyball?

894
00:59:29,097 --> 00:59:33,591
Yes, and it was a nice theory, and now it's just not working out.

895
00:59:33,802 --> 00:59:37,795
Billy Beane has built this team on the ideas of a guy, Bill James,

896
00:59:38,006 --> 00:59:42,602
who wrote an interesting book on baseball statistics.

897
00:59:42,811 --> 00:59:46,770
The problem is that Bill James never played, never managed.

898
00:59:46,982 --> 00:59:51,544
He was in fact a security guard at a pork-and-beans company.

899
00:59:51,753 --> 00:59:54,381
Do you see this as a decimation of the organization?

900
00:59:54,589 --> 00:59:56,216
He bought a ticket on the Titanic.

901
00:59:56,425 --> 00:59:57,414
Oh, boy.

902
00:59:57,626 --> 00:59:59,651
He's tried to come up with a new approach.

903
00:59:59,861 --> 01:00:02,887
My hat's off to him. It won't work.

904
01:00:03,698 --> 01:00:06,690
One-two pitch. Tejada strikes out.

905
01:00:06,902 --> 01:00:08,028
And that is the game.

906
01:00:08,236 --> 01:00:11,262
The Seattle Mariners win both games on this series, Ray.

907
01:00:11,473 --> 01:00:15,000
They'Ve won 10 in a row. Seattle is 13 and 3.

908
01:00:17,679 --> 01:00:19,977
I can't watch this shit.

909
01:00:21,149 --> 01:00:22,673
Go on the road with the team.

910
01:00:22,884 --> 01:00:25,045
You don't go on the road with the team.

911
01:00:25,253 --> 01:00:28,814
That's why I want you to do it. Why don't you?

912
01:00:30,358 --> 01:00:33,191
I can't develop personal relationships with these guys.

913
01:00:33,395 --> 01:00:35,886
I gotta be able to trade them, send them down,

914
01:00:36,097 --> 01:00:37,894
sometimes cut them.

915
01:00:40,101 --> 01:00:43,002
Which is something you should learn to do, by the way.

916
01:00:45,707 --> 01:00:48,767
I would never have to cut a player, unless you...

917
01:00:49,544 --> 01:00:52,536
Oh, come on. "Come on" what?

918
01:00:52,747 --> 01:00:55,215
Let's practice. No.

919
01:00:55,417 --> 01:00:58,250
Yeah. I'm a player. You gotta cut me from the roster.

920
01:00:58,453 --> 01:00:59,442
No. Go.

921
01:00:59,654 --> 01:01:01,087
What do you mean, no? No.

922
01:01:01,289 --> 01:01:02,881
Do it. This is stupid.

923
01:01:03,358 --> 01:01:05,451
Part of the job, man.

924
01:01:09,898 --> 01:01:11,388
Fine.

925
01:01:12,734 --> 01:01:16,170
Billy, please have a seat. I need to talk to you for a minute.

926
01:01:16,371 --> 01:01:17,861
Go on.

927
01:01:19,241 --> 01:01:21,300
You've been a huge part of this team.

928
01:01:21,510 --> 01:01:24,274
But sometimes you have to make decisions for the team.

929
01:01:24,479 --> 01:01:26,037
I'm sure you can understand.

930
01:01:26,248 --> 01:01:29,240
You're cutting me? I'm really sorry.

931
01:01:30,085 --> 01:01:31,575
I just bought a house here.

932
01:01:31,786 --> 01:01:33,413
Well... In Oakland.

933
01:01:37,192 --> 01:01:38,750
Well, uh... Well...

934
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:42,157
"Well... Well..."? That's all you got to say?

935
01:01:42,364 --> 01:01:44,696
My kid just started a new school.

936
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:48,199
They made friends. That's, uh...

937
01:01:48,803 --> 01:01:51,567
You shouldn't pull them out in the middle of the year.

938
01:01:51,773 --> 01:01:54,606
You should wait. What the hell are you talking about?

939
01:01:54,809 --> 01:01:56,606
I don't know. I shouldn't have...

940
01:01:56,811 --> 01:01:59,245
I'm not gonna do this. I think this is stupid.

941
01:01:59,447 --> 01:02:02,610
I'm not gonna fire anybody, and this is dumb.

942
01:02:03,718 --> 01:02:06,915
They're professional ballplayers. Just be straight with them.

943
01:02:07,122 --> 01:02:09,056
No fluff, just facts.

944
01:02:09,257 --> 01:02:14,058
Pete, I gotta let you go. Jack's office will handle the details.

945
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:19,197
That's it? Pfft.

946
01:02:19,434 --> 01:02:20,423
Really?

947
01:02:20,635 --> 01:02:25,038
You rather get a bullet to the head or five to the chest and bleed to death?

948
01:02:26,675 --> 01:02:29,269
Are those my only two options?

949
01:02:29,477 --> 01:02:31,638
Go on the road with the team.

950
01:02:34,282 --> 01:02:35,874
Okay.

951
01:02:45,260 --> 01:02:46,750
Say, bro.

952
01:02:46,962 --> 01:02:48,953
Let me ask you a question. Yeah.

953
01:02:49,164 --> 01:02:51,997
How come your boss doesn't travel with the team?

954
01:02:53,902 --> 01:02:57,429
He doesn't like to mingle with the players.

955
01:02:59,274 --> 01:03:01,834
Is that supposed to make us easier to cut?

956
01:03:07,082 --> 01:03:09,175
I don't know. I don't know.

957
01:03:09,384 --> 01:03:14,151
And how come soda is a dollar in the clubhouse?

958
01:03:14,356 --> 01:03:16,586
I never seen nothing like that.

959
01:03:17,859 --> 01:03:20,657
Billy likes to keep the money on the field.

960
01:03:20,862 --> 01:03:22,727
Soda money?

961
01:03:23,231 --> 01:03:24,721
Really?

962
01:03:25,266 --> 01:03:28,633
Where on the field is the dollar I'm paying for soda?

963
01:03:30,271 --> 01:03:33,672
It's hard to see exactly,

964
01:03:33,875 --> 01:03:36,810
but it's there, yeah. Yeah, it is hard to see.

965
01:03:37,479 --> 01:03:39,003
I'm done.

966
01:03:50,191 --> 01:03:52,921
Hey, Dad. Hi, honey.

967
01:03:53,128 --> 01:03:55,096
How are you? I'm good.

968
01:03:55,296 --> 01:03:57,355
Was it bumpy? It was okay.

969
01:03:59,868 --> 01:04:02,496
So with this loss tonight, the Oakland Athletics

970
01:04:02,704 --> 01:04:07,767
incredibly, haVe lost 14 of their last 17 games.

971
01:04:07,976 --> 01:04:11,002
They are 10 games back in the American League West.

972
01:04:11,212 --> 01:04:13,680
Is it fair to say the experiment has failed?

973
01:04:13,882 --> 01:04:16,180
Well, absolutely. It was predictable.

974
01:04:16,384 --> 01:04:20,821
You don't wish anybody a lack of success, but the facts are in front of you.

975
01:04:21,022 --> 01:04:22,819
You can't blame Art Howe.

976
01:04:23,024 --> 01:04:24,013
No.

977
01:04:24,225 --> 01:04:28,321
The fact of the matter is, this is not about statistics, this is about people.

978
01:04:28,530 --> 01:04:31,260
Art Howe is not the problem.

979
01:04:31,466 --> 01:04:35,334
The problem is in the general manager's office with Billy Beane.

980
01:04:35,537 --> 01:04:38,165
The root of the problem for me is philosophical.

981
01:04:38,373 --> 01:04:40,500
I said it before. This is fantasy baseball.

982
01:04:41,042 --> 01:04:42,475
Billy is just not thinking.

983
01:04:42,677 --> 01:04:45,237
Start thinking about a new GM, making changes.

984
01:04:45,447 --> 01:04:47,005
He never goes to the games.

985
01:04:47,215 --> 01:04:48,648
This was Very predictable.

986
01:04:48,850 --> 01:04:51,410
He needs to look at what's going on.

987
01:04:51,619 --> 01:04:55,055
The man needs to get real. I want Billy Beane gone.

988
01:04:55,256 --> 01:04:57,690
Calling for Beane's head. I want your thoughts.

989
01:04:57,892 --> 01:05:03,057
The past 18 games, they'Ve been shut out or scored one run four times.

990
01:05:03,264 --> 01:05:04,925
They're just not scoring enough.

991
01:05:05,133 --> 01:05:08,261
It's not just the offense, not Thad Bosley and the hitters.

992
01:05:08,470 --> 01:05:12,736
It's everything. If there was one thing you could pick out, you'd try to fix it,

993
01:05:12,941 --> 01:05:18,243
but just everything is in a funk right now.

994
01:05:22,884 --> 01:05:25,409
What the hell am I doing?

995
01:05:27,822 --> 01:05:30,552
Oh, man.

996
01:05:30,759 --> 01:05:32,727
Look, Steve.

997
01:05:36,297 --> 01:05:38,390
I believe in what we're doing.

998
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:41,433
The record doesn't reflect the strength of this team

999
01:05:41,636 --> 01:05:44,298
or where we're gonna be at the end of the season.

1000
01:05:44,506 --> 01:05:49,102
Now, Pete and I here feel very strongly that we stay on the track we've chosen.

1001
01:05:49,310 --> 01:05:51,801
Our sample size has been too small. It's too...

1002
01:05:52,013 --> 01:05:53,640
Early. It's still early.

1003
01:05:54,349 --> 01:05:57,409
Where do we expect to be by the All-Star break?

1004
01:05:58,620 --> 01:06:01,088
Our goal and our expectation

1005
01:06:01,289 --> 01:06:05,020
is by mid-July to be within seven games of first.

1006
01:06:05,226 --> 01:06:06,625
That would be this working.

1007
01:06:06,828 --> 01:06:09,296
That keeps us in the hunt. Exceptionally well.

1008
01:06:09,898 --> 01:06:12,731
By July. July.

1009
01:06:12,934 --> 01:06:16,768
And what's gonna prevent you from accomplishing that?

1010
01:06:16,971 --> 01:06:18,598
What are you afraid of?

1011
01:06:18,807 --> 01:06:21,674
Nothing. That's why we're here, Steve.

1012
01:06:21,876 --> 01:06:25,175
That's why we get up in the morning. That's all we do.

1013
01:06:44,799 --> 01:06:46,289
More? Yeah, a little more.

1014
01:06:46,501 --> 01:06:49,937
Don't tell your mother. I won't.

1015
01:06:50,705 --> 01:06:52,798
Chocolate sauce? Yes.

1016
01:06:53,675 --> 01:06:55,040
Stop.

1017
01:06:57,679 --> 01:07:00,614
Big spoon or little spoon? Little spoon.

1018
01:07:02,016 --> 01:07:03,643
Thank you.

1019
01:07:13,361 --> 01:07:16,159
Dad, there's no way you're gonna lose your job, right?

1020
01:07:16,364 --> 01:07:17,353
What?

1021
01:07:18,933 --> 01:07:20,025
Well, I don't know.

1022
01:07:20,235 --> 01:07:22,294
I'm just wondering. Where'd you hear that?

1023
01:07:22,503 --> 01:07:24,437
Well, I go on the Internet sometimes.

1024
01:07:24,639 --> 01:07:27,733
Well, don't do that. Don't go on the Internet.

1025
01:07:27,942 --> 01:07:30,775
Or watch TV or read newspapers

1026
01:07:31,579 --> 01:07:33,479
or talk to people.

1027
01:07:33,681 --> 01:07:36,309
I don't talk to people. I just read stuff.

1028
01:07:36,517 --> 01:07:39,111
Honey, everything's fine. Everything's fine.

1029
01:07:39,888 --> 01:07:41,719
Really, you don't have to worry.

1030
01:07:41,923 --> 01:07:45,256
But if you lose your job, will you have to move away?

1031
01:07:46,060 --> 01:07:48,460
Honey, I'm not gonna lose my job.

1032
01:07:49,898 --> 01:07:51,866
You don't have to worry.

1033
01:07:54,269 --> 01:07:56,601
Okay. Hey.

1034
01:07:57,238 --> 01:08:00,571
There's no problem. Okay.

1035
01:08:00,775 --> 01:08:04,074
All right? I got uptown problems, which are not problems at all.

1036
01:08:05,113 --> 01:08:06,444
You're not worried, right?

1037
01:08:06,648 --> 01:08:09,139
No, I'm not worried. Okay.

1038
01:08:16,457 --> 01:08:18,084
Pena.

1039
01:08:20,795 --> 01:08:22,387
Okay.

1040
01:08:35,243 --> 01:08:37,336
I want Dye in right,

1041
01:08:37,545 --> 01:08:40,343
Justice DH'ing, Pena on the bench,

1042
01:08:40,548 --> 01:08:42,277
Hatteberg at first,

1043
01:08:42,483 --> 01:08:45,509
and anyone but Mags first out of the pen.

1044
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:47,585
You want Pena on the bench?

1045
01:08:47,789 --> 01:08:50,883
That's right. So you can play Hattie.

1046
01:08:51,092 --> 01:08:53,287
Pena is not only the best first baseman,

1047
01:08:53,494 --> 01:08:55,621
he's the only first baseman.

1048
01:08:55,830 --> 01:08:58,196
Hattie gets on base more than Pena.

1049
01:08:58,399 --> 01:09:00,833
In fact, 20 percent more. And his fielding?

1050
01:09:01,035 --> 01:09:03,697
His fielding does not matter.

1051
01:09:04,739 --> 01:09:06,934
I've heard enough of this. Have you?

1052
01:09:07,141 --> 01:09:08,699
And I, uh...

1053
01:09:09,577 --> 01:09:12,512
I disagree with you, plain and simple.

1054
01:09:13,481 --> 01:09:15,608
And moreover, I'm playing my team

1055
01:09:16,150 --> 01:09:19,779
in a way that I can explain in job interviews next winter.

1056
01:09:20,755 --> 01:09:22,382
Okay? Ahem.

1057
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:30,469
Hattie. Not Pena.

1058
01:09:34,874 --> 01:09:36,205
What's up, skip?

1059
01:09:36,409 --> 01:09:38,809
How you doing? Good, how you doing, man?

1060
01:09:39,011 --> 01:09:40,603
Get some sleep last night?

1061
01:09:42,782 --> 01:09:45,842
As the A 's hit the field, we are ready for baseball.

1062
01:09:46,052 --> 01:09:49,351
First one out of the dugout is rookie sensation carlos Pena,

1063
01:09:49,555 --> 01:09:53,787
one of the few bright lights in this lineup, taking his spot at first base.

1064
01:10:26,659 --> 01:10:30,322
* Down, gettin' down There's a whole lot of rhythm *

1065
01:10:34,233 --> 01:10:37,794
Billy, quick question. Do you expect these guys to produce more or...?

1066
01:10:38,004 --> 01:10:40,165
Not now. What's the reason for the slump?

1067
01:10:40,373 --> 01:10:41,806
* We gotta haVe the funk *

1068
01:10:42,008 --> 01:10:44,636
* Ow, we want the funk *

1069
01:10:44,844 --> 01:10:46,175
* GiVe up the funk *

1070
01:10:46,379 --> 01:10:48,540
* Ow, we need the funk *

1071
01:10:49,415 --> 01:10:51,212
* We gotta haVe the funk **

1072
01:10:58,591 --> 01:11:00,115
Get down.

1073
01:11:04,330 --> 01:11:06,264
Is losing fun?

1074
01:11:09,502 --> 01:11:12,562
Is losing fun? No.

1075
01:11:16,742 --> 01:11:18,903
What are you having fun for?

1076
01:11:44,370 --> 01:11:46,736
That's what losing sounds like.

1077
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:02,719
Are you okay, Dad?

1078
01:12:03,522 --> 01:12:05,422
You're doing it again. What?

1079
01:12:05,625 --> 01:12:07,889
You're worrying about me.

1080
01:12:08,127 --> 01:12:09,924
You're in last place, Dad.

1081
01:12:10,129 --> 01:12:12,495
Do I look worried? Yeah.

1082
01:12:12,698 --> 01:12:16,600
Because you're getting on an airplane, and those things crash all the time.

1083
01:12:16,802 --> 01:12:19,202
Please stop worrying about your dad.

1084
01:12:21,507 --> 01:12:23,099
We're all set. Okay.

1085
01:12:25,011 --> 01:12:27,172
I love you. Love you too.

1086
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:30,514
All right. Your dad's not in trouble.

1087
01:12:31,584 --> 01:12:33,518
Okay.

1088
01:13:12,458 --> 01:13:14,221
Yeah.

1089
01:13:20,266 --> 01:13:22,359
Suzanne, get me Ed Wade. Okay.

1090
01:13:22,568 --> 01:13:24,263
Coffee on? Yes.

1091
01:13:24,470 --> 01:13:27,064
Good morning. Good morning, Billy.

1092
01:13:30,676 --> 01:13:32,473
Oh, hi, Louisa.

1093
01:13:32,678 --> 01:13:35,545
I need Ed Wade for Billy Beane. Hi.

1094
01:13:36,782 --> 01:13:37,771
Please hold.

1095
01:13:37,983 --> 01:13:40,543
What's up? Wade's on 2.

1096
01:13:40,753 --> 01:13:42,186
Ed? Hello?

1097
01:13:42,388 --> 01:13:44,788
Ed, it's Billy. Billy, what's up?

1098
01:13:44,990 --> 01:13:47,959
Look, I need a little help on defense. Okay.

1099
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:50,685
I'm willing to trade Jeremy Giambi for it.

1100
01:13:51,464 --> 01:13:52,863
Really? What?

1101
01:13:53,065 --> 01:13:55,158
Mm-hm. Who you got? What?

1102
01:13:55,368 --> 01:13:58,496
Well, let me think. What are you doing?

1103
01:13:58,704 --> 01:13:59,898
Cleaning house.

1104
01:14:00,106 --> 01:14:02,040
Mabry? Maybe what?

1105
01:14:02,241 --> 01:14:05,233
No, Mabry. Hold on.

1106
01:14:05,444 --> 01:14:07,275
No. Why not?

1107
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:09,573
Because you can't trade Jeremy Giambi.

1108
01:14:10,883 --> 01:14:12,350
He'll be fine, Ed.

1109
01:14:12,551 --> 01:14:15,111
Why do I get the feeling you're picking my pocket?

1110
01:14:15,321 --> 01:14:18,620
I'm not. You're picking mine. Giambi's name alone is worth more.

1111
01:14:18,824 --> 01:14:20,985
What's wrong with him? Nothing.

1112
01:14:21,193 --> 01:14:24,651
Can we say it's done in theory and start drawing up the paperwork?

1113
01:14:24,864 --> 01:14:27,059
Okay, but you're gonna haVe... Great.

1114
01:14:27,266 --> 01:14:28,927
He was gonna say something else.

1115
01:14:29,135 --> 01:14:31,695
When you get the answer you're looking for, hang up.

1116
01:14:31,904 --> 01:14:32,893
Suzanne. Yes?

1117
01:14:33,105 --> 01:14:35,539
David Dombrowski. Okay.

1118
01:14:35,741 --> 01:14:38,676
And Pena's going too. I don't think you should do that.

1119
01:14:38,878 --> 01:14:40,812
I really don't think you should do that.

1120
01:14:41,013 --> 01:14:43,311
I want Hatteberg in the lineup tonight.

1121
01:14:43,516 --> 01:14:44,847
You need to take a minute.

1122
01:14:45,050 --> 01:14:48,110
I think you seriously need to think about what you're doing.

1123
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:50,788
Because you're upset. Okay.

1124
01:14:51,323 --> 01:14:53,120
What am I missing?

1125
01:14:53,859 --> 01:14:56,157
These are hard moves to explain to people.

1126
01:14:57,062 --> 01:14:58,654
Why is that a problem, Pete?

1127
01:15:01,467 --> 01:15:03,662
Don't make an emotional decision, Billy.

1128
01:15:03,869 --> 01:15:05,632
David Dombrowski's on 3.

1129
01:15:05,838 --> 01:15:08,204
Look, we're gonna shake things up.

1130
01:15:08,407 --> 01:15:11,399
Dave. Pena's going on the block. You're my first call.

1131
01:15:12,445 --> 01:15:15,209
Because he's making the rest of the team look bad.

1132
01:15:16,182 --> 01:15:18,013
He's gonna be a Rookie of the Year.

1133
01:15:18,217 --> 01:15:21,311
Probably an All-Star. He's an All-Star, Dave.

1134
01:15:22,254 --> 01:15:24,984
No. I want a reliever and cash.

1135
01:15:25,558 --> 01:15:29,187
Okay. You got five minutes, Dave. I'm not waiting.

1136
01:15:29,929 --> 01:15:33,695
Billy, Pena is an All-Star, okay?

1137
01:15:33,899 --> 01:15:39,769
And if you dump him and this Hatteberg thing doesn't work out, you know this is...

1138
01:15:39,972 --> 01:15:43,032
This is the kind of decision that gets you fired.

1139
01:15:43,242 --> 01:15:44,766
It is.

1140
01:15:45,344 --> 01:15:47,369
Yes, you're right.

1141
01:15:47,847 --> 01:15:50,111
I may lose my job.

1142
01:15:50,316 --> 01:15:53,683
In which case I'm a 44-year-old guy with a high school diploma

1143
01:15:53,886 --> 01:15:57,151
and a daughter I'd like to be able to send to college.

1144
01:15:57,690 --> 01:16:00,716
You're 25 years old, with a degree from Yale

1145
01:16:00,926 --> 01:16:03,451
and a pretty impressive apprenticeship.

1146
01:16:04,330 --> 01:16:07,060
I don't think we're asking the right question.

1147
01:16:07,566 --> 01:16:10,535
I think the question we should be asking is,

1148
01:16:10,736 --> 01:16:13,364
do you believe in this thing or not?

1149
01:16:15,274 --> 01:16:16,798
I do.

1150
01:16:19,879 --> 01:16:22,905
It's a problem you think we need to explain ourselves.

1151
01:16:23,115 --> 01:16:26,278
Don't. To anyone.

1152
01:16:29,688 --> 01:16:31,121
Okay.

1153
01:16:33,692 --> 01:16:37,128
Now, I'm gonna see this thing through, for better or worse.

1154
01:16:40,599 --> 01:16:45,400
Just tell me, do you project we'll win more with Hatteberg or Pena at first?

1155
01:16:46,038 --> 01:16:48,438
It's close...

1156
01:16:49,275 --> 01:16:51,675
but theoretically, Hatteberg.

1157
01:16:52,578 --> 01:16:54,341
What are we talking about, then?

1158
01:16:54,547 --> 01:16:57,539
Dombrowski's on again, on 3.

1159
01:16:59,919 --> 01:17:01,318
Yeah?

1160
01:17:02,054 --> 01:17:03,919
Okay, that'll work.

1161
01:17:04,623 --> 01:17:06,853
Great. I need one more thing.

1162
01:17:07,059 --> 01:17:10,256
Soda. Yeah, I don't want my guys paying for soda.

1163
01:17:10,462 --> 01:17:13,124
I want you to stock my machine for three years.

1164
01:17:13,332 --> 01:17:14,765
I'm serious.

1165
01:17:15,834 --> 01:17:17,802
Great. It's a deal.

1166
01:17:18,938 --> 01:17:20,872
Go tell Pena he's gotta pack.

1167
01:17:22,408 --> 01:17:25,571
You want me to tell Pena? Part of the job.

1168
01:17:28,113 --> 01:17:30,513
What about Giambi? You want me to tell him too?

1169
01:17:30,716 --> 01:17:32,650
I'll tell him.

1170
01:17:39,625 --> 01:17:41,183
Excuse me, Carlos? Yeah?

1171
01:17:41,393 --> 01:17:43,327
Can I speak with you a minute? Yeah.

1172
01:17:52,104 --> 01:17:54,664
Carlos, you've been traded to the Tigers.

1173
01:17:58,177 --> 01:18:00,145
This is Jay Palmer's number.

1174
01:18:00,346 --> 01:18:02,871
He's the traveling secretary for the team.

1175
01:18:03,082 --> 01:18:06,074
He's expecting your call. He'll take care of everything.

1176
01:18:15,394 --> 01:18:17,828
Is that it? Yes.

1177
01:18:25,170 --> 01:18:26,569
Okay.

1178
01:18:38,951 --> 01:18:40,384
Okay.

1179
01:18:42,988 --> 01:18:44,148
Art, you got a minute?

1180
01:18:47,459 --> 01:18:50,451
Yeah. Take a seat.

1181
01:18:53,932 --> 01:18:58,198
You can't start Pena at first tonight. You'll have to start Hatteberg.

1182
01:18:59,104 --> 01:19:01,231
I don't wanna go 15 rounds, Billy.

1183
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:04,034
The lineup card is mine, and that's all.

1184
01:19:04,243 --> 01:19:06,234
That lineup card is definitely yours.

1185
01:19:06,445 --> 01:19:08,970
I'm just saying you can't start Pena at first.

1186
01:19:09,348 --> 01:19:10,645
Well...

1187
01:19:12,117 --> 01:19:14,210
I am starting him at first.

1188
01:19:14,420 --> 01:19:18,356
I don't think so. He plays for Detroit now.

1189
01:19:22,327 --> 01:19:24,454
You traded Pena?

1190
01:19:25,664 --> 01:19:27,154
Yeah.

1191
01:19:27,366 --> 01:19:31,769
And Menechino, Hiljus, Tam are all being sent down.

1192
01:19:31,970 --> 01:19:36,202
You are outside your mind. Yeah. Cuckoo.

1193
01:19:38,043 --> 01:19:40,807
You wanted to see me? Yeah, Jeremy, grab a seat.

1194
01:19:44,416 --> 01:19:46,884
Jeremy, you've been traded to the Phillies.

1195
01:19:47,086 --> 01:19:49,680
This is Ed Wade's number. He's a good guy, the GM.

1196
01:19:49,888 --> 01:19:52,186
He's expecting your call.

1197
01:19:52,391 --> 01:19:55,189
Buddy will help you with the plane flight.

1198
01:19:56,562 --> 01:19:59,224
You're a good ballplayer, Jeremy,

1199
01:19:59,431 --> 01:20:01,922
and we wish you the best.

1200
01:20:18,484 --> 01:20:20,543
Jeremy's gone too.

1201
01:20:22,554 --> 01:20:24,613
You're killing this team.

1202
01:20:24,823 --> 01:20:28,486
Art, I can do this all day long.

1203
01:20:34,633 --> 01:20:35,964
Hey.

1204
01:20:36,969 --> 01:20:38,994
You agree with this?

1205
01:20:40,405 --> 01:20:42,066
Hundred percent.

1206
01:20:43,642 --> 01:20:45,166
You want this door closed?

1207
01:20:57,756 --> 01:21:00,190
Scotty H. Sir?

1208
01:21:01,226 --> 01:21:04,855
Go field some grounders. Yes, sir.

1209
01:21:05,063 --> 01:21:06,826
Everybody, listen up.

1210
01:21:09,868 --> 01:21:12,598
You may not look like a winning team...

1211
01:21:15,874 --> 01:21:17,933
but you are one.

1212
01:21:22,347 --> 01:21:23,644
So...

1213
01:21:25,284 --> 01:21:27,275
play like one tonight.

1214
01:21:35,961 --> 01:21:38,122
Oh, shit.

1215
01:21:41,233 --> 01:21:44,396
When you're getting your pitch, you're hitting.625, massive.

1216
01:21:44,603 --> 01:21:46,400
You're crushing the ball.

1217
01:21:46,605 --> 01:21:49,438
But when you swing at things... Your pitch is middle-in.

1218
01:21:49,641 --> 01:21:52,474
When you're swinging low and away, you're batting.158.

1219
01:21:52,678 --> 01:21:54,703
Every at bat's like a hand of blackjack.

1220
01:21:54,913 --> 01:21:57,211
Every card that's dealt, your odds change.

1221
01:21:57,416 --> 01:22:01,716
So every first-pitch strike, your batting average goes down about 75 points.

1222
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:03,046
Seventy-five points.

1223
01:22:03,255 --> 01:22:05,485
He should throw 100 pitches before the fifth.

1224
01:22:05,691 --> 01:22:07,420
You wanna knock that starter out.

1225
01:22:07,626 --> 01:22:11,084
I want you taking at bats off the 10th and 11 th pitcher by the end.

1226
01:22:11,296 --> 01:22:13,662
This is your basic breakdown of the pitches,

1227
01:22:13,866 --> 01:22:16,027
where you should be hitting them, why.

1228
01:22:16,235 --> 01:22:19,762
So you want us to walk more? Good question. Yes.

1229
01:22:21,206 --> 01:22:23,231
Mr. Justice.

1230
01:22:23,442 --> 01:22:25,376
Had a few thoughts. Yeah?

1231
01:22:25,577 --> 01:22:27,909
Yeah. Gonna teach me some things?

1232
01:22:28,413 --> 01:22:30,074
Excuse me?

1233
01:22:31,683 --> 01:22:33,913
Never seen a GM talk to players like that.

1234
01:22:34,119 --> 01:22:36,781
You never seen a GM who was a player.

1235
01:22:38,557 --> 01:22:39,888
Huh.

1236
01:22:43,095 --> 01:22:45,859
We got a problem, David? No, it's okay.

1237
01:22:46,064 --> 01:22:48,225
I know your routine.

1238
01:22:48,433 --> 01:22:50,697
It's patter. It's for effect.

1239
01:22:53,005 --> 01:22:57,101
But it's for them, all right? That shit ain't for me.

1240
01:22:57,676 --> 01:22:59,371
Oh, you're special?

1241
01:23:01,847 --> 01:23:06,409
You're paying me 7 million bucks a year, man, so, yeah,

1242
01:23:06,618 --> 01:23:08,916
maybe I am, a little bit.

1243
01:23:09,121 --> 01:23:12,056
No, man, I ain't paying you 7.

1244
01:23:12,791 --> 01:23:14,656
Yankees are paying half your salary.

1245
01:23:14,860 --> 01:23:17,624
That's what the New York Yankees think of you.

1246
01:23:18,530 --> 01:23:22,796
They're paying you $3.5 million to play against them.

1247
01:23:24,136 --> 01:23:26,263
Where you going with this, Billy?

1248
01:23:27,105 --> 01:23:29,403
David, you're 37.

1249
01:23:29,608 --> 01:23:33,339
How about you and I be honest about what each of us want out of this?

1250
01:23:34,980 --> 01:23:38,313
I wanna milk the last ounce of baseball you got in you.

1251
01:23:38,517 --> 01:23:40,781
And you wanna stay in the show.

1252
01:23:41,386 --> 01:23:43,286
Let's do that.

1253
01:23:44,222 --> 01:23:46,747
I'm not paying you for the player you used to be.

1254
01:23:46,959 --> 01:23:49,928
I'm paying you for the player you are right now.

1255
01:23:50,128 --> 01:23:53,529
You're smart. You get what we're trying to do here.

1256
01:23:53,732 --> 01:23:56,496
Make an example for the younger guys.

1257
01:23:56,702 --> 01:23:58,465
Be a leader.

1258
01:23:59,171 --> 01:24:00,798
Can you do that?

1259
01:24:07,946 --> 01:24:10,847
All right. I got you.

1260
01:24:13,352 --> 01:24:15,047
We're cool?

1261
01:24:17,155 --> 01:24:18,588
We're cool.

1262
01:24:23,895 --> 01:24:25,089
Scotty H.

1263
01:24:25,297 --> 01:24:27,390
Yo, what's up, D. J? Picking machine.

1264
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,961
How you liking first base, man?

1265
01:24:32,304 --> 01:24:35,467
It's coming along. Picking it up.

1266
01:24:35,674 --> 01:24:39,770
You know, tough transition, but I'm starting to feel better with it.

1267
01:24:39,978 --> 01:24:41,969
Yeah? Yeah.

1268
01:24:42,180 --> 01:24:44,045
What's your biggest fear?

1269
01:24:44,716 --> 01:24:47,378
A baseball being hit in my general direction.

1270
01:24:49,521 --> 01:24:52,615
That's funny. Seriously, what is it?

1271
01:24:56,094 --> 01:24:58,392
No, seriously, that is.

1272
01:25:09,207 --> 01:25:11,505
Well, hey, good luck with that.

1273
01:25:11,710 --> 01:25:13,837
Be social out there.

1274
01:25:14,780 --> 01:25:17,305
Social. Social. Like a greeter at the Gap.

1275
01:25:17,516 --> 01:25:19,541
Guy steps into your office, chat him up.

1276
01:25:19,751 --> 01:25:22,379
You're well-read. You went to school.

1277
01:25:22,587 --> 01:25:24,714
Yeah. Have some fun. Relax.

1278
01:25:24,923 --> 01:25:27,790
Everyone wants to attack. Quit trying to attack.

1279
01:25:27,993 --> 01:25:31,190
Let the game come to you, man. There's no clock on this thing.

1280
01:25:31,396 --> 01:25:32,795
This is a war of attrition.

1281
01:25:32,998 --> 01:25:37,367
If I take more, I could even take a few strikes, but I'll get walked more.

1282
01:25:37,569 --> 01:25:41,300
You get on base, we win. You don't, we lose.

1283
01:25:41,506 --> 01:25:44,805
And I hate losing, Chavvie. I hate it.

1284
01:25:45,010 --> 01:25:47,535
I hate losing more than I even wanna win.

1285
01:25:47,746 --> 01:25:49,043
And there's a difference.

1286
01:25:49,247 --> 01:25:50,714
No bunts. Bunts is an out.

1287
01:25:50,916 --> 01:25:54,147
Even if the third baseman is back? No bunting whatsoever.

1288
01:25:54,352 --> 01:25:57,048
If someone bunts on us, throw it to first.

1289
01:25:57,255 --> 01:25:58,950
Don't be a hero and go to second.

1290
01:25:59,157 --> 01:26:00,556
Let them make the mistakes.

1291
01:26:00,759 --> 01:26:03,660
When your enemy's making mistakes, don't interrupt them.

1292
01:26:03,862 --> 01:26:06,353
They're giving you an out. Just giving it to you.

1293
01:26:06,565 --> 01:26:07,793
Take it. Say thank you.

1294
01:26:07,999 --> 01:26:09,967
Another thing. No more stealing.

1295
01:26:10,168 --> 01:26:12,193
That's what I do, what you pay me to do.

1296
01:26:12,404 --> 01:26:15,305
I pay you to get on first, not get thrown out at second.

1297
01:26:15,507 --> 01:26:20,444
This is a process. It's a process, it's a process. Okay?

1298
01:26:32,824 --> 01:26:36,658
 Jason takes it, goes to second for the only out, and the A 's get a run.

1299
01:26:38,330 --> 01:26:42,391
Jermaine Dye homers again, his second in two games.

1300
01:26:42,601 --> 01:26:47,038
And the A 's are still hanging in. We'll get you scores here.

1301
01:26:47,239 --> 01:26:51,642
The A 's pull within two of the Angels for the wild-card chase.

1302
01:26:51,843 --> 01:26:53,970
The Reds haVe now dropped fiVe in a row

1303
01:26:54,179 --> 01:26:57,546
as Oakland beats them in the beginning of this series 5 to 3.

1304
01:26:57,749 --> 01:26:59,046
Tejada walks.

1305
01:26:59,251 --> 01:27:00,548
Ball four.

1306
01:27:00,752 --> 01:27:03,585
Ball four and Hatteberg walks.

1307
01:27:05,157 --> 01:27:08,615
What is happening in Oakland? The A 's haVe won seven in a row.

1308
01:27:08,827 --> 01:27:11,022
A lot of excitement. What a winning streak.

1309
01:27:11,229 --> 01:27:14,027
But how about the calming influence of Art Howe?

1310
01:27:14,232 --> 01:27:17,827
When you say "your source," if it's not me or Peter, they don't know.

1311
01:27:18,036 --> 01:27:19,697
He's managing an unorthodox team.

1312
01:27:19,905 --> 01:27:21,668
Right. It's not a perfect roster.

1313
01:27:21,873 --> 01:27:25,138
But right now, Art Howe is the reason this team is winning.

1314
01:27:25,343 --> 01:27:27,903
He deserves the credit. Great, thanks. Bye.

1315
01:27:28,113 --> 01:27:29,603
Did you hear that?

1316
01:27:29,814 --> 01:27:32,749
I heard "seven in a row." You get the Cleveland matchups?

1317
01:27:32,951 --> 01:27:34,816
Yeah, right here.

1318
01:27:42,594 --> 01:27:44,027
Voos. Billy.

1319
01:27:44,229 --> 01:27:47,460
That smell is getting worse. I'm on it.

1320
01:27:48,233 --> 01:27:50,360
What are we doing? Splitting it in half?

1321
01:27:50,569 --> 01:27:52,366
Both sides of the plate. Got it.

1322
01:27:53,104 --> 01:27:55,265
Huddy. Mix it up. Yes, sir.

1323
01:27:55,473 --> 01:27:57,566
Trust your slider, yeah? Yes, sir.

1324
01:27:57,776 --> 01:27:59,744
You guys quit distracting him.

1325
01:27:59,945 --> 01:28:02,641
You couldn't hit that shit last night with a paddle.

1326
01:28:02,847 --> 01:28:04,644
You gotta see more pitches.

1327
01:28:04,849 --> 01:28:07,317
All right, Billy. Patience.

1328
01:28:11,156 --> 01:28:12,714
Hey, David. Hey, Billy.

1329
01:28:12,924 --> 01:28:14,255
Great at bats. Thank you.

1330
01:28:14,459 --> 01:28:15,983
Really quality. Thank you.

1331
01:28:16,194 --> 01:28:18,856
Base hit to right field. Tejada scores.

1332
01:28:19,064 --> 01:28:21,897
ChaVez coming in. The ball gets past Guiel.

1333
01:28:22,867 --> 01:28:26,928
The A 's, from 5-nothing down, now lead 6 to 5.

1334
01:28:36,982 --> 01:28:39,951
The Oakland A 's are completely out of hand at the moment.

1335
01:28:40,151 --> 01:28:42,779
They are an AL-best 17 and 4 this month.

1336
01:28:42,988 --> 01:28:46,754
They also took back-to-back series at Boston and at new York.

1337
01:28:46,958 --> 01:28:49,552
Remember when they traded Jeremy Giambi in June

1338
01:28:49,761 --> 01:28:52,059
and everyone thought they'd just giVen up?

1339
01:28:52,264 --> 01:28:54,892
Actually, not so much.

1340
01:28:59,037 --> 01:29:01,471
Suzanne, get Shapiro on the phone.

1341
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:05,168
You thinking Rincon? His season's done. He's lost faith.

1342
01:29:05,377 --> 01:29:08,346
I think he's gonna dump him. Hard-core.

1343
01:29:08,546 --> 01:29:10,776
Shapiro on 2.

1344
01:29:12,384 --> 01:29:14,113
Mark, Billy. Let's be honest.

1345
01:29:14,319 --> 01:29:17,652
A premier setup man isn't gonna get you closer to the play-offs.

1346
01:29:17,856 --> 01:29:19,756
Are you referring to Rincon?

1347
01:29:19,958 --> 01:29:21,926
He's a luxury you can't afford, man.

1348
01:29:22,127 --> 01:29:24,789
And you can? There's half a million on his contract.

1349
01:29:24,996 --> 01:29:27,021
And we'Ve got at least one other suitor.

1350
01:29:27,232 --> 01:29:29,894
By "at least one," you mean one.

1351
01:29:30,101 --> 01:29:32,535
Who is it? I'd rather not say.

1352
01:29:32,737 --> 01:29:35,001
San Francisco. San Francisco.

1353
01:29:35,206 --> 01:29:36,673
I'll call you back.

1354
01:29:38,510 --> 01:29:40,637
What do you think we can get for Magnante?

1355
01:29:40,845 --> 01:29:42,073
Nothing.

1356
01:29:43,014 --> 01:29:46,040
What's left on Venafro's contract? Two seventy-five.

1357
01:29:46,885 --> 01:29:48,648
Suzanne, get me Sabean on the line.

1358
01:29:48,853 --> 01:29:52,914
Get the Giants interested in Venafro, Mark's only got one buyer for Rincon.

1359
01:29:53,124 --> 01:29:54,523
Us. On 3.

1360
01:29:56,628 --> 01:30:00,064
Saby-Sabster, it's Billy. What do you think of Venafro?

1361
01:30:00,265 --> 01:30:02,392
I can let you have him for almost nothing.

1362
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:05,125
Why would you do that? Because I'm amazing.

1363
01:30:05,337 --> 01:30:07,305
I want a couple bucks and a sweetener.

1364
01:30:07,772 --> 01:30:09,569
Throw in, say...

1365
01:30:09,774 --> 01:30:11,901
Anderson. Anderson.

1366
01:30:12,110 --> 01:30:15,011
I like Anderson. No, you don't. Nobody likes him.

1367
01:30:15,213 --> 01:30:17,704
I don't know why I'm doing this. But let's do it.

1368
01:30:17,916 --> 01:30:20,817
Venafro for Michaelson. Anderson. I don't know his name.

1369
01:30:21,019 --> 01:30:23,852
I'll think about it. Think about it and call me back.

1370
01:30:24,456 --> 01:30:26,424
Get Shapiro on.

1371
01:30:34,366 --> 01:30:36,561
Shapiro's on 2.

1372
01:30:38,670 --> 01:30:40,604
Mark. You can't afford him, Billy.

1373
01:30:40,805 --> 01:30:41,829
You sure about that?

1374
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:44,600
I get the impression the market for Rincon is softening.

1375
01:30:44,809 --> 01:30:46,367
Huh? I could be wrong,

1376
01:30:46,578 --> 01:30:48,170
but I'd call whoever's interested

1377
01:30:48,380 --> 01:30:51,838
and see if they're still interested. Call me back.

1378
01:30:52,751 --> 01:30:56,118
What about the Mets for Venafro? You offered him to the Giants.

1379
01:30:56,321 --> 01:30:57,948
Suzanne, Steve Phillips.

1380
01:30:58,156 --> 01:31:02,923
Between Bonds, Kent, Nen, Snow, San Francisco's never gonna do it.

1381
01:31:03,395 --> 01:31:07,092
Totally agree. We just need them to cool on Rincon.

1382
01:31:07,298 --> 01:31:10,392
Phillips on 2. Steve-o, it's Billy.

1383
01:31:10,602 --> 01:31:14,265
I hear you're looking for a reliever. I can give you Venafro.

1384
01:31:14,472 --> 01:31:17,066
I can make it quick and easy. What's the angle?

1385
01:31:17,275 --> 01:31:20,142
No angle. Who am I getting fleeced for?

1386
01:31:20,812 --> 01:31:24,179
Hang on a sec. Uh, Bennett, maybe?

1387
01:31:24,382 --> 01:31:25,713
How old? Twenty-six.

1388
01:31:25,917 --> 01:31:27,976
Twenty-six, Double-A? Forget it.

1389
01:31:28,186 --> 01:31:30,211
Duncan, no.

1390
01:31:32,056 --> 01:31:33,751
No. Furbush, no.

1391
01:31:36,461 --> 01:31:40,124
Eckerton? Eckerton? Eckerton.

1392
01:31:41,132 --> 01:31:42,121
Eckerton.

1393
01:31:42,333 --> 01:31:44,733
I like Eckerton. You don't even know who Eckerton is.

1394
01:31:46,137 --> 01:31:48,662
Is Venafro hurt? No, he's fine, he's fine.

1395
01:31:48,873 --> 01:31:50,135
It's just an issue for us.

1396
01:31:50,341 --> 01:31:53,003
Last couple times, he got hammered. Not his fault.

1397
01:31:53,211 --> 01:31:55,338
That was us. We misused him. It's Steve.

1398
01:31:55,547 --> 01:31:57,515
 I'm almost done. Steve Schott.

1399
01:31:57,949 --> 01:32:00,884
 Look, Steve-o, let me be straight with you.

1400
01:32:01,085 --> 01:32:03,849
Here's the deal. I'm getting Rincon. It's a done deal.

1401
01:32:04,055 --> 01:32:07,081
I heard the Giants... Giants want Venafro for Michaelson.

1402
01:32:07,292 --> 01:32:09,157
Anderson. I'd rather deal with you.

1403
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:12,352
You can give me Eckerton and $225,000 in cash,

1404
01:32:12,564 --> 01:32:14,555
and the Giants can't.

1405
01:32:15,433 --> 01:32:17,424
I'll think about it. Think about it.

1406
01:32:17,635 --> 01:32:19,967
But whoever calls me back first gets Venafro.

1407
01:32:22,440 --> 01:32:23,600
Schott hung up.

1408
01:32:25,109 --> 01:32:28,374
Oh, I want this one.

1409
01:32:36,387 --> 01:32:38,685
Why isn't anybody calling?

1410
01:32:41,526 --> 01:32:43,721
Shapiro's on 2.

1411
01:32:45,129 --> 01:32:46,494
Yeah?

1412
01:32:50,702 --> 01:32:53,296
Okay, let me talk to my owner. I'll call you back.

1413
01:32:53,505 --> 01:32:56,167
Get Steve on the phone. Schott or Phillips?

1414
01:32:56,374 --> 01:32:59,207
Why would we call Phillips? Phillips has gotta call us.

1415
01:33:03,114 --> 01:33:04,809
Tell him I'm on the other line.

1416
01:33:08,586 --> 01:33:12,215
Hi, Mr. Schott, it's Peter Brand. I apologize for putting you on hold.

1417
01:33:12,423 --> 01:33:17,190
Billy asked me to call you back. Tell him we want 225,000 for Rincon.

1418
01:33:17,395 --> 01:33:22,389
Billy says he needs $225,000 for Ricardo Rincon.

1419
01:33:23,001 --> 01:33:24,559
Please.

1420
01:33:26,137 --> 01:33:29,368
Yes, I added the "please" at the end.

1421
01:33:30,775 --> 01:33:34,006
Okay. Let me... Hold on one second, please.

1422
01:33:34,846 --> 01:33:36,814
 Tell him I'll pay for him.

1423
01:33:37,015 --> 01:33:41,315
But when I sell him back for twice the amount next year, I keep the money.

1424
01:33:43,321 --> 01:33:46,290
Okay, so Billy says he'll pay for Rincon himself.

1425
01:33:46,491 --> 01:33:50,723
But when he sells him for more money next year, he's keeping the profit.

1426
01:34:00,705 --> 01:34:03,367
Thank you very much. We'll call you back. Thank you.

1427
01:34:03,575 --> 01:34:06,009
Come on. Come on.

1428
01:34:11,349 --> 01:34:15,115
 Suzanne, call Shapiro ba... Never mind, I got him right here.

1429
01:34:17,956 --> 01:34:19,719
Mark. Yeah.

1430
01:34:19,924 --> 01:34:22,825
Listen, I don't want Rincon pitching against me tonight.

1431
01:34:23,027 --> 01:34:26,463
Tell him to change clothes and send him over. I got you the money.

1432
01:34:26,664 --> 01:34:28,063
Yup.

1433
01:34:28,266 --> 01:34:29,665
Great.

1434
01:34:33,838 --> 01:34:37,797
I don't wanna dampen the mood at all, but since we picked up Rincon...

1435
01:34:38,009 --> 01:34:40,239
We gotta send someone down.

1436
01:34:46,985 --> 01:34:49,977
Mags. Hey, Billy.

1437
01:34:52,991 --> 01:34:54,822
I know I've been struggling lately.

1438
01:34:55,026 --> 01:34:58,757
But second half of the season, definitely turn it around. Ricky and l...

1439
01:34:58,963 --> 01:35:02,865
Mike, I need you to stop getting dressed.

1440
01:35:05,436 --> 01:35:06,994
Traded?

1441
01:35:17,882 --> 01:35:20,282
I'm sorry for the crap news.

1442
01:35:21,085 --> 01:35:22,985
I know it hurts.

1443
01:35:33,264 --> 01:35:36,028
Mike, I can't have 26 guys in the clubhouse.

1444
01:35:36,234 --> 01:35:39,169
I get it. I get it.

1445
01:35:40,405 --> 01:35:43,602
Okay. Thanks.

1446
01:35:57,889 --> 01:35:59,151
Hey, Ricardo.

1447
01:36:01,392 --> 01:36:03,986
This must be a bit of a shock, I guess.

1448
01:36:04,629 --> 01:36:06,893
 Mabry hits one deep to right-center field.

1449
01:36:07,098 --> 01:36:09,066
Racing back, Fick can't get it.

1450
01:36:09,267 --> 01:36:12,862
It bounces to the wall. One run is in. Two runs are in.

1451
01:36:13,337 --> 01:36:16,602
Mabry, on one pitch, has shot the A 's in front.

1452
01:36:16,808 --> 01:36:21,108
Strike three called. TwelVe straight wins for the Athletics.

1453
01:36:21,312 --> 01:36:22,677
Man aliVe, was it hairy.

1454
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:25,246
Something strange is now happening in Oakland.

1455
01:36:25,450 --> 01:36:27,850
You cannot argue that point.  TwelVe straight.

1456
01:36:28,052 --> 01:36:30,919
They're making a joke out of the American League.

1457
01:36:31,122 --> 01:36:33,682
They were in Detroit today...  He throws to first.

1458
01:36:33,891 --> 01:36:37,383
And that's the sound of 14 straight Victories.

1459
01:36:37,595 --> 01:36:39,620
Fourteen, the longest run this year.

1460
01:36:39,831 --> 01:36:42,857
It has slingshot the A 's into first in the AL West. A nice streak.

1461
01:36:43,067 --> 01:36:44,864
This team was written off.

1462
01:36:45,069 --> 01:36:48,505
How do you explain, otherwise, the Victories they'Ve come up with?

1463
01:36:48,706 --> 01:36:52,198
The Oakland A 's are gonna win 16 consecutiVe games.

1464
01:36:53,277 --> 01:36:59,307
This is the longest win streak in baseball, folks, in 25 years.

1465
01:36:59,517 --> 01:37:01,280
The A 's haVe won 16 in a row.

1466
01:37:01,486 --> 01:37:04,046
We're going to 20! We're going to 20!

1467
01:37:04,255 --> 01:37:08,453
To haVe a winning streak of this duration, you haVe to be good,

1468
01:37:08,659 --> 01:37:11,560
but there's an element of randomness to it.

1469
01:37:11,763 --> 01:37:13,924
The 1927 Yankees, Ruth, Gehrig,

1470
01:37:14,132 --> 01:37:17,226
Murderers' Row, some people still say the best team ever.

1471
01:37:17,435 --> 01:37:20,927
Longest winning streak for them that year? Nine.

1472
01:37:21,139 --> 01:37:24,108
You guys try to analyze it from a numbers standpoint.

1473
01:37:24,308 --> 01:37:28,335
I'm telling you, there is no explanation for what's occurring right now.

1474
01:37:28,546 --> 01:37:30,377
Do you haVe superstitions going on?

1475
01:37:30,581 --> 01:37:32,879
Do you do things so you keep the streak aliVe?

1476
01:37:33,084 --> 01:37:36,576
The all-time record of 20 does not seem impossible anymore.

1477
01:37:36,788 --> 01:37:39,086
The A 's were on page one of the New York Times.

1478
01:37:39,290 --> 01:37:42,623
They are the story in sports in this entire country.

1479
01:37:42,827 --> 01:37:44,158
Two-two pitch, here it is.

1480
01:37:44,362 --> 01:37:48,423
Swing and a miss! Struck him out! Number 17!

1481
01:37:48,633 --> 01:37:51,534
It's taken 71 years.

1482
01:37:51,736 --> 01:37:54,603
The Oakland A 's haVe tied the Philadelphia A 's.

1483
01:37:54,806 --> 01:37:58,674
The all-time franchise record 17 straight

1484
01:37:58,876 --> 01:38:04,109
and baseball's longest winning streak since 1953.

1485
01:38:04,315 --> 01:38:08,217
The A 's are two wins away from tying the American League record.

1486
01:38:08,419 --> 01:38:14,051
It's gone! It's gone! Tejada wins it! Do you believe it?

1487
01:38:14,559 --> 01:38:16,686
Eighteen wins in a row!

1488
01:38:16,894 --> 01:38:19,795
You could replay these 18 games a hundred times oVer.

1489
01:38:19,997 --> 01:38:21,862
And nobody wins 18 straight again.

1490
01:38:22,066 --> 01:38:24,591
It defies everything we know about baseball.

1491
01:38:25,069 --> 01:38:28,368
The most amazing thing you could imagine

1492
01:38:28,573 --> 01:38:31,508
happened oVer the last four days at the coliseum.

1493
01:38:31,709 --> 01:38:37,238
Tejada, up the middle. The A 's haVe won 19 in a row!

1494
01:38:38,182 --> 01:38:40,707
The 1906 White Sox,

1495
01:38:40,918 --> 01:38:44,911
the 1947 new York Yankees haVe company.

1496
01:38:46,190 --> 01:38:47,657
Nineteen in a row.

1497
01:38:47,859 --> 01:38:50,726
The A 's haVe a date with destiny.

1498
01:38:50,928 --> 01:38:53,954
They're going for the all-time American League record,

1499
01:38:54,165 --> 01:38:55,223
20 games in a row.

1500
01:38:55,433 --> 01:38:59,699
We're going to 20! We're gonna take the AL record to 20, baby!

1501
01:39:02,640 --> 01:39:04,437
Don't tell me the score, Pete.

1502
01:39:04,642 --> 01:39:05,973
No, Billy, it's me.

1503
01:39:06,177 --> 01:39:08,372
Sharon? Yeah.

1504
01:39:09,614 --> 01:39:12,742
You haVe a second? Yeah, what's up?

1505
01:39:12,950 --> 01:39:15,316
Well, I didn't actually expect you to pick up.

1506
01:39:15,519 --> 01:39:17,282
I was gonna leaVe a message.

1507
01:39:17,488 --> 01:39:21,288
Um, casey and I, we're here and watching the game at home.

1508
01:39:21,492 --> 01:39:25,087
And I just wanted to say...

1509
01:39:26,497 --> 01:39:28,192
you did good, Billy.

1510
01:39:28,399 --> 01:39:30,390
We're really proud of you.

1511
01:39:31,936 --> 01:39:34,234
I appreciate it, Sharon.

1512
01:39:34,438 --> 01:39:37,271
Thank you. Good luck.

1513
01:39:38,109 --> 01:39:39,098
Okay.

1514
01:39:39,310 --> 01:39:41,608
Oh, casey wants to talk to you. Hang on.

1515
01:39:42,446 --> 01:39:44,209
Are you on your way to the stadium?

1516
01:39:44,415 --> 01:39:47,407
No, I'm on my way to Visalia to see our minor-league team.

1517
01:39:47,618 --> 01:39:50,348
Turn around, please, Dad. No way, Jose.

1518
01:39:50,554 --> 01:39:53,216
Turn around. Come on, Dad. Nope. Not gonna happen.

1519
01:39:53,424 --> 01:39:54,721
You're not gonna jinx it.

1520
01:39:54,926 --> 01:39:58,453
I'll talk to you later, sweetheart. I love you.

1521
01:40:05,002 --> 01:40:06,367
Shit.

1522
01:40:06,570 --> 01:40:09,664
One out here in the fourth, and if you're just joining us,

1523
01:40:09,874 --> 01:40:10,898
you missed a lot.

1524
01:40:11,108 --> 01:40:14,100
And the pitch to Raul Ibanez. Strike one.

1525
01:40:14,312 --> 01:40:15,973
I think my recap will be simple.

1526
01:40:16,180 --> 01:40:19,809
The A 's scored six in the first, one in the second, four in the third.

1527
01:40:20,017 --> 01:40:23,578
 And people would be shocked if you just did that. Heh-heh-heh.

1528
01:40:23,788 --> 01:40:25,983
Eleven to nothing, the A 's do lead.

1529
01:40:26,190 --> 01:40:28,886
Shit. Foul off the foot of Ibanez...

1530
01:40:51,382 --> 01:40:53,976
Let's go, Oakland!

1531
01:40:54,185 --> 01:40:56,710
Let's go, Oakland!

1532
01:40:56,921 --> 01:40:59,481
Let's go, Oakland!

1533
01:41:04,962 --> 01:41:11,026
Now batting, number 2, catcher, Brent Mayne.

1534
01:41:15,206 --> 01:41:19,142
Oakland! Here we go, Oakland!

1535
01:41:27,752 --> 01:41:29,310
Two.

1536
01:41:30,988 --> 01:41:32,615
Safe.

1537
01:41:38,029 --> 01:41:39,462
Now batting,

1538
01:41:39,663 --> 01:41:45,260
number 18, left fielder Raul Ibanez.

1539
01:42:46,464 --> 01:42:48,022
Safe.

1540
01:42:50,468 --> 01:42:52,834
And the A 's now lead by a score of 11 to 3.

1541
01:42:53,037 --> 01:42:55,801
A nice cushion, but you don't wanna giVe teams life

1542
01:42:56,006 --> 01:42:58,634
and let them wedge their way back in, even when you're...

1543
01:43:42,686 --> 01:43:44,381
Nobody out, the bases loaded.

1544
01:43:44,588 --> 01:43:47,887
And Art Howe on the way to the mound to make a pitching change.

1545
01:43:48,092 --> 01:43:49,957
And this game is still in a state

1546
01:43:50,161 --> 01:43:53,028
where it could get out of control for the Athletics.

1547
01:43:59,770 --> 01:44:02,967
We're all told at some point we can no longer play the children's game.

1548
01:44:03,174 --> 01:44:06,735
We just don't know when that's gonna be.

1549
01:44:10,347 --> 01:44:15,785
Some of us are told at 18, some of us are told at 40, but we're all told.

1550
01:44:15,986 --> 01:44:18,284
Mike Sweeney with runners at first and third.

1551
01:44:18,489 --> 01:44:20,855
It's an 11-to-7 game, the A 's in front.

1552
01:44:21,058 --> 01:44:23,754
Tam peering in for the sign.

1553
01:44:23,961 --> 01:44:26,896
Two out. Runners at first and third.

1554
01:44:27,097 --> 01:44:29,531
And the 3-2 deliVery.

1555
01:45:03,334 --> 01:45:05,598
It's weird, Billy.

1556
01:45:05,803 --> 01:45:09,830
You wanna giVe up baseball to become a scout?

1557
01:45:11,208 --> 01:45:13,574
I'm not a baseball player.

1558
01:45:14,044 --> 01:45:16,444
Are you sure this is what you want?

1559
01:45:17,848 --> 01:45:22,376
The crowd is roaring. Koch is ready. One-two pitch.

1560
01:45:22,886 --> 01:45:26,117
Alicea puts it in play, a looper to left field for a base hit.

1561
01:45:26,323 --> 01:45:29,724
Around third, tearing for the plate, here comes the tying run.

1562
01:45:29,960 --> 01:45:33,919
Sliding safe. And the ball game is tied at 11-all.

1563
01:45:34,131 --> 01:45:35,723
Holy Toledo.

1564
01:45:37,067 --> 01:45:41,299
The A 's haVe blown an 11-to-nothing lead.

1565
01:45:43,107 --> 01:45:47,168
This is the specter of a development that has been lurking now

1566
01:45:47,645 --> 01:45:51,741
ever since the fiVe-run fourth inning by the Royals.

1567
01:45:51,949 --> 01:45:57,353
And the A 's date with destiny is on hold right now.

1568
01:46:22,980 --> 01:46:26,211
Hatteberg. Hattie.

1569
01:46:26,750 --> 01:46:29,184
Grab a bat. You're hitting for Byrnesy.

1570
01:46:30,721 --> 01:46:34,054
Come on, let's go. Get yourself loose.

1571
01:46:44,435 --> 01:46:48,269
Hitting for Eric Byrnes,

1572
01:46:48,472 --> 01:46:52,602
number 10, Scott Hatteberg.

1573
01:47:00,784 --> 01:47:04,345
In your typical A 's fashion. They want a base runner here.

1574
01:47:04,555 --> 01:47:08,252
Scott Hatteberg is so adept at drawing walks.

1575
01:47:11,495 --> 01:47:13,725
He's looking for Hatteberg to get on base,

1576
01:47:13,931 --> 01:47:15,899
maybe bring in a pinch runner.

1577
01:47:16,100 --> 01:47:18,500
Let's go, Oakland!

1578
01:47:18,702 --> 01:47:20,727
Let's go, Oakland!

1579
01:48:15,592 --> 01:48:17,355
That one is gone!

1580
01:48:17,561 --> 01:48:21,998
And it's 20 consecutiVe Victories for the Oakland Athletics

1581
01:48:22,199 --> 01:48:24,190
on an unbelieVable night

1582
01:48:24,401 --> 01:48:27,029
when they lost an 11-to-nothing lead

1583
01:48:27,237 --> 01:48:28,704
and now they win it.

1584
01:48:30,941 --> 01:48:35,401
The crowd comes back to insane life.

1585
01:48:37,347 --> 01:48:39,315
How do you explain it?

1586
01:48:40,317 --> 01:48:44,617
Crazy. Just plain crazy.

1587
01:48:48,759 --> 01:48:52,286
Hatteberg is mobbed at home plate.

1588
01:48:55,566 --> 01:48:58,501
In 103 years of American League baseball,

1589
01:48:58,702 --> 01:49:02,138
the Athletics haVe accomplished what no one has before.

1590
01:49:02,339 --> 01:49:06,537
They haVe won 20 consecutiVe games.

1591
01:49:32,569 --> 01:49:35,333
It's hard not to be romantic about baseball.

1592
01:49:37,241 --> 01:49:40,472
This kind of thing, it's fun for the fans.

1593
01:49:41,411 --> 01:49:44,812
It sells tickets and hot dogs.

1594
01:49:46,149 --> 01:49:47,707
Doesn't mean anything.

1595
01:49:47,918 --> 01:49:51,513
Billy, we just won 20 games in a row.

1596
01:49:53,290 --> 01:49:55,281
And what's the point?

1597
01:49:55,492 --> 01:49:58,120
We just got the record.

1598
01:50:01,064 --> 01:50:03,430
Man, I've been doing this for...

1599
01:50:09,473 --> 01:50:11,498
Listen, man.

1600
01:50:11,708 --> 01:50:15,144
I've been in this game a long time.

1601
01:50:16,780 --> 01:50:19,510
I'm not in it for a record, I'll tell you that.

1602
01:50:19,716 --> 01:50:21,809
I'm not in it for a ring.

1603
01:50:24,521 --> 01:50:26,716
That's when people get hurt.

1604
01:50:28,392 --> 01:50:31,293
If we don't win the last game of the Series,

1605
01:50:32,563 --> 01:50:34,554
they'll dismiss us.

1606
01:50:35,165 --> 01:50:36,564
Billy... I know these guys.

1607
01:50:36,767 --> 01:50:39,634
I know the way they think, and they will erase us.

1608
01:50:41,138 --> 01:50:43,606
And everything we've done here,

1609
01:50:43,807 --> 01:50:45,707
none of it'll matter.

1610
01:50:48,812 --> 01:50:52,111
Any other team wins the World Series, good for them.

1611
01:50:53,350 --> 01:50:56,649
They're drinking champagne, they get a ring.

1612
01:50:56,853 --> 01:50:58,753
But if we win,

1613
01:50:59,389 --> 01:51:02,017
on our budget, with this team...

1614
01:51:05,829 --> 01:51:07,854
we'll have changed the game.

1615
01:51:08,699 --> 01:51:10,792
And that's what I want.

1616
01:51:11,001 --> 01:51:13,231
I want it to mean something.

1617
01:51:22,913 --> 01:51:27,009
 The A 's going to the play-offs with the West DiVision title.

1618
01:51:27,217 --> 01:51:29,913
ForgiVe the A 's if they're not celebrating.

1619
01:51:30,120 --> 01:51:31,610
They haVe been here before,

1620
01:51:31,822 --> 01:51:35,519
when Oakland went up two games to none on the Yanks in the ALDS,

1621
01:51:35,726 --> 01:51:38,194
and went nowhere after losing three straight.

1622
01:51:38,395 --> 01:51:41,660
With a win today oVer the Twins, Oakland moVes into the ALcS

1623
01:51:41,865 --> 01:51:44,493
for the first time since 1992.

1624
01:51:44,701 --> 01:51:46,396
But remember one thing.

1625
01:51:46,603 --> 01:51:50,403
Percentages hold up oVer a season, but for one game, one at bat,

1626
01:51:50,607 --> 01:51:53,098
throw the percentages out the window.

1627
01:52:25,942 --> 01:52:30,436
What the Minnesota Twins exposed is the fact that the Oakland A 's

1628
01:52:30,647 --> 01:52:34,378
were fundamentally not a sound baseball team.

1629
01:52:34,584 --> 01:52:38,042
They had a flawed concept that started with the general manager

1630
01:52:38,255 --> 01:52:41,713
and the brain trust thinking they could reinVent baseball.

1631
01:52:41,925 --> 01:52:43,483
You can't approach baseball

1632
01:52:43,694 --> 01:52:46,322
from a statistical, bean-counting point of View.

1633
01:52:46,530 --> 01:52:48,760
It's won on the field with fundamental play.

1634
01:52:48,965 --> 01:52:51,991
You haVe to steal, you haVe to bunt, you haVe to sacrifice.

1635
01:52:52,202 --> 01:52:55,763
You gotta get men in scoring position, and you gotta bring them in.

1636
01:52:55,972 --> 01:53:00,375
And you don't do that with a bunch of statistical gimmicks.

1637
01:53:00,577 --> 01:53:03,375
Nobody reinVents this game.

1638
01:53:46,623 --> 01:53:48,022
Yeah.

1639
01:54:56,593 --> 01:55:02,054
Due respect to the Coliseum, but this is a ballpark.

1640
01:55:02,265 --> 01:55:04,233
Yes, it is.

1641
01:55:06,336 --> 01:55:08,566
We're gonna have some lunch in a little bit.

1642
01:55:08,772 --> 01:55:10,967
Why don't I have some coffee sent up?

1643
01:55:11,675 --> 01:55:13,370
Denise?

1644
01:55:18,048 --> 01:55:19,879
Thank you, Denise.

1645
01:55:20,083 --> 01:55:22,108
Thanks. You're welcome.

1646
01:55:25,088 --> 01:55:28,717
You know, it's her birthday and I need to get her a present,

1647
01:55:28,925 --> 01:55:31,860
but she's usually the one that does that for me.

1648
01:55:32,596 --> 01:55:34,894
So do you have any ideas?

1649
01:55:35,498 --> 01:55:36,829
Scarf.

1650
01:55:37,033 --> 01:55:38,466
You mean like wool?

1651
01:55:38,668 --> 01:55:43,571
No, I meant what women wear with... You know, decorative.

1652
01:55:43,773 --> 01:55:46,765
Ah. And where would I get something like that?

1653
01:55:47,744 --> 01:55:51,043
No disrespect, I just lost in five for the second year in a row.

1654
01:55:51,248 --> 01:55:53,546
Get her a bowling ball for all I care.

1655
01:55:53,750 --> 01:55:55,115
Right.

1656
01:55:56,052 --> 01:55:59,544
Well, Steve told me he's offering you a new contract.

1657
01:56:01,057 --> 01:56:02,718
Yes.

1658
01:56:02,926 --> 01:56:05,554
So why did you return my call?

1659
01:56:07,697 --> 01:56:10,222
Because it's the Red Sox.

1660
01:56:10,433 --> 01:56:14,927
Because I believe science might offer an answer to the Curse of the Bambino.

1661
01:56:15,672 --> 01:56:20,905
Because I hear you hired Bill James. Yup.

1662
01:56:21,111 --> 01:56:25,775
You know, why someone took so long to hire that guy is beyond me.

1663
01:56:26,783 --> 01:56:29,081
Well, baseball hates him.

1664
01:56:29,686 --> 01:56:34,350
Well, baseball can hate him, you know.

1665
01:56:34,557 --> 01:56:38,493
One of the great things about money is that it buys a lot of things,

1666
01:56:38,695 --> 01:56:42,187
one of which is the luxury to disregard what baseball likes,

1667
01:56:42,399 --> 01:56:45,300
doesn't like, what baseball thinks, doesn't think.

1668
01:56:46,970 --> 01:56:49,564
Ah. Sounds nice.

1669
01:56:50,307 --> 01:56:51,672
Well...

1670
01:56:52,342 --> 01:56:54,367
I was grateful for the call.

1671
01:56:54,577 --> 01:56:56,408
You were grateful? Yeah.

1672
01:56:59,683 --> 01:57:03,551
For 41 million, you built a play-off team.

1673
01:57:03,753 --> 01:57:08,019
You lost Damon, Giambi, Isringhausen, Pena,

1674
01:57:08,491 --> 01:57:11,858
and you won more games without them than you did with them.

1675
01:57:12,062 --> 01:57:15,429
You won the exact same number of games that the Yankees won,

1676
01:57:15,632 --> 01:57:19,500
but the Yankees spent 1.4 million per win,

1677
01:57:19,703 --> 01:57:23,139
and you paid 260,000.

1678
01:57:23,340 --> 01:57:27,367
I know you're taking it in the teeth, but the first guy through the wall,

1679
01:57:27,844 --> 01:57:29,971
he always gets bloody.

1680
01:57:30,180 --> 01:57:33,547
Always. This is threatening not just a way of doing business,

1681
01:57:33,750 --> 01:57:36,241
but in their minds, it's threatening the game.

1682
01:57:36,453 --> 01:57:39,718
Really, what it's threatening is their livelihood, their jobs.

1683
01:57:39,923 --> 01:57:42,892
It's threatening the way that they do things.

1684
01:57:43,093 --> 01:57:44,424
Every time that happens,

1685
01:57:44,627 --> 01:57:48,085
whether it's a government, a way of doing business, whatever,

1686
01:57:48,298 --> 01:57:50,789
the people who are holding the reins,

1687
01:57:51,001 --> 01:57:53,526
they have their hands on the switch,

1688
01:57:53,737 --> 01:57:56,205
they go batshit crazy.

1689
01:57:57,273 --> 01:58:02,074
I mean, anybody who's not tearing their team down right now

1690
01:58:02,278 --> 01:58:05,338
and rebuilding it using your model,

1691
01:58:06,282 --> 01:58:08,045
they're dinosaurs.

1692
01:58:08,685 --> 01:58:13,088
They'll be sitting on their ass on the sofa in October

1693
01:58:13,289 --> 01:58:16,747
watching the Boston Red Sox win the World Series.

1694
01:58:22,165 --> 01:58:24,030
What's this?

1695
01:58:24,234 --> 01:58:27,692
I want you to be my general manager. That's my offer.

1696
01:59:14,684 --> 01:59:16,117
Heads up.

1697
01:59:17,821 --> 01:59:18,810
What was that?

1698
01:59:20,090 --> 01:59:23,116
Sorry. I don't know. What the hell was that?

1699
01:59:23,860 --> 01:59:26,124
You knucklehead.

1700
01:59:33,703 --> 01:59:35,000
How was Boston?

1701
01:59:36,573 --> 01:59:38,438
Impressive.

1702
01:59:44,914 --> 01:59:47,508
Did Henry make you a good offer, at least?

1703
01:59:49,085 --> 01:59:52,111
Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter. What was it? What was it?

1704
01:59:52,322 --> 01:59:53,914
Doesn't matter. What was it?

1705
02:00:17,013 --> 02:00:20,471
That makes you the highest-paid GM in the history of sports.

1706
02:00:22,952 --> 02:00:24,385
So?

1707
02:00:26,222 --> 02:00:27,416
So what?

1708
02:00:30,493 --> 02:00:32,927
I made one decision in my life based on money.

1709
02:00:33,129 --> 02:00:36,030
And I swore I would never do it again.

1710
02:00:38,668 --> 02:00:40,659
You're not doing it for the money.

1711
02:00:41,204 --> 02:00:43,672
No? No.

1712
02:00:45,708 --> 02:00:48,199
You're doing it for what the money says.

1713
02:00:49,679 --> 02:00:53,342
And it says what it says to any player that makes big money.

1714
02:00:54,050 --> 02:00:55,779
That they're worth it.

1715
02:01:04,260 --> 02:01:05,955
What a dump.

1716
02:01:10,166 --> 02:01:12,464
I really wanted to win here.

1717
02:01:16,539 --> 02:01:19,030
I really did.

1718
02:01:21,578 --> 02:01:23,705
I think you won pretty big, Billy.

1719
02:01:24,581 --> 02:01:26,674
Pete, we lost.

1720
02:01:28,318 --> 02:01:30,843
We lost.

1721
02:01:31,054 --> 02:01:34,490
It's only been a few days. Give yourself some time to get over it.

1722
02:01:34,691 --> 02:01:37,990
Man, I don't get over these things.

1723
02:01:38,194 --> 02:01:39,286
Ever.

1724
02:01:46,336 --> 02:01:49,965
Come with me to the video room. I wanna show you something.

1725
02:01:51,741 --> 02:01:55,006
No, man, I'm not up for film right now.

1726
02:01:56,279 --> 02:01:58,338
Come on. Seriously.

1727
02:01:58,548 --> 02:02:00,675
Come on, Billy. Come on.

1728
02:02:02,418 --> 02:02:03,510
The Visalia Oaks

1729
02:02:03,720 --> 02:02:06,484
and our 240-pound catcher, Jeremy Brown,

1730
02:02:06,689 --> 02:02:10,250
who, as you know, is scared to run to second base.

1731
02:02:10,460 --> 02:02:12,223
This was in a game six weeks ago.

1732
02:02:12,829 --> 02:02:14,922
This guy's gonna start with a fastball.

1733
02:02:15,131 --> 02:02:17,531
Jeremy's gonna take him to deep center.

1734
02:02:19,736 --> 02:02:21,203
Here's what's interesting,

1735
02:02:21,404 --> 02:02:24,237
because Jeremy's gonna do what he never does.

1736
02:02:24,440 --> 02:02:25,702
He's gonna go for it.

1737
02:02:25,908 --> 02:02:29,105
He's gonna round first and he's gonna go for it.

1738
02:02:30,380 --> 02:02:31,608
Okay?

1739
02:02:34,951 --> 02:02:39,888
This is all of Jeremy's nightmares coming to life.

1740
02:02:42,392 --> 02:02:45,759
Aw, they're laughing at him. And Jeremy's about to find out why.

1741
02:02:48,965 --> 02:02:51,297
Jeremy's about to realize

1742
02:02:52,802 --> 02:02:55,896
that the ball went 60 feet over the fence.

1743
02:02:58,541 --> 02:03:02,136
He hit a home run and didn't even realize it.

1744
02:03:32,175 --> 02:03:35,167
How can you not be romantic about baseball?

1745
02:03:40,149 --> 02:03:43,016
It's a metaphor. I know it's a metaphor.

1746
02:03:47,790 --> 02:03:49,121
Okay.

1747
02:03:53,229 --> 02:03:56,221
Pete, you're a good egg.

1748
02:03:59,702 --> 02:04:01,397
I'll call you.

1749
02:05:02,265 --> 02:05:05,792
Hey, Dad, this is the song I told you I'd record.

1750
02:05:06,002 --> 02:05:08,698
Please don't show it to anyone else.

1751
02:05:08,905 --> 02:05:11,931
Let me know if you change your mind and stay in california.

1752
02:05:12,141 --> 02:05:15,133
If not, you're a really great dad.
