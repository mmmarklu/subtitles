
11
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:01,760
Hello, friend.

12
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:04,990
"Hello, friend." That's lame.

13
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:08,990
Maybe I should give you a name, but that's a slippery slope.

14
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:11,990
You're only in my head. We have to remember that.

15
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,720
Shit. It's actually happened,

16
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,990
I'm talking to an imaginary person.

17
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:20,990
What I'm about to tell you is top secret,

18
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:23,990
a conspiracy bigger than all of us.

19
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:25,990
There's a powerful groupof people out there

20
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:29,990
that are secretly running the world.

21
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:31,990
I'm talking about the guys no one knows about,

22
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,990
the guys that are invisible.

23
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:36,990
The top 1% of the top 1%,

24
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:41,610
the guys that play God without permission.

25
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,420
And now I think they're following me.

26
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:54,990
This is about last night.

27
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,990
I should've gone to Angela's birthday party.

28
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:59,990
Instead, I went to--

29
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:08,990
Hey, Ron.

30
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,990
There you go.

31
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:52,990
You're Ron.

32
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:00,990
But your real name is Rohit Mehta.

33
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:01,990
You changed it to Ron when you bought

34
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:05,990
your first Ron's Coffee Shop six years ago.

35
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:09,990
Now you got 17 of 'em,with 8 more coming next quarter.

36
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:14,000
May I help you with something?

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,990
I like coming here 'cause your Wi-Fi was fast.

38
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:18,990
I mean, you're one of the few spots

39
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,990
that has a fiber connection with gigabit speed.

40
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:24,990
It's good. So good, it scratched

41
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:29,990
that part of my mind, part that doesn't allow good to exist

42
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:32,990
without condition,so I started intercepting

43
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,990
all the traffic on your network.

44
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:37,990
That's when I noticed something strange.

45
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:41,990
It's when I decided to hack you.

46
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:42,520
- Hack--

47
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,900
-I know you run a website called Plato's Boys.

48
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,140
- Pardon me?

49
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,650
You're using Tor networking

50
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:48,990
to keep the servers anonymous.

51
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:51,180
You made it really hard for anyone to see it,

52
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,500
but I saw it.

53
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,620
The onion routing protocol,

54
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,990
it's not as anonymous  as you think it is.

55
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,990
Whoever's in control of the exit nodes

56
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:00,990
is also in control of the traffic,

57
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:04,990
which makes me... the one in control.

58
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,990
I must ask you to kindly leave.

59
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:09,990
I own everything.

60
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:12,990
All your emails. All your files.

61
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,990
All your...pics.

62
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:20,990
Get out of here right now, or I'll call the--

63
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:22,990
Police? You want them to find out

64
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:24,990
about the 100 terabytes of child pornography

65
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:27,990
you serve to your 400,000 users?

66
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:31,990
Personally, man, I was hoping it was just gonna be

67
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:34,990
some BDSM stuff.

68
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,990
You realize how much simpler that would have been?

69
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:44,990
I did not hurt anyone.

70
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,990
I never did.

71
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:54,990
That's my... personal life.

72
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:02,990
I understand what it's like

73
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:05,990
to be different.

74
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:09,990
I'm very different too.

75
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:14,990
I mean, I don't jerk off to little kids, but...

76
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:18,990
I don't know how to talk to people.

77
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:21,990
My dad was the only one I could talk to.

78
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,990
But he died.

79
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:34,990
I'm sorry to hear that.

80
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,490
How did he pass,

81
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:36,990
may I ask?

82
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,990
Leukemia.

83
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:43,560
He definitely got it from radiation

84
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,700
at the company he worked at,

85
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,990
though I couldn't prove it.

86
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:49,990
Now he's dead.

87
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,000
Company's fine, though.

88
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,990
Oh...hey.

89
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,990
It's okay, Rohit.

90
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:05,990
You don't have to worry anymore.

91
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:07,990
I don't understand.

92
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:12,000
Are you blackmailing me?

93
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,990
So that's what this is about...

94
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:16,990
money.

95
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:20,990
That's all you care about, huh?

96
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,990
No.

97
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,990
If I pay you now,you'll want more and more.

98
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:31,990
No matter how much I give.

99
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:34,990
You will inform the police anyway.

100
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:36,990
I won't pay you, sir.

101
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,990
Remember, you also broke the law.

102
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:44,990
Actually, you're right.

103
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,000
Partly.

104
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,700
See, I usually do this kind of thing

105
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:50,990
from my computer,

106
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,990
but this time I wanted to do it  AFK.

107
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,990
In person.

108
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,990
Trying to work on my social anxiety.

109
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,420
But there's always the threat of you fleeing

110
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,860
after I call you out.

111
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,680
You'd tell your sys admin

112
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,400
to take your servers down,wipe all the data.

113
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,990
So I made sure to include

114
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:11,140
the current time and location

115
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,990
on my anonymous tip.

116
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:13,990
Wait. Hold on.

117
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:14,810
I'll give you the money.

118
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:15,980
I'll pay you.

119
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:15,990
How much do you want?
I'll pay you.

120
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:16,620
How much do you want?

121
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,990
I'll pay you.

122
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,090
That's the part you were wrong about, Rohit.

123
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:24,990
I don't give a shit about money.

124
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,990
Now I'm being followed.

125
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:47,450
The higher ups don't like someone with my powers.

126
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:48,370
In three short minutes,

127
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:51,140
I destroyed a man's business,life, existence.

128
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:52,850
- I deleted him.

129
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:53,300
- Hey!

130
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,970
Hey, you.

131
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:57,000
Hey, kiddo.

132
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,990
What's happening?

133
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:07,990
Exciting time in the world right now.

134
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,990
Exciting time.

135
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,730
But I'm only a vigilante hacker by night.

136
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:36,900
By day, just a regular

137
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,440
cyber security engineer,

138
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:42,990
employee number ER28-0652.

139
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,000
Elliot!

140
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,990
In here.

141
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:53,000
- What's up?

142
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,990
- El.

143
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,100
Yeah, I can totally-- I can totally handle it.

144
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:04,940
They were hacked again.

145
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:05,990
Last night.

146
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,990
Gideon...

147
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:09,990
That's my childhood friend Angela.

148
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,930
She can be a bit high strung sometimes,

149
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,990
but trust me-- she's one of the good ones.

150
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:14,990
What am I looking at?

151
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:15,780
Is this the log file?

152
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,990
This was a RUDY attack.

153
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:19,570
This is awesome.

154
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:21,170
- Gideon, will you answer me?

155
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:21,170
- Awesome?

156
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:23,220
You think this is awesome? This is killing us, Elliot.

157
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,260
- Gideon, I'm not-- - Angela!

158
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,990
Let's just see how this meeting goes today.

159
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,880
Their networks are getting attacked every week.

160
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,990
Who knows if they'll still even be a client.

161
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,700
They're coming in? Hey, what did we say

162
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,990
about the dress code?

163
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,320
All right, now,look over those logs.

164
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,990
And be ready this afternoon in case they have any questions.

165
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,990
Okay?

166
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:47,990
Okay.

167
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,890
- Start smoking again? - Did you not get

168
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:53,990
my texts last night?

169
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,990
I sent you exactly 13 of them.

170
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:57,160
Yeah, I'm sorry.

171
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:57,990
I couldn't make it.

172
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:02,970
You promised me that you were

173
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:03,840
gonna try this time.

174
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:20,460
Stop thinking about something else

175
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,990
when I'm talking to you.

176
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:24,330
I hate when you do that.

177
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,990
Sorry. I was thinking about work.

178
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,990
Maybe that's why Gideon oves you so much.

179
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,990
He thanks me all the time for bringing you in.

180
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,990
But for some reason,

181
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,990
I think you secretly hate it here.

182
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,810
She was right.

183
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:37,840
I liked most of the people,

184
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,990
but our business, a cyber security firm

185
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:40,990
that protects corporations--

186
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:43,990
I can't think of anything I hate more.

187
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:44,990
No, I love it here.

188
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,990
I'm sorry.

189
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:55,990
I'm just in a bad mood.

190
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,530
I'm late on my last

191
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,990
two student loan payments,

192
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,990
and I can't get Gideon to give me a raise.

193
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:05,990
Yo, buddy.

194
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,920
Missed you last night.

195
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,320
Where were you?

196
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:08,720
Gotta go.

197
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,990
Big meeting today.

198
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,990
Did you find out what happened?

199
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,990
Yeah. He said he was working.

200
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:18,210
Oh, come on.

201
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:18,990
You gotta talk to him.

202
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:19,990
We're gonna be late for the staff meeting.

203
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:21,850
He can't stand me.

204
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,410
And you know why.

205
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,990
Angela, I can't have

206
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,360
that kind of negativity in my life.

207
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:30,990
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

208
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:42,990
What are you thinking about?

209
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:46,730
Nothing.

210
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,990
You want to know what I'm thinking about?

211
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:53,990
First time you came to me.

212
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,990
I didn't exactly come to Krista.

213
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,440
I was forced here.

214
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,330
But I do like her.

215
00:10:58,330 --> 00:10:59,990
Hacking her was simple.

216
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:01,990
Her password: Dylan 2791.

217
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,940
Favorite artist and the year in

218
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,990
which she was born, backwards.

219
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:06,990
Though she's a psychologist,

220
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:08,770
she's really bad

221
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:09,490
at reading people.

222
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:10,990
But I'm good at reading people.

223
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,280
I look for

224
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,920
the worst in them.

225
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:16,780
I know she went through

226
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,990
a divorce four years ago.

227
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:19,490
I know she was devastated by it

228
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:20,620
and has been dating losers

229
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,990
on eHarmony ever since.

230
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,410
Her most recent foray--

231
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,990
Michael Hansen.

232
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,220
I searched for him online,but nothing came up.

233
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,990
No LinkedIn, no Facebook,nothing.

234
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:34,990
Something about him bugs me,

235
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,990
scratching that part  of my mind again.

236
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:39,340
But I'll hack him soon enough.I always do.

237
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,600
I know you're not yelling like before,

238
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,720
which is good.

239
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,240
But I can tell you're still holding on to it.

240
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,680
And we need to work on your anger issues, Elliot.

241
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,220
You're angry at everyone, at society...

242
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,800
Fuck society.

243
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,700
I know you have a lot to be angry about,

244
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,620
but keeping it to yourself and staying quiet

245
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:00,320
like you're doing--it's not going to help you.

246
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,040
There's pain underneath.

247
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,740
That's where our work needs to go.

248
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:12,680
What is it about society that disappoints you so much?

249
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,460
Oh, I don't know.

250
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:23,420
Is it that we collectively thought Steve Jobs

251
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,560
was a great man, even when we knew

252
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,670
he made billions off the backs of children?

253
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:33,580
Or maybe it's that it feels like all our heroesare counterfeit.

254
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:38,040
The world itself's just one big hoax.

255
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:41,740
Spamming with our running commentary of bullshit

256
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:46,700
masquerading as insight, our social media faking as intimacy.

257
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:51,020
Or is it that we voted for this?

258
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:53,620
Not with our rigged elections,but with our things,

259
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:55,740
our property, our money.

260
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:56,980
I'm not saying anything new.

261
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:58,720
We all know why we do this,

262
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,340
not because Hunger Games books makes us happy

263
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,640
but because we wanna be sedated.

264
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,680
Because it's painful not to pretend,

265
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,000
because we're cowards.

266
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,380
Fuck society.

267
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,960
Elliot. Elliot.

268
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
You're not saying anything.

269
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,840
What's wrong?

270
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,160
Nothing.

271
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,990
Don't be frustrated.

272
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,990
Why shouldn't I be?

273
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:32,000
You're different than most.

274
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,780
You at least try.

275
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,160
You at least understand.

276
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,880
Understand what?

277
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,160
What it's like to feel alone.

278
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,940
You understand the pain.

279
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:51,360
You want to protect people from it.

280
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,100
You want to protect me from it.

281
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:58,880
I respect that about you.

282
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:06,140
Why do you think I know what it's like to feel alone?

283
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,240
Shit! From her emails!

284
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,580
Elliot?

285
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,380
I don't know.

286
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,640
Let's talk about last night.

287
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,990
Did you go to Angela's birthday party?

288
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,940
Yeah. It was nice.

289
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:29,660
Did you try to talk to anyone?

290
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,340
Sure.

291
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,860
I got a girl's number.

292
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:35,540
You did?

293
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,700
She's cute.

294
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:40,990
She likes The Hunger Games.

295
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:47,240
You're hiding again, Elliot.

296
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:51,900
When you hide, your delusions come back.

297
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:54,700
It's a slippery slope.

298
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,990
Let's talk about the men in black you've been seeing.

299
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,240
Are they still there?

300
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:07,020
No, I... told you they're gone.

301
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,100
The meds you gave me are working.

302
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,620
Yo, man.

303
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,260
Do you wanna, uh...

304
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,380
you wanna do lunch today?

305
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,700
Uh, yeah...

306
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,160
-I got other plans.-Other plans. Right.

307
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:28,220
That's...what you said the last three times I asked you.

308
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,360
Look, bud, you...

309
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,620
and Angela have been close

310
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:38,680
for a long time, and that's even more reason why I want us to be on good terms.

311
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:42,180
I-I just--I feel like things have been awkward between us.

312
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,660
Don't you?

313
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,800
I'm okay with it being awkward between us.

314
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,980
Um, yeah.

315
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,220
I-I'm--I'm not okay with that.

316
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,000
Um...look, man, I love Angela,

317
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:58,740
and I want us to-- to get along for her sake.

318
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,400
I mean, that's what I'm-- that's what I'm here for.

319
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,980
I just, I... I don't normally do stuff...

320
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:06,620
Am I crazy not to like this guy?

321
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,260
Among some of his Facebook likes

322
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,260
are George W. Bush's Decision Points,

323
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,460
Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen,

324
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:15,120
and the music of Josh Groban.

325
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:17,880
Must I really justify myself any further?

326
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,990
I'm working on that shit, you know?

327
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:25,990
His was the easiest to hack. Password was 123456Seven.

328
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:28,990
I witnessed his first "I love you" With Angela over Gchat,

329
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,320
then I witnessed the first of many infidelities with Stella B.

330
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:38,260
I've never done anything like this before...I've thought about telling Angela,

331
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,580
but she has shitty taste in men,

332
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:42,460
and I'm not quite ready to see what comes after this just yet.

333
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,480
You like music. I like music.

334
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,740
Maroon 5.

335
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:48,480
Plus I can manage Ollie easier than the others.

336
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,820
for now, anyway.

337
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,480
And that's all I mean.

338
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,180
I just want you to know that.

339
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,700
I like you, bro, and...

340
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,990
I want you to like me too.

341
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,140
I understand.

342
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,990
I'll try harder.

343
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:03,780
That's cool, man.

344
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:07,500
Hey, whenever you're ready, I'd love to just...

345
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,990
chill.

346
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:16,990
Oh--forgot about your... no touching thing.

347
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,940
Truth is, I shouldn't hate Ollie; he's not that bad a guy.

348
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,990
He's too dumb to be bad.

349
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
In fact, when I think about the really bad people...

350
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:35,320
E Corp, the largest conglomerate in the world...

351
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:36,200
they're so big,

352
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,620
they're literally everywhere.

353
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:42,440
A perfect monster of modern society.

354
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:47,520
-The E might as well stand for Evil. -And all of life's necessities...

355
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,000
In fact, after a thorough,intensive self-reprogramming,

356
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,800
that's all my mind hears, sees, or reads

357
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,540
-when they pop up in my world. -That was have to offer.

358
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,480
Together, we can change the world,

359
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,560
with E-- Evil Corp.

360
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,500
Krista would have a shit fit if she knew I did that.

361
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:06,360
But that's what they are-- a conglomerate of evil.

362
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,920
And now I have to help them.

363
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,500
There are six on-site engineers on your account.

364
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,660
- Plus a few off-site...- There he is, Terry Colby,the CTO.

365
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:18,260
Even though he's the head technology guy at one of the biggest companies in the world,

366
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,940
he owns a Blackberry.

367
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:22,660
So this is it right here.

368
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,990
But also looks like he doesn't see a terminal very often

369
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:28,340
He's not a techie. He's a moron.

370
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,780
An arrogant moron.

371
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,340
The worst kind.

372
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,540
Oh, hi. Tyrell Wellick.

373
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:42,990
I'm Senior Vice President, Technology.

374
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:47,220
Elliot. Just a tech.

375
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:49,240
Don't be so humble.

376
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,000
You know, I started out exactly where you are,

377
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,620
and...to be honest, you know,my heart is still there.

378
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,000
So I see you're running Gnome.

379
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,340
You know, I'm actually on KDE myself.

380
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:04,500
I know this desktop environment is supposed to be better but...

381
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,680
you know what they say.

382
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,860
Old habits-- they die hard.

383
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,990
An executive running Linux with--

384
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:12,740
Yeah, I know what you're thinking.

385
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,320
I'm an executive. I mean...

386
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:17,260
why am I even running Linux?

387
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:19,990
Again--old habits.

388
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,000
It's gonna be fun working with you.

389
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:28,500
I should join the rest of the group.

390
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,660
Bonsoir, Elliot.

391
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,990
Sometimes I dream of saving the world.

392
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:46,540
Saving everyone from the invisible hand,

393
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:49,990
one that brands us with an employee badge.

394
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:56,000
The one that forces us to work for them...

395
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:01,260
The one that controls us every day without us knowing it.

396
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,500
But I can't stop it.

397
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,280
I'm not that special.

398
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,340
I'm just anonymous.

399
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,550
I'm just alone.

400
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,060
If it weren't for Qwerty,

401
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,990
I'd be completely empty.

402
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:30,740
I hate when I can't hold in my loneliness.

403
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,960
This crying has been happening too often,

404
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,990
every other week now.

405
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,990
What do normal people do when they get this sad?

406
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:46,990
They reach out to friends or family, I think.

407
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:52,990
That's not an option.

408
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,340
I do morphine.

409
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:00,920
The key to doing morphine without turning into a junkie

410
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:04,440
is to limit yourself to 30 milligrams a day.

411
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,860
Anything more just builds up your tolerance.

412
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:11,380
I check every pill I get for purity.

413
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,760
I have 8 milligram Suboxone for maintenance

414
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,540
in case I go through withdrawals.

415
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:19,990
Shit! I'm out again.

416
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:23,500
How much?

417
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:26,210
On the house.

418
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:28,510
No, Shayla.

419
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:29,830
Not doing that.

420
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:31,030
Okay? This is just

421
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:32,360
a regular drug deal

422
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:33,490
like it always is.

423
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:34,710
Fine.

424
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,140
So what are you up to tonight?

425
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:36,950
'Cause I tried to post

426
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:38,060
something on your Facebook

427
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,490
and couldn't find you.

428
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,120
I'm not on Facebook.

429
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:42,860
What? Why not?

430
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,150
'Cause I hate Facebook.

431
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:49,460
That's crazy.

432
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,970
Well...you want to

433
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:54,360
do these together then?

434
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,780
Pure Molly...

435
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:13,250
Don't ever make decisions when you're on morphine.

436
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:25,570
Instagram check-in

437
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:27,410
for Krista at Pierre Loti.

438
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,150
Okay, Michael Hansen.

439
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,020
Time to find out who you really are.

440
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:20,370
Thank you. Bye.

441
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:24,900
Taxi!

442
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:32,170
Uh, hi--I just left

443
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,530
my keys in one of your cabs.

444
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:36,460
56Y2.

445
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,620
Sure.

446
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:44,070
What about you two?

447
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,150
You guys got any

448
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:47,490
spare change?

449
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,850
Help me out?

450
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,330
New York's expensive, guys.

451
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,270
Come on.

452
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:55,030
306 Hawthorne.

453
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,990
Thank you.Thank you.

454
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,950
Come on, asshole

455
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,010
Piss already.

456
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,210
Come on!

457
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:22,780
Come on!

458
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:23,890
Will you--will you go?

459
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:26,710
Come on, go, go! Go, will ya?

460
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:27,710
Hey.

461
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,340
May I borrow your phone?

462
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:34,120
Mine's dead.

463
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,050
I need to call my mom.

464
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,770
Thank you.

465
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:05,350
No answer.

466
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:06,790
Thanks anyway.

467
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:25,290
Angela,is everything okay?

468
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:27,450
I need you to come to AllSafe.

469
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,260
You're there?

470
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:30,250
It's 3:00 in the morning.

471
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:31,550
They attacked Evil Corp

472
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:32,380
servers again,

473
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:33,320
but it's bad this time.

474
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,080
It's a DDoS attack.

475
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:36,850
Did you call Lloyd? He's on call.

476
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:38,260
Yeah, he's here.

477
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:40,270
Is he talking to their tech department?

478
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,400
He's online with them,

479
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,480
but so far nothing.

480
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,550
I don't think that

481
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:46,870
Lloyd can handle this.

482
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,040
Look, Gideon just put me on this account.

483
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:51,010
I can't screw up

484
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:51,740
in my first week.

485
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,710
I need you.

486
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:54,150
Please.

487
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,950
I'll be right there.

488
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:09,700
Finally!

489
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,340
Calm down it's only been an hour.

490
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:15,990
Yeah, well, an hour in Evil Corp time is like $13 million in revenue, approximately.

491
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:16,860
Actually,

492
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:17,800
I calculated that.

493
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,850
That's exactly how much they lost.

494
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:20,980
Don't worry.

495
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:22,410
I got you.

496
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,200
Lloyd, what's up?

497
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:25,930
Lloyd!

498
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:29,410
Elliot. This is bad.

499
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,010
Worst DDoS attack I've ever seen.

500
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,740
Did you reconfigure the DNS?

501
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:33,890
Yes!

502
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:34,860
Stop the services.

503
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:36,990
I already stopped the services, tries to reboot the servers

504
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:38,480
but they're not coming back up.

505
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,990
Dude, someone is straight up fingerblasting their entire network right now.

506
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:01,430
They just started reporting on the outage.

507
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:10,450
Shit. This is worse than I thought.

508
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,770
They're in the network?

509
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,050
What's the status update?

510
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:16,110
I thought we set up security protocols

511
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:18,650
so that this doesn't happen.

512
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:20,750
Where's the attack coming from?

513
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:21,950
Everywhere, obviously.

514
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,510
The USA, Finland, Thailand, Kuwait--

515
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:27,390
Start restarting the services, load sharing, redirect the traffic. Call Prolexic for help.

516
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:29,040
What?

517
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:31,520
I don't think this is just a DDoS attack.

518
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:36,560
I think they got a rootkit sitting inside the servers.

519
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,870
What's a rootkit?

520
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,800
It's like a crazy serial rapist with a very big dick.

521
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,350
Jesus, Lloyd.

522
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:45,250
Sorry. It's malicious code that completely takes over their system.

523
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,230
It can delete system files

524
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:48,330
and stop programs.

525
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:49,540
Viruses, worms

526
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,500
How do we stop it?

527
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,310
That's the thing.

528
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:53,360
It's fundamentally invisible you can't stop it.

529
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,720
All of their servers are timing out.

530
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,200
None of them are coming back up.

531
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:59,380
That's because every time we restart the server the virus replicates itself

532
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:01,990
during boot up and crashes the host.

533
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:05,990
How are we supposed to bring up the network if we can't restart the servers?

534
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,450
We can't.

535
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:10,410
Which is what they wanted.

536
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:14,990
By defending ourselves, we ended up spreading the virus everywhere.

537
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:18,990
Only thing we can do is we've gotta take the whole system offline

538
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:22,990
wipe the infected servers, clean, then bring them back up.

539
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,250
You're coming with me.

540
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:26,980
Yeah.

541
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:27,000
Lloyd.
Yeah.

542
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,030
Lloyd.

543
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,670
Tell everybody to start taking everything offline.

544
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:31,030
On it.

545
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:34,820
Uh, the server farm in Dulles. We're gonna need the jet.

546
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,990
They're booting the network back up.

547
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,030
Now, you're downloading the logs, right--

548
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,420
Stop. Tell him to stop.

549
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:54,840
What?

550
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:56,230
Don't start the boot sequence.

551
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,290
You guys missed one.

552
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:00,010
There's an infected server up and running.

553
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:03,510
What's the ETA before it hits this server?

554
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,470
The backup server up and running?

555
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:13,460
It's ready, but it's not configured for auto switch.

556
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:21,420
We need to redirect the traffic, need to switch DNS.

557
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:28,430
you got this. You got this, you got this,

558
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,910
This is impossible.

559
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:33,200
you got this, you got this. You got this,

560
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,260
It's almost at the back server!

561
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,500
We still up?

562
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:56,010
We're okay.

563
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,200
Yeah.

564
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:07,860
Hank.

565
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:11,390
I'm gonna take a look at the infected server, okay?  Give me a minute

566
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,710
Yeah. Uh...I'll meet you at the elevators.

567
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,830
They must have left a mark or something.

568
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:24,800
Every hacker loves attention.

569
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:27,230
They don't just do DDoS attacks for no reason.

570
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:35,080
This is it.

571
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:36,600
Fsociety.

572
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,690
Is that supposed to be a joke?

573
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:42,050
This was way too easy. They didn't hide it well at all.

574
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:51,760
This note is for me.

575
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:55,590
They're telling me to leave it here.

576
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:59,000
But why? Doesn't matter.

577
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,950
Time to shut them down.

578
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,430
Why can't I delete it?

579
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,310
I don't want to delete it. I want it to stay.

580
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:10,630
What's wrong with me?

581
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:19,930
I'll reconfigure the access to the root directory so only I can use it.

582
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:24,960
And no one will know.

583
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,290
For you, sir.

584
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:37,650
Did you know that I'm gay?

585
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,480
No.

586
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:52,690
Consider this me coming out to you then, okay?

587
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:56,030
It's hard because I don't like to talk about my sex life.

588
00:31:56,030 --> 00:32:00,000
But my partner, he gets very paranoid.

589
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,820
He thinks I'm ashamed of

590
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,580
He wants me to be more public about it, so

591
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:08,770
Anyway, I'm gay.

592
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:13,250
Thanks.

593
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,970
Yeah.

594
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,180
Hey, man, don't worry about it.

595
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:27,990
Hackers have a short attention span. They'll get bored, harass someone else.

596
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:31,990
Evil Corp is thinking about leaving us.

597
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:36,130
And I don't know if I can blame them.

598
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:41,680
They could have called their other security teams.

599
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:43,650
They called you.

600
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:47,260
Well, somebody over there likes us

601
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,800
but Terry Colby, he's getting the pressure.

602
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:52,910
and he calls the shots.

603
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:56,770
Evil Corp is 80% of our business.

604
00:32:57,110 --> 00:33:01,990
If we lose them, it's gonna be it for us.It's gonna be it...

605
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:04,990
For me.

606
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:15,660
NI feel like I can talk to you.

607
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,900
I mean, more than the others, anyway.

608
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:24,990
I'm sure, in a weird way, you'll be happy if we went under.

609
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:27,920
Oh, come on.

610
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:32,250
I know you hate wearing those stupid shirts.

611
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,970
Gideon?

612
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,160
I promise I'll find them.

613
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,870
Evil Corp service should be back up soon enough.

614
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,400
I'll take a look at the dat file.

615
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:09,380
I'll ask my IRC contacts about fsociety when I get home.

616
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:11,740
I've never seen their name on the boards though.

617
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:14,000
They've gotta be new, but they're good.

618
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:22,560
Rough night?

619
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,270
I'm getting off here.

620
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,880
I think you should come with me.

621
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,080
But only if you didn't delete it.

622
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:39,520
You deleted it, we got nothing to talk about.

623
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:42,840
Are you talking to me?

624
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:49,250
Stand clear of the closing doors, please.

625
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:04,430
Who are you?

626
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:07,910
We gotta wait for the Q.

627
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,300
Then what?

628
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,260
Then we're going to Brooklyn.

629
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:21,040
Out by Coney Island.

630
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:26,600
Why? What's there?

631
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:32,340
Obviously you're gonna ask a lot of questions.

632
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:36,240
It's weird what you're doing right now, I get it.

633
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:41,880
I-I can't tell you anything until we get there.

634
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:51,100
Can't smoke in here.

635
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:58,080
You've been following me.

636
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:01,100
Why?

637
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,200
What do you want from me?

638
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:12,640
My dad was a petty thief.

639
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:16,140
Never could hold down a job. So, he just robbed,

640
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:19,990
convenience stores,shops,small-time stuff.

641
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:23,900
One time,he sat me down,he told me something I never forgot.

642
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:26,700
He said, "Everyone steals.

643
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,700
"That's how it works.

644
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:32,280
"You think people out there are getting exactly What they deserve? No.

645
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:36,440
"They're getting paid over or under,

646
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,780
but someone in the chain always gets bamboozled.

647
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:44,240
"I steal, Son,but I don't get caught."

648
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:47,380
"That's my contract with society.

649
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:50,500
"Now if you can catch me stealing, I'll go to jail.

650
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,260
"But if you can't,

651
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:56,160
then I've earned the money."

652
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:01,220
I respected that, man.

653
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:07,580
I thought that shit was cool as a little kid.

654
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,640
A few years after that,

655
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:12,660
they finally caught him.
A few years after that,

656
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:15,080
they finally caught him.

657
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:19,640
Sent him to jail. Dies five years later.

658
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:22,760
My respect goes with him.

659
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:27,080
I thought he was free doing what he did,

660
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,100
but he wasn't.

661
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:33,100
He was in prison.

662
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:37,720
Just like you are now,Elliot.

663
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:43,600
But I'm gonna break you out.

664
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,640
Why would you guys actually meet IRL?

665
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,780
You remember that hacker group O-Megz?

666
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:47,720
They got outed by their own leader to the FBI,and six hackers went to prison for it?

667
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,100
You know how they got 'em?

668
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,500
They went on the dude's computer,

669
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:54,180
tracked 'em all down through emails,VPN sessions,

670
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:56,160
chat messages, texts.

671
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:00,010
- One guy, and the whole thing comes down. It's what's called - A central point of failure.

672
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:03,860
Right Because they refused to meet in person,

673
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:07,300
they compromised each other every time they sent so much as a smiley face.

674
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,720
The rule here is,

675
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:10,760
it's done here,

676
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,120
and only here.

677
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:17,990
It ends when you walk out that door,and begins when you walk in.

678
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:21,560
Our encryption is the real world.

679
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,680
How do you talk to each other then?

680
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,960
We don't.

681
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,960
We come and go, work on the project when we can.

682
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,920
How do you trust them?

683
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,920
I give them an exercise.

684
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:37,080
If they pass, they join us. If they fail

685
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:40,020
The DDoS attack last night,

686
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:43,520
you were testing me.

687
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:51,560
You said there was a project.

688
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:55,060
-What's the project? -That'll come later.

689
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:58,840
I just wanted you to see the place.

690
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:07,980
There's not much you can do without a CPU.

691
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:12,820
I'm crazy.

692
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:15,940
I have to be crazy because that didn't just happen, right?

693
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:17,800
This is a delusion. Is this a delusion?

694
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:21,160
Shit, I'm a schizo.

695
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,520
Have I really lost it this time?

696
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,760
No, no. Last night happened. It was real.

697
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,140
Angela called me. I was at AllSafe.

698
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:29,140
Evil Corp's servers were compromised.

699
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,500
Those are facts,not delusions

700
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:35,140
I know. I know, I know I realize I'm saying all of this to an imaginary person,

701
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:36,980
but I created you.

702
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,940
I didn't create this.

703
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:41,560
Oh, thank God you're here.

704
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:44,860
I was just about to go wait in the Starbucks.

705
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:47,720
You live in a bad neighborhood. Do you know that?

706
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,700
I do know that.

707
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:54,990
Do you want to get high and watch your favorite movie?

708
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:56,900
Oh, you saved our asses last night

709
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:00,060
I thought Gideon was definitely gonna fire me.

710
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:01,600
Where have you been?

711
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,100
I thought you'd be sleeping.

712
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:08,440
I--yeah, I fell asleep on the train.

713
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:12,200
That sounds like such a lie,

714
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:16,420
but, whatever. I don't want to get into that right now.

715
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:19,800
So you want to do this?

716
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,360
I miss Qwerty.

717
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,780
I hope she still loves me.

718
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,380
Shit.

719
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:38,860
She wasn't supposed to be here, okay?

720
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,160
Give me a minute and I'll get rid of her.

721
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:44,260
That's okay. Um...

722
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:46,980
This is great.

723
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,900
-Elliot, I'm happy for you. -No, it's not like that.

724
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:52,300
Well, maybe it should be,you know?

725
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:56,680
It's good that you're...dating.

726
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,880
Well, I'll see you on Monday.

727
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,280
We can do movie night next time.

728
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:08,000
I promise, okay?

729
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,540
Yeah.

730
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,460
Have fun.

731
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,840
Mm, Elliot?

732
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:39,080
Oh, shit. Is it Wednesday?

733
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:42,260
-Shayla. -I have to move my car.

734
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:45,600
Shayla, leave.

735
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:49,920
Now.

736
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,100
No mention of Mr. Robot anywhere.

737
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:56,920
No mention of F-society.

738
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,840
Not on any of the hacker boards.

739
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:01,160
Not on IRC, forums, blogs,

740
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,660
no one's heard of them.

741
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:09,860
Property was owned by Fun Society Amusement, LLC for 13 years.

742
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:13,120
Owner was shot a killed a year and a half ago.

743
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,900
No owner since.

744
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:18,700
And the ownership history before that is sparse to nonexistent.

745
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:22,460
This guy is good. Very good.

746
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,740
Doesn't matter.

747
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:34,000
Their arcade network's IP is in the dat file

748
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:38,260
That'll be enough to turn them in.

749
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:55,460
What's your ask, Mr. Robot?

750
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:06,960
Hey, man,

751
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:10,400
where's your boss?

752
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:12,360
Okay, cut the bullshit.

753
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:16,540
When are you going to give us access to the root directory?

754
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:17,720
What?

755
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:20,900
Dude, come on. I wrote that rootkit.

756
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:24,760
I still have to put Colby's IP in the dat file.

757
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,860
Dickhead.

758
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:36,520
Elliot! Good news.

759
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,800
I scored the last bag of Twinkies from Gristedes.

760
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,700
You want one?

761
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:42,600
She just called me a dickhead.

762
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:45,040
Yeah, that's Darlene.

763
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:49,520
Hey, you like Ferris wheels?

764
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:54,840
Ah, it's beautiful.

765
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:58,180
Gets better the higher up you go, you know?

766
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,720
Oh, I love it up here.

767
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:04,180
You like it?

768
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:07,960
I'm here to tell you I'm turning you in.

769
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:12,740
I'm giving them all the information.  -Let me tell you why you're really here.

770
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:16,840
You're here because you sense something wrong with the world.

771
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:19,780
Something you can't explain.

772
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:24,340
But you know it controls you and everyone you care about.

773
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:26,960
What are you talking about?

774
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:31,640
Money.

775
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:36,680
Money hasn't been real since we got off the gold standard. It's become virtual.

776
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,060
Software.

777
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:41,380
The operating system of our world.

778
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,540
And, Elliot, we are on the verge

779
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:48,440
of taking down this virtual reality.

780
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:50,880
Think about it.

781
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:56,240
What if you could take down one conglomerate?

782
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:01,640
A conglomerate so deeply entrenched in the world's economy,

783
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:05,240
that too big to fail doesn't even come close to describing it.

784
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:08,320
You want to create another financial meltdown

785
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:11,140
like the one we just had,but way worse.

786
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:13,180
Yeah, why would I want that?

787
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:14,860
Everyone would lose their money.

788
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:21,220
What if I told you that this conglomerate just so happens to own 70% of the global consumer credit industry?

789
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:23,020
If we hit their data center just right,

790
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:25,660
we could systematically format all the servers

791
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:29,660
-including backup. -That would erase all

792
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:30,660
All the debt we owe them.

793
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:34,980
Every record of every credit card, loan, and mortgage would be wiped clean.

794
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:38,220
It would be impossible to reinforce outdated paper records.

795
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,920
It would all be gone.

796
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:47,540
The single biggest incident of wealth redistribution in history.

797
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:56,940
Evil Corp. The conglomerate.

798
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:59,540
That's why you picked me.

799
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:01,940
Because I work at AllSafe.

800
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:05,990
Tomorrow, AllSafe is going to get a visit from the FBI

801
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:08,400
and the U.S. Cyber Command.

802
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:12,400
You are going to modify the dat file

803
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:17,620
and put Colby's terminal IP address in there.

804
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:19,980
Terry Colby?

805
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:21,580
You're gonna frame him?

806
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:23,100
No one's gonna believe that.

807
00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:26,240
I met him, he's a moron.

808
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:28,200
So are the FBI.

809
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,180
Even if they don't believe he did it,

810
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:33,360
they'll believehe gave someone access to it.

811
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,160
Yeah, he'll just go to jail.

812
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:36,500
What good will that do?

813
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:39,960
You don't take down a conglomerate by shooting them in the heart.

814
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,560
That's the thing about conglomerates,

815
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:43,620
they don't have hearts.

816
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:45,990
You take them down limb by limb.

817
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:47,820
And as they unravel,

818
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:51,240
their illusion of control unravels.

819
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:59,300
Who are you?

820
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,860
That'll come later.

821
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:06,400
Right now, you have a lot to think about.

822
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,600
You have to change the dat file

823
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:11,990
and put Colby's IP in there.

824
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:16,920
You do that,

825
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:22,780
you have set in motion the largest revolution the world will ever see.

826
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:32,340
Neil Diamond's ?

827
00:48:35,990 --> 00:48:39,060
If you go away ?

828
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,490
On this summer day ?

829
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:45,480
Then you might as well ?

830
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:47,640
take the sun away ?

831
00:48:49,150 --> 00:48:51,230
All the birds that flew ?

832
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:53,560
In a summer sky ?

833
00:48:55,110 --> 00:48:56,690
When our love was new ?

834
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,280
And our hearts were high ?

835
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,050
When the day was young ?

836
00:49:02,490 --> 00:49:03,960
And the night was long ?

837
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,160
And the moon stood still ?

838
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:09,760
For the night birds song ?

839
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,200
If you go away ?

840
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:15,560
If you go away ?

841
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,450
If you go away ?

842
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,590
But if you stay ?

843
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:26,910
I'll make you a day ?

844
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:29,260
Like no day's been ?

845
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:32,040
Or will be again ?

846
00:49:32,810 --> 00:49:34,700
We'll sail on the sun ?

847
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:38,310
We'll ride on the rain ?

848
00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:40,330
We'll talk to the trees ?

849
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:43,820
And worship the wind ?

850
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:46,690
Then if you go ?

851
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,780
I'll understand ?

852
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,660
Leave me just enough love ?

853
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:55,510
To fill up my hand ?

854
00:49:55,650 --> 00:49:58,350
If you go away ?

855
00:49:59,070 --> 00:50:01,170
If you go away ?

856
00:50:02,490 --> 00:50:04,850
If you go away ?

857
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,530
If you go away ?

858
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:14,040
As I know you must ?

859
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:17,590
There'll be nothing left ?

860
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:20,250
In the world to trust ?

861
00:50:21,930 --> 00:50:23,560
Just an empty room ?

862
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,970
Full of empty space ?

863
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:29,310
Like the empty look ?

864
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:32,410
I see on your face ?

865
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,280
Can I tell you now ?

866
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:38,040
As you turn to go ?

867
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:41,380
I'll be dying slowly ?

868
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:44,360
Till your next hello ?

869
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:47,410
If you go away ?

870
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:50,760
If you go away ?

871
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:55,410
If you go away... ?

872
00:50:55,550 --> 00:50:58,660
So, what do we got?

873
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:03,300
So, if you'll take a look at the first page of your agenda--

874
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:05,990
You're the one who stopped the hack.

875
00:51:05,990 --> 00:51:09,520
You know, the gals in analysis said this was a tough one.

876
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:10,990
All things being equal,

877
00:51:10,990 --> 00:51:13,540
it should have shut us down for days, so...

878
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:15,400
you did good.

879
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:18,100
Okay.

880
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:22,800
We should start with our account executive, Angela.

881
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,880
Okay, we first noticed the breach

882
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:28,300
2:07 A.M. Eastern Standard on Friday night.

883
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:30,990
You mean, Saturday?

884
00:51:30,990 --> 00:51:34,460
Sorry, yes, technically, Saturday morning.

885
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:36,280
Yeah, okay, Angela,

886
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:39,860
that's what we're here for. The technicals.

887
00:51:39,990 --> 00:51:41,990
Right.

888
00:51:41,990 --> 00:51:43,800
Yes.

889
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:46,990
Anyway, he arrived at the office35 and I instru--

890
00:51:46,990 --> 00:51:47,770
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

891
00:51:47,770 --> 00:51:50,740
So that's almost a half hour after the initial breach.

892
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:52,580
Why didn't anyone pipe in from their laptops?

893
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:54,900
- It's not protocol - It wouldn't have been secure

894
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:58,300
if someone terminaled in on this.

895
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:02,320
It was the smarter move to have someone come in

896
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,960
-so they can log in on a secure line. -Exactly.

897
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:08,990
Then Lloyd was able to -Just--just actually, just one second.

898
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,440
- Yeah.

899
00:52:21,990 --> 00:52:23,990
You know, I, uh,

900
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:27,260
I always loved this view.

901
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:45,720
Now that that's taken care of,

902
00:52:45,770 --> 00:52:47,990
let's pick it up where we left off.

903
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:49,990
What happened to Angela?

904
00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:50,990
She knows more about what happened.

905
00:52:50,990 --> 00:52:53,990
She's not going to work out for us, not on this level.

906
00:52:53,990 --> 00:52:57,240
We need to stick to the more tech savvy here.

907
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:01,840
Now, let's get to the heart of this thing

908
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:07,040
because I can't sit hereand look through a packet for the next 20 minutes.

909
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:10,100
All right, just who did this?

910
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:11,990
Is it that hard?

911
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:14,940
Who did this?

912
00:53:15,990 --> 00:53:21,600
I found the configuration file of the rootkit with a pattern of IP addresses.

913
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:28,840
Once you decrypt it, you'll know where the hack came from

914
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:41,860
19 days.

915
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:49,020
No news, no arrests,no revolution

916
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:05,780
No FBI, Colby, Evil Corp.

917
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:22,160
No Mr. Robot.

918
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:24,460
No fsociety.

919
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:36,480
I need to take my mind off things.

920
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:46,820
Hello.

921
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:50,680
Hi, this is Sam from Bank of E security fraud department

922
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:54,840
Unfortunately I have to inform you N that your account's been compromised.

923
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:56,780
What? What happened?

924
00:54:56,780 --> 00:55:00,320
First before I can answer any questions I need to verify some information

925
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,920
Are you still at 306 Hawthorne Avenue?

926
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:04,660
Yes. Apartment 2C.

927
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:08,400
Great. And your security question,favorite baseball team?

928
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,360
Um, Yankees.

929
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:14,060
-I don't remember this being a security question. -And lastly, your pet's name?

930
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:15,880
Um, Flipper.

931
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:19,500
Who am I speaking to?Can I get your name and number?

932
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:28,120
With those details plus Na dictionary brute-force attack,it'll take my program maybe two minutes to crack his password.

933
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,820
What I wouldn't give to be normal.

934
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:39,620
To live in that bubble,

935
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:43,990
the reality of the naive.

936
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:50,040
That's how I justify this.

937
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:54,120
To keep their optimism intact.

938
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:56,800
To protect them.

939
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:03,420
How? He's too old to have a complicated password

940
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:06,990
It had to have been a combination of these things.

941
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:12,920
I'm missing something,I'm missing something,I'm missing something.

942
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:18,280
Michael Hansen N isn't his real name.

943
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,920
Lenny Shannon?

944
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:35,500
Michael Hansen?

945
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:39,140
Which one are you playing tonight?

946
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:41,500
You're going to stops eeing Krista.

947
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:42,680
What the fuck...

948
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:46,340
You're going to break up with her.You're never going to see her again.

949
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:49,020
You're the guy that used my phone

950
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:51,900
You cheated on your current wife with seven different women.

951
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:53,960
I got digital proof of all of it.

952
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:57,480
Ashley Madison, online escorts,fake Facebook pages

953
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:59,380
I own it all.

954
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:01,460
And if you don't stop seeing her,

955
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:05,800
your wife will know everything along with the police.

956
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:06,920
The police?

957
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:09,900
Yeah, one of the escorts was 15.

958
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:14,840
That 15 part I made up,

959
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:18,200
but he did have a proclivity for young escorts that helped the lie.

960
00:57:18,290 --> 00:57:19,600
But I'm not gonna do any of that

961
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:22,720
as long as you break up with Krista.

962
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:25,360
Tonight.

963
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:30,500
Done.

964
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:33,760
You're also gonna tell her the truth.

965
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:36,000
That you're married,cheat on your wife,

966
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,860
you hire hookers.

967
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:41,400
That you never had any intention of being serious with her.

968
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:42,640
Why?

969
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:45,840
That would destroy her. She thinks that...

970
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:47,740
We're in love.

971
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:52,260
Exactly. Krista needs to avoid dickheads like you in the future.

972
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:54,420
Her radar needs fixing.

973
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:57,120
I'll know if you skip any detail.

974
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:59,660
So don't.

975
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,380
And one more thing...

976
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:08,080
I'm gonna need something from you.

977
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:13,040
Come on.

978
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:28,660
I like you, Flipper.

979
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:30,740
You're cool.

980
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:34,800
I never want to be right about my hacks,

981
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:37,660
but people always find a way to disappoint.

982
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:47,600
Michael Hansen now gets filed away among the others.

983
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:50,990
Forever buried in my digital cemetery.

984
00:58:58,460 --> 00:59:01,220
The look of disillusionment.

985
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:03,560
He told her. She cried all night.

986
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:05,340
Now comes the sadness.

987
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:09,660
I don't like seeing her sad.

988
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:14,760
- You okay?- Sorry.

989
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:16,660
Sorry.

990
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:20,460
Go on.

991
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:26,400
I think Angela blames me for what happened at the Evil Corp meeting.

992
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,880
What do I do? I need to talk to her.

993
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:32,180
I think you just answered your own question.

994
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:33,920
Talk to her.

995
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:36,580
She won't respond to any of my texts or emails.

996
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:38,820
Then go to her in person.

997
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:41,300
Tell her you need to talk

998
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:45,000
Communication is key,Elliot.

999
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,520
Real human interaction.

1000
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:53,990
That's what's important for you right now.

1001
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:08,320
Hey. Do you-- Do you think we can talk?

1002
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:09,620
- What?

1003
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:10,780
You won't talk to me.

1004
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:12,880
You haven't talked to mes ince the meeting.

1005
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:16,400
I don't want to talk to you because I feel embarrassed

1006
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:19,420
every time I think about what happened.

1007
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:20,900
Okay?

1008
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:24,080
It's fine. I'll get over it.

1009
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:25,840
- It's been three weeks. - I have to get back to work.

1010
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:29,440
You're just going to ignore me? -You didn't have to stick up for me in there

1011
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:31,540
I know that you were just trying to help,

1012
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:34,380
just don't do it again.

1013
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:36,500
Even if I'm losing.

1014
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:39,200
Let me lose, okay?

1015
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:43,180
Don't look confused.

1016
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:45,300
Just say it.

1017
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,620
"Okay."

1018
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:53,760
Okay.

1019
01:01:08,620 --> 01:01:11,990
Elliott.

1020
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:33,320
FBI agents claim that Colby either used hacking groups or worked in conjunction with them

1021
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:37,990
to pressure Evil Corp during his contract negotiations.

1022
01:01:37,990 --> 01:01:42,040
After a long and exhaustive investigation,sources close to the FBI

1023
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:49,280
have confirmed the hacks were in part tied to Colby's terminal.

1024
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:54,060
It's happening, it's happening,it's happening, it's happening.

1025
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:06,380
it's happening, it's happening. It's happening, it's happening,

1026
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:25,460
Sir, step inside the car.

1027
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:38,940
Step insidethe vehicle now.

1028
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:10,860
Go ahead.

1029
01:03:10,860 --> 01:03:13,360
Sir, go on in.

1030
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:19,820
Sir, go on in.

1031
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:14,440
Bon soir, Elliot.

1032
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:19,800
Please tell me you're seeing this, too.
