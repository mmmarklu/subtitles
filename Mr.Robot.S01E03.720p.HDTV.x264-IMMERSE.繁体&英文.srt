沒人知道原因

他得了白血病
He had leukemia.

還逼我不可以告訴別人
Made me swear to never tell anyone,

36
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:22,980
最后  我太擔心了  就告訴了我媽
Finally, I got so worried told my mom.

你沒有遵守你們的神圣約定
You didn't commit to the sacred pact you'd formed.

41
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:48,520
我對本公司未來業務發展的規劃
My approach within our business units

42
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,680
就是優先投資研發前沿技術
is to first invest in new technologies

43
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,980
并盡早投入使用
and develop prototypes

44
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,350
以此把握科技界的最新潮流
in order to understand the technology potential,

45
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:56,440
因為盡管我公司網絡安全部門

00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,050
那么  各位先生  請允許我毛遂自薦

更向公眾展示了我們的無畏
but strength in our boldness to the public.

多謝各位撥冗

先生  非常感謝您見我
Sir, thank you again for seeing me.

78
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:35,170
提利爾  恐怕我們得重新安排了
Tyrell, I'm gonna have to reschedule this.

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,460
我明白  我明白
I get it, I get it.

81
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,800
我們馬上就再給你安排個時間
We'll get another meeting on the books right away.

82
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,480
我們找到了一個非常優秀的首席技術官人選
We've got a really good CTO candidate

83
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,950
董事會非常青睞這個人
the board is very excited about.

84
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,070
不過他們還沒定下來
They're not ready to discuss it yet.

85
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,550
我們會給你安排好的
We'll loop you in.

86
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,450
讓我們考慮幾周  可以嗎
Just give us a couple of weeks, hmm?

87
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,910
給威利克重新排個時間
Uh, put Wellick back on the books.

88
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:56,990
就等兩周
Two weeks.

89
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,620
領帶不錯啊
Oh, nice tie.

90
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,590
我猜猜
Let me guess.

91
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,120
布里奧尼的
Brioni?

92
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,550
品味總是這么好
Great taste, as always.

93
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:05,620
回見
Be well.

94
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,240
我這就把具體細節發給您的助手
I'll email your assistant the details.

95
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,020
如果不麻煩的話
If you could,

96
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:18,720
直接發給我吧
just email it to me directly.

97
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,720
這事對我太重要  不容有失
This is too important for me to miss.

98
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,610
威利克先生  我們到了
Mr. Wellick, we're here.

99
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,420
這次能給我300塊錢嗎
You think I could have 300 this time?

100
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:06,790
還真像個資本主義者
Spoken like a true capitalist.

101
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,620
工作不順嗎
Bad day at the office?

102
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,240
看來真的
No ki--

103
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:03,380
求你了  別打了  停
Please, enough. No more.

104
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,090
大多數程序員都認為軟件除漏
Most coders think debugging software

105
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:58,110
就是修正錯誤
is about fixing a mistake,

106
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,880
不過這是胡扯
but that's bullshit.

107
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,310
除漏的關鍵其實是找到錯漏
Debugging's actually all about finding the bug,

108
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:07,000
理解這個漏洞從何而來
about understanding why the bug was there to begin with,

109
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:10,870
以及明白漏洞的出現并非偶然
about knowing that its existence was no accident.

110
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:13,830
漏洞向你傳達了信息
It came to you to deliver a message,

111
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,280
就像一個毫無意識的氣泡浮出水面
like an unconscious bubble floating to the surface,

112
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:21,190
爆出你可能早就心知肚明的真相
popping with a revelation you've secretly known all along.

113
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:24,120
我不知道我為什么說這些
I don't know why I'm saying all of this.

114
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,690
也許是因為打了太多禮來制藥
Maybe it's because I'm pumped up on whatever---

115
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:30,390
用來圈錢的  不知道什么合法藥品
legal drug dealers like Eli Lilly make money off nowadays.

116
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:33,520
不過一般是因為我預見到了
But usually it's because there's a sense it's coming.

117
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,250
正有只蟲子[漏洞]朝我飛來
A bug buzzing its way towards me

118
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,590
攪得我不得安寧  逼我作出決定
to gum up the works until it forces me to make a call.

119
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:42,320
殺了我還是接受我
Kill me or embrace me.

120
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:45,120
又或者我只是有點嚇著了  因為我沒想到
Or maybe I'm just freaking out because I never thought

121
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,380
會醒來看到這兩個女人盯著我
I'd wake up to find these two women staring back at me.

122
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,730
你醒了嗎
Are you awake?

123
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,100
我說不清
I don't know.

124
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:04,680
你怎么來了
What are you doing here?

125
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:09,790
我幾個小時前剛來時  你我還說過話呢
We talked maybe a few hours ago when I first got here.

126
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,330
你忘了嗎
You don't remember?

127
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:14,090
他們說我是你的緊急聯絡人
They said I was your emergency contact.

128
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:22,180
對了  你還要他們聯系你的心理醫生
Right. Um, you told them to call your psychiatrist.

129
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,610
只有咨詢了心理醫生之后你才能出院
You can't leave until you talk to one.

130
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,250
我出去等著了
So I'm gonna wait outside.

131
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,120
你還記得你向醫務人員點名聯系我嗎
Do you remember requesting me from the staff?

132
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:44,050
你要我來是因為警察說
You requested me because the police said that--

133
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:46,790
我被幾個小青年偷襲了
I got jumped by a bunch of kids.

134
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,660
沒什么大不了的
It's not the end of the world.

135
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,740
他們要做全面的藥檢  你拒絕了
They wanted to do a full drug panel, and you refused.

136
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,120
我能問問原因嗎
May I ask why?

137
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:00,470
艾略特  如果我們都不能好好談談的話
Elliot, if we can't have a conversation about this...

138
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,660
我一直在用嗎啡
I've been taking morphine.

139
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,020
為什么
Why?

140
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:17,020
我也沒什么合理的理由給你
I don't have a good enough reason to give you.

141
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,730
我希望有  但我沒有
I wish I did, but I don't.

142
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,640
也許你應該去戒毒
Maybe we should consider rehab.

143
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,910
我不是癮君子
I'm not a junkie.

144
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,280
那你得證明給我看
Then you'll need to prove it to me.

145
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,030
每兩個月自愿參加一次藥檢
Submit to a bimonthly drug test voluntarily.

146
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:32,500
只有這樣我才會同意你出院
That's the only way that I'll recommend your release.

147
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:34,250
醫院
Hospitals.

148
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:35,820
像這樣高度聯網的機構
A heavily networked one like this

149
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,920
黑進去太輕松了
are almost too easy to hack.

150
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,990
這位是威廉·海斯密斯
This is William Highsmith.

151
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:43,230
他不止是這家醫院技術部門的頭頭
He's not only the head of the IT department here,

152
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:45,830
他還是整個部門唯一的員工
he is the IT department.

153
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,730
他還是個白癡
He's also an idiot,

154
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:50,120
但我倒不怨他  因為雇用他的人
not that I blame him because the people that hired him

155
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,800
也是一群白癡
are also idiots.

156
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,810
這可憐鬼每年只有7000塊左右的預算
The poor guy only gets a budget of about 7,000 bucks a year,

157
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,640
就憑他還想保護自家網絡
and he's supposed to protect their network

158
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,180
不被我這樣的人黑
from people like me?

159
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,240
一點機會都沒有
He never stood a chance.

160
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,860
他用Windows98系統上沒用的
He uses useless virus scans, dated servers,

161
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:07,110
病毒掃描軟件  過時服務器和安全軟件
and security software that runs on Windows 98.

162
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,080
我就是因為這一點  才指定這家醫院
It's one of the reasons why I made this place

163
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,260
為我的優先收治醫院
my primary care facility.

164
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,500
{\an8}藥品檢測  陽性

165
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:13,040
我可以把我的病歷
I can make my health records

166
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,140
改得就像那些順從的活死人一樣正常
look like every other obedient zombie out there.

167
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,240
{\an8}陰性

168
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:19,320
好
Okay.

169
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:21,330
你不用擔心
You don't have to worry.

170
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:23,540
我不會再嗑嗎啡了
I'm not gonna do morphine again.

171
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,450
你這兒有火柴嗎
Hey, you got some matches?

172
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,250
多謝
Thank you.

173
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,960
{\an8}能量飲料  無糖  低卡

174
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:46,520
你這早餐真簡單
That's a nice breakfast.

175
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,690
抱歉  信用卡刷不了
Sorry. Credit card system is down.

176
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,190
{\an8}由于邪惡公司最近的入侵事故  本店信用卡系統無法使用

177
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:53,380
如我所說
Like I said,

178
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,090
除漏最難的一點
the most difficult thing about debugging

179
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:56,860
不是修補漏洞
isn't fixing the bug.

180
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,440
{\an8}大規模黑客攻擊

181
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,090
而是找到漏洞
It's all about finding the bug.

182
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,320
對于邪惡公司
For Evil Corp,

183
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,760
機器人先生通過我找到了他們的漏洞
Mr. Robot found their bug in me.

184
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:06,300
我就是那個觸發了這一切的錯漏
I was the mistake that led to all of this.

185
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,310
有件事我得問問你
I have to ask you one thing.

186
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:11,940
維拉被抓和你有關系嗎
Did you have something to do with Vera getting busted?

187
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,340
見鬼  艾略特
Shit, Elliot.

188
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,500
你說了你不會插手的
You said you weren't gonna do anything.

189
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:20,320
他被控殺人罪了  你知道嗎
He's on murder charges, do you know that?

190
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,030
他手下的人都完蛋了
His whole crew bounced.

191
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:24,950
我現在也不知道去哪掙錢了
I mean, I don't know what I'm gonna do for money now.

192
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:27,590
告訴我吧  艾略特
Just tell me, Elliot,

193
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,180
別撒謊
and don't lie.

194
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,290
你是不是做了什么
Did you do something?

195
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,410
沒有
No.

196
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,590
你還好嗎
Are you okay?

197
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,020
發生了這么多事
I mean, with everything that happened--

198
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,160
我很好
I'm fine.

199
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:52,900
你的門怎么了
What happened to your door?

200
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,420
你不該在這里的
You're not supposed to be here, okay?

201
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,250
我換鎖是有原因的
I changed the locks for a reason.

202
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:04,330
玩具挺有意思
Interesting toy,

203
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:06,810
不過你還是得多花點心思
but you may want to spend a little more scratch

204
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:09,090
才能指望這玩意兒
if you actually want it to, you know,

205
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,300
鎖得住
work.

206
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,140
看這個
Check it.

207
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:18,430
{\an8}絕不退縮

208
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:15,750
杰西卡·阿爾芭說她想加入去社會
Jessica Alba says she wants to join fsociety.

209
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:20,060
老天  你的臉怎么了
Jesus, what happened to your face?

210
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,890
怎么回事
What's going on?

211
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:28,530
我也不算什么社交禮儀公主
Well, I am not the princess of social graces,

212
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:30,410
但一般情況下都會說
but typically it goes something like,

213
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:32,590
-"你好  這位是達琳"  -別說了
- "Hi, this is Darlene." - Stop.

214
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,780
你該走了
You need to leave.

215
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:38,290
寶貝  說真的  我們還要討論很多事
Babe, seriously, we have a lot of shit to discuss,

216
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:39,200
所以如果你不介意...
so if you wouldn't mind...

217
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,120
出去
Get out.

218
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,700
我建議你鎮靜下來
I suggest you get a grip.

219
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,860
她在說什么
What was she talking about?

220
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:03,200
我得去工作了
I got to get to work.

221
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,930
工作  你在開玩笑嗎
Work? Are you serious?

222
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:07,510
你現在不能去工作  你應該請病假
You can't go to work. You have to call in sick.

223
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:08,800
我必須得去
I have to go.

224
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:18,740
{\an8}絕不退縮

225
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:13,650
漏洞不僅僅是個錯誤
A bug is never just a mistake.

226
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,990
這說明有更大的問題
It represents something bigger.

227
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,040
思想上的紕漏
An error of thinking.

228
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:28,540
-先生  先生  先生  -這說明你是怎樣的人
- Sir! Sir! Sir! - That makes you who you are.

229
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,140
先生  你錢包掉了
Sir! You dropped your wallet.

230
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,540
-謝謝  -站住
- Thanks. - Stop!

231
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,920
站住  他偷了我的錢包
Stop! He stole my purse.

232
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:37,900
那是你的錢包嗎
That was your wallet?

233
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,070
是啊  你給他的那個是我的錢包
Yes, that was my wallet you just gave him.

234
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:42,310
站住
Stop!

235
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:45,380
{\an8}你是我們的  你得乖乖聽我們的話

236
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:45,720
他黑進了我的系統
He got into my system, 

237
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,140
他要我在工作電腦上播放這張CD
and he wants me to put the CD on one of the computers at work.

238
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,550
{\an8}你是我們的  你得乖乖聽我們的話

239
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:51,320
-他為什么要這么做  -我不知道  斯黛拉
- Why does he want to do that? - I don't know, Stella.

240
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,760
他沒有跟我解釋清楚
He didn't give me a full explanation.

241
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,300
那么他有我的裸照嘍
So he's got naked pics of me?

242
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,960
我們說了這么多  你就只關心
Is that the only thing you're seriously taking away

243
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,230
這件事嗎
from this conversation?

244
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:00,840
寶貝
Hey, babe.

245
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,310
跑得怎么樣
How was your run?

246
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:04,910
怪怪的
Strange.

247
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,580
有人掉了錢包
Someone dropped their wallet,

248
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:09,560
我撿起來還給他  然后有個...
and I picked it up to give it to them, but then this--

249
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,480
這有什么好奇怪的
Nothing strange about that-- 

250
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,480
只說明你的心地多么善良
just shows how good of a person you are.

251
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:13,720
一向如此
Always have been.

252
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,270
幾乎都有點過分了
Almost to a fault.

253
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:18,970
什么意思
What does that mean?

254
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,170
只是想說...
Just that you--

255
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:25,760
你對于這個世界來說太善良了
you're too good for the world.

256
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,560
也許這就是我愛你的原因吧
That's probably why I love you.

257
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,500
我要去沖個澡
I'm gonna hop in the shower.

258
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,440
我說了我不方便說話
I told you I can't talk.

259
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,740
你有100小時時間
You have 100 hours precisely.

260
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,320
之后  我們就會公布手上的一切
After that, everything we own will be released.

261
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,800
{\an8}{\pos(192,224.8)}他很快就會崩潰

262
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:17,520
單把注意力集中在記錄上還不夠
It's not enough just to focus your attention on the logs.

263
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,410
我們還得時刻關注社交媒體的動向
We should also monitor social media traffic

264
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:21,430
比如實時聊天  文檔共享平臺
as well as IRC, Pastebin.

265
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:24,130
設置一個全天候運行的腳本
And set up scripts to keep going 24/7.

266
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,150
我們說不定會撞大運
I mean, we might get lucky.

267
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,830
他們一松懈就會犯錯...
They might get sloppy, make a mistake, you know...

268
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,530
我們就生活在這種世界里
This is the world we live in.

269
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:33,140
人們利用他人犯下的錯誤
People relying on each other's mistakes

270
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:36,350
來操控別人  甚至互相利用
to manipulate one another and use one another,

271
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,480
與人產生聯系
even relate to one another.

272
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:41,360
溫馨又混亂的人性圈
A warm, messy circle of humanity.

273
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,350
艾略特
Elliot.

274
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:46,780
我請你們今晚來我家吃晚飯
I'm inviting you guys to dinner tonight.

275
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,530
雖然不如莫爾頓牛排坊  但我做的也不差
Morton's notwithstanding, I cook a mean steak.

276
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:56,890
怎么了  老板就不能請自己最喜歡的員工吃晚飯嗎
What? Can't a boss invite his favorite employees to dinner?

277
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:59,980
不  沒關系  但我有安排了
No, that's cool, but I got plans.

278
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:06,320
能讓我倆單獨談談嗎
Can you guys give us a minute?

279
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:09,400
好的
Yeah.

280
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,420
你準備告訴我發生了什么嗎
You want to tell me what's going on?

281
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:17,550
還是不了
Not really. 

282
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,590
你翹班  然后這個樣子出現
You're missing work, you come in looking like that,

283
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:21,600
還指望我不問嗎
and you expect me not to ask questions?

284
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,480
我不知道你是否希望我關心
Look, I don't know how much you want me asking

285
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,810
你的個人生活  但是
about your personal life, but--

286
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:27,900
其實完全不希望
Not at all, actually.

287
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,230
我無意冒犯
I mean, I don't mean to be rude.

288
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:35,470
我只是實話實說
I was-- I'm just being honest.

289
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:44,020
機器人先生可能發現了邪惡公司的漏洞
Mr. Robot may have found Evil Corp's bug,

290
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,680
但他沒發現我的
but he didn't find mine.

291
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:48,660
只有這樣才能保護我自己
That's the only way to protect myself.

292
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,330
絕對不能給他們看我的源代碼
Never show them my source code.

293
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:53,010
封閉自己
Close myself off.

294
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,960
創造出冰冷的完美迷宮
Create my cold, perfect maze

295
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,830
沒人能找到我
where no one can ever find me.

296
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,410
艾略特  真不敢相信你在這兒工作
Elliot, I cannot believe you work here.

297
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,150
這地方好破
This place is a shithole.

298
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,230
我想來看看你  然后一起吃午飯
Look, I thought I'd swing by, take you to lunch.

299
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:06,830
身材真好
Oh, that's nice.

300
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,870
她好像喜歡你  兄弟
I think she likes you, bud.

301
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:12,850
好吧  叫上她
All right, fine, I'll take her,

302
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:15,430
不過記住了  我在努力做個好助攻
but let the record show I was trying to be a good wingman.

303
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:17,930
冷靜點  真是的
Oh, calm down. Shit.

304
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,690
反正我也不怎么喜歡紅發妹
I'm not that into redheads anyway.

305
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:22,000
愛爾蘭這個國家總讓我萎得不行
The whole nation of Ireland makes my dick soft.

306
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,320
滾
Leave.

307
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,770
達琳說我們該談談
Darlene said we need to talk.

308
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:26,320
馬上滾蛋
Leave now.

309
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,620
沒錯  或許是不該在這兒談
You're right. Probably shouldn't talk here.

310
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,210
去隔壁的酒吧
Let's go to that bar next door.

311
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,850
我不會跟你去任何地方
I'm not going anywhere with you.

312
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,400
除非你跟我走  否則我哪也不去
I'm not going anywhere until you do,

313
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,520
要么我們在這兒鬧開
so I can hang out here and create a scene,

314
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:36,350
要么我們到隔壁酒吧談5分鐘
or you can give me five minutes at the bar next door.

315
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:37,860
不管哪種情況  我都會很開心
Either way, I'm gonna have fun.

316
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,210
任君選擇
Dealer's choice.

317
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:48,470
怎么了  這是蘋果馬提尼
What? It's an appletini.

318
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,060
我真該踹死你
I should kick your ass.

319
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:56,030
如果那就算扯平了  隨你
If that'll make us square, you have my blessing.

320
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,770
伙計  我才不想動你
Nah, man, I want nothing to do with you.

321
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:59,350
你就是個瘋子
You're a maniac.

322
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:02,860
你要什么
What can I get for you?

323
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,370
什么都不要
Uh, nothing.

324
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,110
你應該點些飲料
You should probably order something.

325
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:08,100
-我推薦這個...  -好吧
- I'd recommend this... - Fine.

326
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:13,100
我要一杯蘋果馬提尼
I'll--I'll have an appletini.

327
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,350
這算是夸你  伙計
You should take it as a compliment, guy.

328
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:18,300
這酒太他媽好喝了
These things are goddamn delicious.

329
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,720
我懂  贊美也讓我不舒服
I get it. Compliments make me uncomfortable too.

330
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,850
我覺得很難相信
I find that hard to believe.

331
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:28,490
對啊  我騙誰呢  我愛贊美
Yeah, who am I kidding? I love compliments.

332
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,410
12美元
$12.

333
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,150
我認為你沒有好好品
I really don't think you enjoyed that.

334
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:53,390
-建議你抿著喝  -最后問你一次
- I suggest sipping-- - Last chance.

335
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,700
你想要什么
What do you want?

336
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,170
我為自己的行為抱歉
I'm sorry for what I did.

337
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,460
我才不買賬
I don't buy it.

338
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,540
更重要的是  我也不在乎
More importantly, I don't give a shit.

339
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,270
我沒想傷害你
I never wanted to hurt you.

340
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,920
暴力的人所以暴力
People who get violent get that way

341
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,900
是因為不知道怎么交流
because they can't communicate.

342
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:16,980
你爸爸
Your dad,

343
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:21,650
我相信他那么做自己也不好受
I bet he felt shitty for doing what he did.

344
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,430
他肯定也想道歉
I'm sure he wanted to apologize too.

345
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,690
有時把孩子推開更容易
Sometimes pushing your kid away is just easier.

346
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:31,220
別老是生他的氣了  孩子
Don't stay mad at him too long, kiddo.

347
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:35,250
你要走嗎
You're leaving?

348
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:39,680
如你所愿  對吧
That's what you want, isn't it?

349
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,610
那你的計劃呢
What about your plan?

350
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,430
計劃
Plan?

351
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,710
你是整件事的關鍵
You're the key to the whole thing.

352
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,130
沒了你  計劃也不存在了
Without you, there is no plan.

353
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:58,330
就這樣
That's it?

354
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:00,710
都結束了
It's over?

355
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,290
你指望我信嗎
Expect me to believe that?

356
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,180
下輩子再見
See you in another life.

357
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:19,940
聽到了嗎
Did you hear that?

358
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,100
難以置信
I can't believe it.

359
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,070
真的發生了嗎
Is it really happening?

360
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,580
去社會終于結束了
Fsociety finally over.

361
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:29,550
我花了幾年時間創造出的現實世界
The recent glitch in the otherwise neat reality

362
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:31,520
除最近這個故障外一切都好
I created over the years.

363
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:34,020
我再也不會像那樣出岔子了
I'll never slip up like that again.

364
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:35,840
我現在要變得更正常
I'm gonna be more normal now.

365
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,430
也許夏拉甚至可以做我的女友
Maybe Shayla could even be my girlfriend.

366
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:41,590
我可以和她一起去看那些傻逼漫威電影
I'll go see those stupid Marvel movies with her.

367
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,200
去健身房鍛煉
I'll join a gym.

368
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,150
在圖片分享上點贊
I'll heart things on Instagram.

369
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,610
喝香草拿鐵
I'll drink vanilla lattes.

370
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,570
從現在開始過上沒有漏洞的生活
I'm gonna lead a bug-free life from now on.

371
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:55,320
為保護我的完美迷宮不惜一切
Anything to protect my perfect maze.

372
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:02,920
吉迪恩
Hey, Gideon.

373
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:07,140
今晚那個晚宴還舉行嗎
Is that dinner still on for tonight?

374
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:09,650
是的  當然
Um, yeah. Sure.

375
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,500
你想來嗎
Uh, you want to come?

376
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:13,920
是啊
Yeah.

377
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:16,870
很好
Great.

378
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,530
我能帶上女友嗎
Can I bring my girlfriend?

379
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,270
你有女朋友啊
You have a girlfriend?

380
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:28,580
還沒問過呢
Well, I, uh, haven't asked her yet,

381
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:29,780
但我會的
but I will.

382
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:32,550
希望她能答應
Hopefully she'll say yes.

383
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,230
可以  當然
Uh, yeah. Sure.

384
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:37,800
太好了
Perfect.

385
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:41,190
謝謝
Thanks.

386
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:53,770
他是在喝星巴克嗎
Was he drinking Starbucks?

387
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:11,170
你還沒把CD播出來啊
Are you still trying to rip that CD?

388
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:13,550
嗯  都劃壞了
Yeah, it's all-- it's all scratched up.

389
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:17,090
我們走吧
Let's get out of here.

390
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:23,670
{\an8}安瓦·拉齊茲  執行總裁菲利普·普萊斯個人助理

391
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:26,930
{\an8}飛吻俱樂部

392
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,340

我老板邀請我今晚去他家赴晚宴
My boss invited me to a dinner party at his place tonight.

405
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,630
你愿不愿作為我的女朋友跟我一起去
I thought you could come as my girlfriend.

406
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:35,770
什么
What?

407
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:39,670
你真是正在要我做你女朋友嗎
Are you actually asking me to be your girlfriend right now?

408
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:41,910
對
Yeah.

409
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,410
總之  我需要你
Anyway, I need you.

410
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:47,200
我不擅長處理這種社交場合
I'm not good in social situations like that.

411
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,510
你真的很有毛病
There is something seriously wrong with you.

412
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:55,290
我不要再被你利用了
I'm not gonna be used anymore.

413
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,420
你怎么不約今早那個女孩
Why don't you ask the girl from this morning, okay?

414
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,530
她看上去像是愿意跟你去什么
She seems like she might want to go to some stupid,

415
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,990
無聊的破晚宴
stuffy dinner party.

416
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,360
你并不了解我
You don't actually know me.

417
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,070
你只知道我是...
All you know is that I'm the girl...

418
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,770
我當然了解夏拉
Of course I know Shayla.

419
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:09,630
{\an8}請升級您的賬戶設置

420
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,980
她一搬進隔壁我就黑了她的電郵
I hacked her email as soon as she moved in next door.

421
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:11,240
{\an8}今天就升級您的賬戶

422
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:14,030
{\an8}密碼  現在密碼  新密碼  再次輸入

423
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,650
只靠一個簡單的網絡釣魚
With a simple phishing scam,

424
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:14,170
我就輕松拿到了她的密碼
I owned her password pretty easily.

425
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:16,210
我不是說你能在網上找到的那些
I'm not talking about the stuff you can find online.

426
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:17,860
我說的是真實的我
I'm talking about the real me.

427
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:21,700
那就告訴我吧
Tell me, then.

428
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:25,700
不  算了
No. Forget it.

429
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,800
我想知道
I want to know.

430
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:53,400
這是什么
What is this?

431
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,370
我就是把一些元素拼湊在了
I just put all the elements...

432
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:59,270
-好美  -一起
- It's beautiful. - Together.

433
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,730
這我從沒見過
I've never seen this before.

434
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,550
-她肯定...  -從沒發到網上
- She must-- - Never posted online.

435
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:04,330
很多都...
Um, I mean, a lot of them's not--

436
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:05,460
沒完成呢
they're not done.

437
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:08,710
她也有自己的私人迷宮
She's got her own private maze too.

438
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:10,450
用了很多不同的部分
Took a lot of different pieces,

439
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,330
從不同的東西上取來的
um, from different things,

440
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:16,310
我的照片  畫什么的
like from my photographs or drawings and--

441
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:18,810
看這個
Like, there's this one.

442
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:23,630
挺老套的
Um, it's really f---ing corny,

443
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:26,770
但上面什么都有  孩子什么的
but, like, it has everything-- the kids and the...

444
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:29,370
夏拉的漏洞我一直捉摸不透
Shayla's bug was always elusive to me.

445
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:30,920
或許就是這個
Maybe this was it.

446
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:34,310
渴望正常  卻卡在邊緣
Wanting normalcy but stuck in the outer fringes,

447
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,500
不知該如何參與進去
not knowing how to participate.

448
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:38,160
就像我一樣
Just like me.

449
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,210
我能吻你嗎
Can I kiss you?

450
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:55,100
下次別問了
Next time, don't ask.

451
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:56,890
太傻了
It's lame.

452
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,980
漏洞一向名聲不好
Bugs usually get a bad rap.

453
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:03,110
但有時候
But sometimes...

454
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,690
別讓我失望  好嗎
Don't let me down, okay?

455
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,370
當一個漏洞終于顯現
When a bug finally makes itself known,

456
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,660
也會讓人興奮
it can be exhilarating,

457
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,120
就像你剛剛解鎖了什么
like you just unlocked something.

458
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,990
一個美好的機會
A grand opportunity

459
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,080
就等著你去利用
waiting to be taken advantage of.

460
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,250
威利克先生
Mr. Wellick?

461
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,960
你叫什么來著
What was your name again?

462
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:36,450
安瓦
Anwar.

463
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:38,730
我不知道你也來這種地方
I didn't know you came to places like this.

464
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,140
我不來
I don't.

465
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,870
什么意思  你不是來了嗎
What do you mean? You're here now.

466
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,010
我來是因為你
I'm here because you are.

467
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:48,930
什么  抱歉  我不懂
What? Sorry, I don't get it.

468
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:52,430
我覺得你很美  我想帶你回家
I think you're beautiful. I want to take you home.

469
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,430
等等  你不是結婚了嗎
Wait, I thought you were married.

470
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:00,940
因為  畢竟  漏洞唯一的作用
Because, after all, a bug's only purpose,

471
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:03,440
它存在的唯一原因
its only reason for existence

472
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:06,520
就是作為等待修補的錯誤
is to be a mistake that needs fixing,

473
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,880
幫你糾正錯誤
to help you right a wrong.

474
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,590
有什么比這感覺更棒的呢
And what feels better than that?

475
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:21,600
艾略特
So, Elliot,

476
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:25,000
你不介紹一下嗎
do you think you should introduce us?

477
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:30,000
夏拉  這是安吉拉和奧利
Oh, um, Shayla, this is Angela and Ollie.

478
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:35,400
你今晚很美
You, uh, you look lovely this evening.

479
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,030
好啊  伙計們
What up, guys?

480
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:42,430
你們才到嗎
You just get here?

481
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:44,270
西裝不錯
Nice suit.

482
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,590
謝了  伙計
Thanks, dude.

483
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:54,140
-該死  -你是怎么了
- Shit. - What is up with you?

484
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:55,690
你這一晚上都煩躁不安的
You've been fidgeting all night.

485
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,510
我們再按一次門鈴吧
Maybe we should try the doorbell again.

486
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,630
你們好啊
Hey, guys.

487
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,540
你們站多久了
How long have you been standing out here?

488
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,800
門鈴壞了  我該說一聲的
The doorbell is broken. I should have warned you.

489
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,710
請進吧  我是哈利
Come in. I'm Harry, by the way.

490
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:14,940
-安吉拉  認識你很高興  -認識你很高興
- Angela. Nice to meet you. - Good to meet you.

491
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,200
很高興終于能對上
Always nice to put a face... 

492
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,340
員工號和臉了
with an employee badge number, right?

493
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:20,850
奧利  你們在一起多久了
Ollie, how long have you guys been together?

494
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,090
-兩年半  -兩年
- 2 1/2 years. - 2 years.

495
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,070
好吧
Okay.

496
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,660
艾略特  你和夏拉在一起多久了
Elliot, how long have you and Shayla been together?

497
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,320
這個
Well, uh, um,

498
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:36,460
就今天才開始
j-just today.

499
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:48,570
好了  你審夠客人了吧
Okay, enough grilling of the guests.

500
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:50,640
我們去看看烤爐吧
Let's check on the real grill, shall we?

501
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,870
艾略特  幫幫忙
Elliot, I could use your help.

502
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,110
我要向你承認件事
So I have a confession.

503
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:59,540
我讓杜勒斯數據中心的系統管理員
I had the sys admins at the data center in Dulles

504
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,820
又去看了一遍那個服務器
check that server again.

505
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:03,870
吉迪恩  你做了什么
Gideon, what did you do?

506
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:05,520
當然了  根本沒找到什么
Of course there was nothing.

507
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,930
我真不知道我為什么要起疑
I have no idea what there was to even be suspicious about.

508
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:11,700
你會有什么動機
I mean, what possible motivation would you have

509
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:13,880
去搞破壞  我大概只是...
to do anything? I guess I was just being--

510
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,510
吉迪恩必須放手
Gideon has to let this go.

511
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,170
如果他靠近這個馬蜂窩
If he comes near this hornet's nest,

512
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:19,150
我不知道我是不是能救下他
I'm not sure I can save him from it.

513
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:21,370
我得消除他任何的疑慮
I have to kill any suspicion left.

514
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:23,940
你在眾安一直努力工作
You've been nothing but a hard worker for Allsafe,

515
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:27,870
所以  我道歉
so I apologize.

516
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,170
我們在飛機上聊過之后
After the conversation on the plane,

517
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:36,910
我認識到這關系到整個公司的命運
I knew what was at stake-- the whole company.

518
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:40,940
我擔心我找到的dat文件并不是要緊的那個
I was worried that the dat file I found wasn't the right one.

519
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,590
我就是不想...
I just didn't

520
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,840
讓你抱有希望  以免是我錯了
want to get your hopes up in case I was wrong.

521
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:49,820
所以會面之前我并沒跟你說
That's why I didn't tell you before the meeting.

522
00:28:58,430 --> 00:28:59,690
該死
Shit.

523
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:02,100
我得讓他抱我了  是嗎
I'm gonna have to let him hug me, aren't I?

524
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:11,720
你真是個優秀的工程師  艾略特
You're such a brilliant engineer, Elliot,

525
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:13,900
你絕對不要懷疑自己的才華
and you should never doubt your skills

526
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,760
不管我給了你多大壓力
no matter how much pressure I put on you.

527
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:18,150
而且你更不用對我有所隱瞞
And you certainly don't have to keep anything from me.

528
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:20,200
我關心你
I care about you.

529
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:41,640
《巴茲爾弗蘭維勒太太的混亂檔案》
From the Mixed-up Files of Basil E. Frankweiler.

530
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,350
我就是受了那個的啟發  記得嗎
That's where I got the idea, remember?

531
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:48,610
我是那么想做克勞迪婭·金凱德[書中人物]
I wanted to be Claudia Kincaid so bad.

532
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:52,200
就連她的名字都那么酷
Even her name was cool.

533
00:29:56,870 --> 00:30:01,640
記得嗎  我們以為我們是去的大都會博物館
Remember we thought we were going to the Met,

534
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,730
結果不知卻怎么跑到了皇后區博物館
somehow we ended up at the Queens Museum instead?

535
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:10,290
當時可沒有谷歌地圖
No Google Maps back then.

536
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:14,880
我喜歡跟你離家出走
I loved running away with you.

537
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,990
八歲的時候
Somehow when you're eight,

538
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:22,750
離家出走還挺好玩的
running away can be fun.

539
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,870
正常生活
The normal life.

540
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,750
說說笑笑  赴晚宴
Smiles, dinner parties,

541
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:32,000
童年回憶
childhood stories.

542
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,110
我可以習慣這樣的生活
I could get used to this,

543
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,900
甚至喜歡上它
maybe even like it.

544
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:51,650
怎么了
What's wrong?

545
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,720
...入侵丑聞仍在繼續
Corp's hacking scandal continues

546
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,850
現在又有大量電郵被放出
with the release of these latest emails.

547
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:02,000
{\an8}首席技術官泰瑞·科比涉嫌與93年泄露事件有關  邪惡公司遭竊數據顯示重大掩蓋事件

548
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:03,560
根據最新遭披露的資料顯示
Information stemming from the latest dump reveals

549
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,780
泰瑞·科比與另外兩位高管

550
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:09,810
共同參與了掩蓋廣為人知的

552
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:12,230
{\an8}有毒廢料丑聞

553
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:13,600
如果這些報道屬實
If these reports are true,

554
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,130
科比可能將面臨更多指控
Colby may be facing more indictments.

555
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:17,620
1993年曾有傳聞
In the ensuing 24 months

556
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:21,070
稱發生有毒廢料泄露事件  隨后兩年中
after the alleged toxic waste leak in 1993,

557
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:25,240
有26名員工死于類型相似的白血病
26 employees died from similar types of leukemia.

558
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:28,380
然而邪惡公司卻得以駁回了幸存受害者
Evil Corp, however, managed to get the class-action lawsuit

559
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:31,880
提出的集體訴訟
filed against it by the surviving victims dismissed,

560
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,130
聲稱并無證據能表明
claiming there was no direct evidence linking

561
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:36,570
其工廠與確診病例有關
their factories to the diagnoses.

562
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:39,510
而如今泄露的郵件表明科比實際上
Now these emails indicate that Colby was in fact 

563
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:42,280
了解毒物的危險程度
aware of the dangerous levels of toxicity

564
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,940
卻依然對此保密  因為
and kept it a secret as it

565
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:47,770
"即使可能面臨訴訟  重組現有
"Would not be cost-effective to retool the current systems

566
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:52,110
系統仍是得不償失"
in place even if there are potential lawsuits."

567
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,840
科比先生不能對此作出回應  但其律師稱
Mr. Colby was unavailable for comment, but his lawyer...

568
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,600
我的完美迷宮
My perfect maze

569
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,500
在我眼前崩潰了
crumbling before my eyes.

570
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,880
數據公布進一步證明科比是遭到了陷害
Data dump are further proof Colby was set up,

571
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,390
但他們并未指明是誰干的
but they didn't indicate by whom.

572
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,280
我再無法隱藏了
There's nothing to hide behind.

573
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,340
我還以為不存在  但確實有的
I didn't think it existed, but there it was.

574
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,220
現在有了
Is.

575
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:13,470
機器人先生終于找到了我的漏洞
Mr. Robot finally found my bug.

576
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:16,090
...將華盛頓鎮廢料量
Linking the waste levels in Washington Township

577
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:18,160
與受害者疾病關聯起來
to the victims' illnesses.

578
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,870
法律分析員支持這一說法
Legal analysts support the claim

579
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:21,460
的確沒有足夠證據證明...
that there is not enough evidence...

580
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:22,410
怎么回事
What's going on?

581
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:26,720
我媽媽和艾略特的爸爸就是這么...
That's how my mom, um, and Elliot's dad--

582
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:28,260
-我得走了  -等等
- I have to go. - Wait, wait.

583
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,740
-我跟你一起走吧  -不  還是別了
- Let me come with you. - No, I'd rather you didn't.

584
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,810
...華盛頓鎮丑聞證據
Evidence in the Washington Township scandal.

585
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:34,720
泰瑞·科比仍在接受調查
Terry Colby remains under investigation

586
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,100
關于其在這件事中的...
for his alleged involvement with the...

587
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:40,020
...駁回...并無證據能
Dismissed because there was no evidence

588
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:42,050
將華盛頓鎮廢料量...
linking the waste levels in Washington Township...

589
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:43,260
邪惡公司
Evil Corp...

590
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,460
別那么苦著臉
Don't look so sad.

591
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:48,230
他是自己作死
He did this to himself.

592
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,150
他放棄了  他是個懦夫
He gave in. He was a coward.

593
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:53,280
他軟弱  可悲
He was weak and pathetic.

594
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,260
說到底  這才是害死你父親的
And in the end, that's what killed your father.

595
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,290
你為什么在哭
Why are you crying?

596
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,880
別問那么多問題
Don't ask so many questions.

597
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:05,180
我想他
I miss him.

598
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,290
這毫無意義
There's no point to that.

599
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,470
但我就是想他
But I do.

600
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:11,720
那你也跟他一樣軟弱
Then you're just as weak as him.

601
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:13,870
你不難過嗎
You're not sad?

602
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,260
我憑什么
Why should I be?

603
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:19,410
夜色多美
It's a beautiful night.

604
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:22,510
天氣也這么好
The weather is nice,

605
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:24,730
我在好好抽煙
and I'm enjoying my cigarette.

606
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:33,040
漏洞逼迫軟件去適應
The bug forces the software to adapt,

607
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,680
因其存在而進化成新的東西
evolve into something new because of it.

608
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:38,190
要么繞過它  要么撐過去
Work around it or work through it.

609
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:41,670
不管怎樣  軟件都得改變
No matter what, it changes.

610
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:44,370
變成新的東西
It becomes something new.

611
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,140
新版本
The next version.

612
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,210
不可避免的升級
The inevitable upgrade.

613
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,450
你真是個怪人
You're a strange creature.

614
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:36,130
我就是個生意人
I'm just a businessman.

615
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:44,470
我只能擦這么干凈了
And that's about as clean as I'm gonna get it.

616
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,000
你去洗澡吧
You have to do the rest in the shower.

617
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:49,400
我不介意臟一點
I don't mind being a little dirty.

618
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:50,840
我介意
I do.

00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:15,200
嗯  就過去
Yeah, I'll be there in a minute.

631
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,790
抱歉我那樣跑掉了
I'm sorry that I ran off like that.

632
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:37,620
你跟他談了嗎
Did you talk to him?

633
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,520
沒有  他不在家
Nope. He wasn't home.

634
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,500
我在
Well, I'm here.

635
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,560
我樂意跟你談談
I want to talk to you about everything,

636
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,120
但今晚不行  好嗎
just not tonight, okay?

637
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:48,310
你愿意跟他談  卻不愿跟自己男友談嗎
So you talk to him but not your own boyfriend?

638
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,710
這不一樣  奧利
It's different, Ollie.

639
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:51,820
我們都有親人死于...
Both of our parents died because...

640
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,790
我們就是這么認識的
That's how we know each other.

641
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:00,350
我現在真不想談這個
I really don't want to talk about this right now.

642
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:02,610
如果我想呢
What if I do?

643
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:05,590
想什么
What if you do what?

644
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,080
想談談
Want to talk.

645
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:10,980
關于
About...

646
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:13,740
一件事
something.

647
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:20,120
你說什么呢
What the hell are you talking about?

648
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:24,370
我有事要告訴你
I have to tell you something.

649
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:28,510
我真不知道你干嗎要這么折磨自己
I don't know why you're putting yourself through this.

650
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:30,890
你不用一直翻看的
You don't have to keep looking at it.

651
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:33,310
這毫無意義
All right? It meant nothing.

652
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,340
我知道這話我說好多遍了
Okay, I know I sound like a broken record,

653

{\an8}安吉拉·莫斯賬戶概覽

但我愛的是你  我想跟你在一起
but I love you, and I want to be with you.

655
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,580
別說話了
Stop speaking.

656
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:48,150
告訴我  要怎么樣
Just tell me what you need

657
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:51,010
我才能彌補  我會做的
in order for me to fix this, and I'll do it.

658
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,910
我們得分手
We need to break up.

659
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,090
安吉拉  別這樣
Angela, come on.

660
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:02,850
你還給我別的選擇了嗎  奧利
What choice did you give me, Ollie?

661
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:04,650
我知道我有問題
Look, I know I have a problem.

662
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:05,460
我不否認
I'm not denying that.

663
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,660
或許我的問題就是
Well, maybe my problem is

664
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:09,360
我不能跟有你這種問題的人在一起
I can't be with a guy with your problem.

665
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,080
CD在哪
Where's the CD?

666
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,110
在我包里  怎么了
It's in my-- in my bag. Why?

667
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,250
他掌握了我的銀行賬戶  奧利
He has my bank account, Ollie.

668
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:22,560
-還有我爸的銀行賬戶  -怎么...
- And my dad's bank account. - How did they--

669
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,740
因為我的學生貸款  我們的賬戶是相連的
Our accounts are linked because of my student loans.

670
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:26,910
我用你的筆記本登錄過
I used your laptop to access it.

671
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:28,510
他拿到了我爸的社保信息
He has my dad's social security,

672
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:30,760
他的信用卡密碼  所有一切
his credit card numbers, everything.

673
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:32,650
好吧
Okay.

674
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:33,970
好吧  這可不妙
Okay, that is bad,

675
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:35,640
但警察肯定能...
but I'm sure the cops will figure out a way--

676
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,920
如果你不照這人說的做
If we don't do what this guy says

677
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,680
而我們去找警察  他會把這些信息
and we go to the cops, then he's just going to sell

678
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,970
賣給出價最高的人
our information to the highest bidder,

679
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:43,320
我和我爸爸就完全毀了
and me and my dad are completely screwed.

680
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:46,030
你知道遭遇這樣的
Do you have any idea how difficult it is

681
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,820
大規模身份盜竊  要恢復過來有多難嗎
to come back from massive identity theft like this?

682
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:51,090
你什么意思
What are you saying?

683
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:59,590
安吉拉  你瘋了嗎
Angela, are you crazy?

684
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:02,840
不  我們不能為此就
No, we cannot just infect Allsafe's network

685
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:04,230
感染眾安的網絡
because of this.

686
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,970
我會丟了工作的
I'll lose my job.

687
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,300
說到點子上了
And there it is.

688
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:18,040
你也會丟工作的
You'll lose your job too,

689
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:19,760
如果你在乎的話
if that matters.

690
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:25,160
再說  即便我們照做
Besides, even if we put the CD in,

691
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,770
你怎么知道這人就不會還是賣掉信息呢
who says this guy won't just do all this anyway?

692
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,840
過來
Hey, hey, come here.

693
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,130
看著我

710
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:14,780
{\an8}{\pos(191.4,220)}怎么不行了

711
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:18,080
{\an8}{\pos(191.4,220)}我累了

712
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:21,410
{\an8}{\pos(191.4,220)}我不管

713
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:24,960
{\an8}{\pos(191.4,220)}要紅的

714
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,720
{\an8}{\pos(191.4,220)}工作得如何了

715
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:40,720
{\an8}{\pos(191.4,220)}還在進行中

716
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,020
{\an8}{\pos(191.4,220)}那么說你失敗了

717
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:45,060
{\an8}{\pos(191.4,220)}進行怎么就成失敗了

718
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:48,400
{\an8}{\pos(191.4,220)}反正不是成功

719
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:56,530
{\an8}{\pos(191.4,220)}再緊點

{\an8}{\pos(191.4,220)}你不覺得那樣太明顯了嗎

727
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:28,600
{\an8}{\pos(192,199.2)}雖然我想  但我們似乎沒時間遮遮掩掩的了

728
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:40,700
{\an8}{\pos(191.4,220)}你還沒弄完呢

730
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:51,570
{\an8}{\pos(191.4,220)}我們商量過了

731
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,270
{\an8}{\pos(191.4,220)}就一小會兒

732
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,090
計劃是這樣的
Here's the plan.
