比利!
快點給我出來
Billy Boy!
Get your ass ready.
差不多5點了, 我們有酒宴
lt's almost 5:00, and this bad boy
needs to get his drink on.
- 不,不行,給我
- 別這樣
- No, no, no. Give me that.
- Don't.
- 我一定要把它燒掉
- 停下
- l'm gonna burn it once and for all.
- Stop that.
老兄,已經六個月了
是該換一個了,不是嗎?
Dude, it's been six months.
lt's time to move on, okay?
不管怎樣,就算我碰到了其他女人
Whatever. Even if
l wanted to meet other women,
我甚至都不知道該怎麼做了
l wouldn't even know what to do.
我離開這種遊戲太久了
l've been out of the game
for so long.
老兄,今晚和我一起出去
我保證你能泡到一個
Dude, you come out with me tonight,
l promise you will get laid.
是啊,聽起來非常誘人
Yeah, it sounds very tempting,
但是貝爾森要我校正這些金融議案
but Berenson needs me to update
these financial models
準備下次和外國投資者的會議
for the meeting
with the foreign investors.
那又怎樣?
今天是週末
So what?
lt's Friday night.
德國人提早飛回來了
The Germans are taking
an early flight back.
會議改在明天進行
The meeting got changed
to tomorrow.
為什麼不叫其他人做?
So? Why don't you
just get somebody else
做你的工作?
to do your work for you?
叫誰?
Who?
哈樂德,我需要你幫忙校正這些議案
Harold, l need you to update
those models for me.
- 比利,你不是打算自己——
- 我知道,突然有些事情
- Billy, aren't you supposed to--
- l know. Something just came up.
今天晚上我和客戶們有個會議
l have this meeting
with these new clients tonight,
沒時間幹這些了
and l'm never gonna have time
to get to those.
現在這些交給你了,好傢伙
So that's your
responsibility now, big boy.
確保明早九點之前一定要完成
Make sure those are in
by 9:00 sharp tomorrow.
現在裁員之風盛行
With all the downsizing
that's been going on around here,
我們不想告訴貝爾森你行事馬虎,對嗎?
we wouldn't want to have to tell Berenson
you've been slacking, now would we?
好的
Yeah.
好吧,沒問題
Okay, no problem.
嘿
Hey.
祝你週末愉快,夥計
You have a great weekend,
okay, buddy?
我欠你一個人情,就一個
l owe you one.
Just one.
謝謝
Thank you.
喔!這麼簡單就搞定,真令人驚奇
Wow! That was amazing.
l cannot believe how easy that was.
老兄,你覺得我的餿主意怎麼樣
Dude, how do you think
l get all my shit done?
我跟你說,那些亞洲人喜歡幹這些
l'm telling you, those Asian guys
love crunching numbers.
你或許剛好讓他有個充實的週末
You probably
just made his weekend.
Clhick magrnet
Clhick magrnet. clhick magrnet
Clhick magrnet. yealh
媽的
Fuck.
好極了,派特先生
An excellent point, Mr. Patel.
你是我會見過最好的申請者之一
You are one of the finest applicants
l have ever interviewed.
謝謝
Thank you.
不奇怪,你父親在他的領域也倍受尊敬
lt comes as no surprise. Your father
is highly respected in his field.
你一定從父親那裏聽說過了
As you probably heard
from your old man,
我和他在學校裏有一些瘋狂的回憶
he and l had some pretty wild times
back in med school.
真的嗎?
Really?
是的,我們創立了自己的籃球隊－－
Yeah. We started
our own basketball team--
Hemoglobin Trotters 校隊
the Hemoglobin Trotters.
Hemo-globin Trotters－－
清楚了嗎?
Hemo-globin Trotters--
get it?
我們經常參加著名的黑人籃球賽
A play on the name of the famous
colored, Negro basketball squad--
黑人,美籍非裔人
black, African-American.
你知道,有色人種
You know, people of colors.
最後來一個問題吧,只是形式上的
Let's end up with one final question,
just as a formality.
胰腺炎有哪些潛在的症狀?
What are some potential
symptoms of pancreatitis?
嗯,你的腹上部會比較敏感
Well, you would have
epigastric tenderness,
一直擴散到腹部...
diffuse abdominal tenderness...
抱歉,能等下嗎?
l'm sorry.
Can you hold on one second?
喂,我是卡瑪
Kumar's phone.
Kumar speaking.
嘿,怎麼樣?是我,你在做什麼?
Hey, what's up? lt's me.
What are you doing?
沒什麼重要的事,我能交談,
有什麼事情嗎?
Nothing important. l can talk.
What's going on?
聽著,今晚不能辦派對了,好嗎?
我必須呆在辦公室晚點回去
Listen, l can't party tonight, okay?
l gotta stay late at the office.
老兄,你他媽的別放狗屁,我們計畫好了
Dude, fuck that shit.
We had plans.
我知道,但我有許多工作要幹
l know, but l got
a lot of work to do.
當你陶醉於大麻就不會想到工作了
When has getting high ever
prevented you from doing your work?
天啊!
Jesus!
相信我,我會儘快趕回去的,好嗎?
Believe me.
l would love to come lhome. okay?
- 我有許多的工作要做
- 謝謝,我自己來
- l got a lot of work to do.
- Thank you. l'll do that.
我從紐約帶回了一些最好的大麻
l got a quarter of the
finest herb in New York City.
我總不能一個人享受,對嗎?
l'm not smoking
that shit alone, okay?
所以你就別管那些事
做好思想準備
So you need to just chill the fuck out
and prepare to get blazed
因為在接下來的幾個小時裏,
because in the next couple of hours,
我希望我們一塊兒神遊體外
爽到極點, 你明白麼?
l expect both of us to be
blitzed out of our skulls, got it?
好的,我明白了
All right, l got it.
我等下再和你談
我說到哪兒了?
l'll talk to you later.
Where was l?
然後會有一些肛門排泄物，有時還
很嚴重--即a.k.a. 腹瀉.
We've got the severe anal discharge,
sometimes violent--a.k.a. diarrhea.
派特先生, 我比你更熟悉腹瀉
Mr. Patel, l am more than familiar
with diarrhea.
你居然還認為看過你的行為舉止後
Do you actually believe
after the way you've just behaved
我還會考慮推薦你入學嗎?
that l would ever even consider
recommending you for admission?
沒有,我只想對你說實話
No. l'm gonna
be honest with you.
我申請的唯一原因
The only reason l'm applying
是那樣我爸爸會繼續付我的房租
is so my dad
will keep paying for my apartment.
我真的從沒渴望進入哪個醫學院
l really don't have a desire
to go to med school.
但你醫學院入學考試得了高分
But you have perfect MCAT scores.
是啊，但那就象你那玩意
壯得跟駝鹿似的
Yeah. Just 'cause you're
hung like a moose
也不意味著你要去拍色情片
doesn't mean you gotta do porn.
出去! 伯納黛特
把這個男人帶出去
Get out! Bernadette,
show this young man to the door!
還有請拿一些新鮮的腹瀉--乾毛巾進來
And please bring in
some fresh diarrhe--dry towels!
好的!
Yes!
剛好能停在門口
Right in front of the door.
這是在美國,老兄!
先學會怎麼開車!
This is America, dude!
Learn how to drive!
最好明天就去學吧!
Better ''ruck'' tomorrow!
- 刺激!
- 該死的混蛋
- Extreme!
- Fucking assholes.
媽的
Fuck.
好的
Okay.
自信點
別緊張
Be yourself.
Don't be nervous.
那個,瑪利亞,最近忙些什麼呢?
So, Maria, what's been goin' on?
整整忙了一周的工作,你呢?
l actually had a very long week
at work. How about you?
工作還不錯,
能找到一些空閒
Work was good.
l caught up on some sleep.
還有,我旁邊的同事決定跳槽換工作
Plus, the guy who works next to me
decided to bathe for a change.
真的嗎?
Really?
那你今晚準備幹些什麼呢?
So what are you up to tonight?
事實上,只能呆在家裏
Actually, l'm just gonna
be sitting on my ass,
大概會在看的時候
probably eat a whole pint
of H?agen-Dazs
吃許多哈根達斯
while l watch Blirnd Date.
噢,看起來挺糟糕
Well, that sounds awful.
如果你需要一些同伴
lf you want some company,
可以到我的地方來坐坐
maybe you can come over
and sit on your ass at my place.
聽起來不錯
That sounds nice.
拜
Bye.

唷,我在這兒,老兄
Yo, l'm in here, dude.
嘿,你究竟在幹些什麼?
Hey! What the hell are you doing?
我在清理我的陰毛
l'm trimming my pubes.
為什麼不在你的房間裏幹這個,夥計
Why aren't you
doing this in your room, man?
鏡子在這裏
嘿,看看,像不像棵盆景樹
The mirror's in here.
Hey, check it out. lt's like a bonsai tree.
嘿!
Hey!
還有,夥計,這樣能讓你的傢伙看起來更大
Besides, man, it makes
your johnson look totally bigger.
拜託!
Please!
那是我的剪刀嗎?
老兄,我用這個來剪鼻毛!
Are those my scissors?
Dude, l trim my nose hair with those!
老兄,我已經用這個剪了六個月的屁毛
Dude, l've been cutting my ass hair
with them for the past six months.
出去!
從我的房間出去
Get out!
Get out of my room.
卡瑪,我是老爸
Kumar. it's Daddy.

沒關係,老兄
我們去吃點什麼
No shit, dude.
Let's eat.
不,我今晚不想叫外賣
No, l don't feel

- 去肯德基怎麼樣?

- What about KFC?
- We've been there too many times.
我想來點最近我們沒吃過的

一些不同的,
恰到好處的食物
Something different,

我想要完美的食物

我有幾年沒有去過白色城堡了

老兄, 我跟你說, 在新不倫瑞克的
百貨市場那就有一家連鎖店
Dude, l'm telling you, there's one right by
that multiplex in New Brunswick.
妙極了
Nice.
- 羅森柏格!

唷,好一對傢伙,起來了
我們去白色城堡
Yo, Manny and Shevitz, get up.
We're going to White Castle.
不,我們在看電視
No, we're watching
Tlhe Gift on HBO.
不,不,不,別看了,我們餓得要死
No, no, no.
No watching. We're starving.
嘿,放回去
Hey, put that back.
到白色城堡之前別吃東西,我們出發吧
No eating until we get
to White Castle. Let's roll.
抱歉,孩子們
我們哪兒也不去
Sorry, kids,
we ain't going nowhere.
按照推測,凱蒂在這部片子裏要露乳頭了
Supposedly Katie Holmes
shows her titties in this movie.
你們猶太人成天就想著這些--乳頭嗎?
ls that all you Jews
ever think about--tits?
凱蒂 福爾摩斯是個令人尊敬的健康好女孩
Katie Holmes is a nice,
respectable, wholesome girl.
我一定要看到她的咪咪.
And l'm gonna see her boobs.
我完全被她的屁股迷住了
--你不會知道的!
The things l would eat
out of her ass--you have no idea!
這是個很平實的說法.
That is
a completely vulgar statement.
就象 ''我一直想在浴室地板上搞小甜甜布蘭尼''
So is ''l want to bang Britney Spears
on the bathroom floor.''
但這是真的
But it's true.
說的不錯.
Touch��.
嗨, 聽著, 如果--
Hey, listen, if--
我覺著卡瑪是個玻璃.
l think Kumar's a faygele.
他們完全是在搞同性戀
They're totally gay for each other.
- 嘿,你要吸點這個嗎?
- 嗯
- Hey, you wanna suck on this?
- Uh-huh.
你幹嘛要帶著你的包出來?
What the hell are you
bringing your bag for?
設法在車裏完成點工作
Try to get some work done
in the car.
- 鑰匙給你,你開車
- 操,我忘了帶手機
- Here, you're driving.
- Shit, l forgot my cell phone.
你要跑回去拿嗎?
You wanna run back and get it?
不,我們走太遠了
No, we've gone too far.
嘿,你女朋友在那兒
Hey, there's your girlfriend.
這次你是要跟她聊幾句,
You gonna talk to her this time,
還是永遠做個縮頭烏龜?
or are you gonna be
a Vagina McGinastein about it?
你到底在幹嘛?
What the hell are you doing?
你也許可以問她願不願意
跟我們一起去白色城堡
You could've asked her if she wanted
to come to White Castle with us.
- 電梯,等下!
- 嘿,你好--
- Hold the elevator. Wait!
- Hey, how are--
你真沒用
You're worthless.
我不值得去做
l'm not worthwhile.
只要跟她談一次
就不會這麼尷尬了
Just fucking talk to her once.
lt won't be weird anymore.
瞧,沒關係
Look, it doesn't matter.
鍾情于我的女孩
我卻對她沒有興趣
The only girls who are interested in me
are girls l have no interest in.
比如金辛蒂
Like Cindy Kim.
說到辛蒂,
她早些時候來電話了
Speaking of Cindy,
she called earlier.
她加入的一個亞洲人俱樂部
今晚在她宿舍舉行派對
One of those Asian clubs she's in
is throwing a party at her dorm tonight.
天啊,她什麼事情都邀請我
God, she invites me to everything.
那又怎麼樣?她多可愛
讓她上你吧
So what? She's kind of fuckin' cute.
Let her touch your penis.
噢,看啊
Oh, look.
是同性戀兄弟
lt's the Brothers McFag.
讓我猜猜--拿包的那個是“打擊者”.
Let me guess--the one
with the purse is the catcher.
來吧，小子們，我們一塊喝點烈的威士卡吧.
Come on, guys, let's get ourselves
some fucking Mountain Dew.
刺激!
Extreme!
沒錯, 刺激的臭小子們.
Yeah, extreme assholes.
為什麼我要當“打擊者”?
Why do l
have to be the catcher?
老兄,忘了那些屌人
全心全意去吃東西吧
Dude, forget about those pricks.
Let's just get some food.
我太餓了,我將要吃掉
20個那樣的漢堡,夥計
l am so hungry. l'm gonna eat,
like, 20 of those burgers, man.
老兄,我會看你吃下20個,
並且還幫你買5包炸薯條
Dude, fuckin' l will see your 20 burgers
and raise you 5 orders of fries.
老兄,給我35美分
Dude, give me 35 cents.
怎麼了?沒用
What's going on?
lt didn't register.
- 什麼?
- 再給我35美分
- What?
- Give me 35 more cents.
- 我沒有零錢了
- 我就這樣闖過這裏嗎?
- l don't have any more change.
- Should l just go through?
不,不,我不想違法
No, no, l don't like
breaking the law.
是啊,我能懂
Yeah, l can see that.
嘿,快點滾開!
Hey, move your ass!
- 對不起,等一下
- 我要闖了
- l'm sorry. Hold on.
- l'm going through.
不,不要
不,不,等下
No, don't.
No. No. Hold on.
讓我去人工收費亭那告訴他們發生了什麼
Let me walk to a manned tollbooth
and l'll tell them what happened.
- 抱歉!
- 快走開,混蛋!
- Sorry!
- Move, you fuckin' twat!
- 這裏被什麼鬼東西堵住了?
- 操
- What's the fuckin' holdup here?
- Shit.
滾開, 你們兩個白癡!
滾開!
Move, you retarded cocksucker!
Move!
- 你瘋了嗎?
- 什麼?
- Are you crazy?
- What?
你在幹什麼?
為什麼把大麻扔出去了?!
What are you doing?
Why you throwing the weed out?!
- 巡警會抓住我們的
- 不,他們不會,不會為了那個
- The cops are gonna catch us.
- No, they're not. Not for that.
- 走這個出口
- 什麼?
- Take this exit.
- What?
- 走這個出口!
- 不!
- Take this exit!
- No!
老兄!
Dude!
你知道,
那是我們最後的一點大麻了
You know,
that was the last of our weed.
抱歉,有時候我有一點妄想狂症狀
Sorry. l get a little
paranoid sometimes.
現在我們到了這個
臭名昭著的鬼地方
Now we're in Newark,
of all places.
你知道我們會被槍殺的
You know we're
gonna get shot.
可能不像人們說的那麼糟糕
可能只是一個騙局
Maybe it's not as bad as they say.
Maybe it's just a bunch of hype.
看啊,那些傢伙好像沒看到我們
Check it out. Those guys
look like a lame version of us.
- 操他媽的!
- 操他媽的!
- Holy shit!
- Holy shit!
快離開這個鬼地方
Let's get the fuck outta here.
- 快!快!加速!加速!
- 那是你的錯
- Go! Go! Drive! Drive!
- Yeah, that was your fault.
- 操你
- 操你
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.
唷,看啊,我們快到了
Yo, check it out.
We're almost there.
謝天謝地,我快餓死了
Thank God. l'm starving.
- 你好,新不倫瑞克!
- 準備大吃一頓了
- Hello, New Brunswick!
- Prepare to gorge yourself.
你知道--
我們需要來點音樂
You know--
We need some tunage for this.
我放好了,放我預先裝置的那些
Presets. Use the presets.
噢,老兄
你生命裏所有東西都是預先裝置的
Oh, come on, dude,
your whole life is preset.
來點新鮮的
Try something new.
這是哪兒? 白色城堡不是就在這附近嗎?
Where is this place? lsn't it
supposed to be right around here?
- 掃興,我們會找到它的
- 等下---那個是百貨商場嗎?
- Chill. We'll find it.
- Wait a second--is that the multiplex?
- 是的
- 妙極了!
- Yes.
- Sweet!
那意味著白色城堡就在這個轉角
That means the White Castle
should be right around the corner.
卡瑪,到底怎麼回事?
What the hell
is going on, Kumar?
我看那個不太像是白色城堡
That does not look
like a White Castle to me.
啊哈
老兄,我們必須去看一看
Uh-uh.
Dude, we gotta check this out.
嘿,看這裏,夥計
你們要從車行道排隊預定
Hey, look here, fellas. You guys gonna
have to order from the drive-thru menu.
白色城堡去哪兒了?
What happened to the White Castle?
什麼?
What?
這個位置曾經有一個白色城堡
There used to be a White Castle
right here in this location.
它在哪兒?
Where is it?
我不願告訴你們壞消息,兄弟
l hate to be the bearer
of bad news, guys,
Shack漢堡店四年前買了這個地方
but Burger Shack, they bought
this location about four years ago.
天啊!
God!
請告訴我城裏哪兒還有白色城堡?
Please tell me there's
another White Castle in town.
- 沒有
- 你確信?
- No.
- Are you sure?
我看起來像那種
Do l look like the kind of brother
對那些事情還不確信的傢伙嗎?
that would be unsure
about something like that?
操!
那我們怎麼辦?
Shit!
What are we gonna do?
我不知道,我們應該就在這裏解決嗎?
l don't know, man.
Should we just eat here?
嘿,喂
Hey. Psst.
在徹裏希爾鎮有一家24小時白色城堡店
There's a White Castle that's
open 24 hours up in Cherry Hill.
離這有45分鐘車程
lt's about
45 minutes from here.
如果你想去我開車
l can make the trip
if you're willing to.
卡瑪,我有一大堆的工作要完成
Kumar, l got a shitload
of work to finish.
你明天還有醫學院的面試
You got that
med school interview.
別提那個面試了
那無關緊要
Forget about the med school
interview. lt's a non-issue.
什麼叫無關緊要?
What do you mean
it's a non-issue?
叮-咚!
我能插一句話嗎?
Ding-dong!
May l interject for a second?
作為三年來Shack漢堡店的員工,
As a Burger Shack employee
for the past three years,
如果有一件事我學到了,
那就是假如你渴望去白色城堡,
if there's one thing l've learned,
it's that if you're craving White Castle,
這裏的漢堡絕對不能滿足你
the burgers here
just don't cut it.
事實上, 只要想一下那些溫柔嬌小
白色城堡的漢堡包
ln fact, just thinking about those
tender little White Castle burgers
夾著細碎的烤洋蔥
with those little, itty-bitty grilled onions
像風味水晶一樣在你的嘴裏爆發
that just explode
in your mouth like flavor crystals
每咬上一口...
every time you bite into one...
...就讓我想要把這個
不要臉的地方燒為平地
...just makes me want
to burn this motherfucker down.
來吧,波奇,
讓我們不要臉的地方燒為平地!
Come on, Pookie,
let's burn this motherfucker down!
來吧,波奇!
燒了它,波奇!
Come on, Pookie!
Let's burn it, Pookie!
讓我們不要臉的地方燒為平地!
Let's burn this
motherfucker down!
燒光它!
燒了它!
Let's burn it down!
Let's burn it!
夥計,你們真應該馬上去白色城堡
So you guys maybe should just
suck it up and go to White Castle.
你總能在車裏完成工作
You can always get
your work done in the car.
- 我們去吧
- 好的,棒極了
- Let's do it.
- All right. Awesome.
聽著,聽著---不管怎樣
今晚我們沒吃到白色城堡的漢堡
Then listen, listen--no matter what,
we are not ending this night
就絕不甘休
without White Castle
in our stomachs.
- 同意嗎?
- 同意
- Agreed?
- Agreed.
明智的選擇
Wise choice.
你們差點就嘗到了
You guys might have
wanted to stay away
我們今晚的特別沙司
from our special sauce tonight.
波奇和我,
我們加了一種特別配料
Me and Pookie,
we added a secret ingredient.
給你一個提示
l'll give you a hint.
精液
lt's semen.
精液
Semen.
動物精液
Animal semen.
老兄,記得金斯坦曾經
在這個漢堡店工作過嗎?
Dude, remember when Goldstein

這是我看過最糟糕的電影了--
This is the most fucking confusing
movie l've ever seen--
該瘋狂的時候，她不瘋狂
she's possessed,
she's not possessed.
那種折磨還應該可以妖豔點兒
Dude, that rack better be stacked.

你經常和她通電話
You talk to her on the phone
all the time.
她打給我的
然後長談一些
She calls me.
Then she rambles on
關於她的東亞學生俱樂部或者什麼
about her East Asian
Students Club or whatever.
然後我不得不胡扯一通
Then l have to actually pretend
that l give a shit
否則她就叫我是Twinkie.
or else she calls me a Twinkie.
叫你什麼?
A what?
Twinkie--皮是黃的，心是白的.
Twinkie--yellow on the outside,
white on the inside.
聽著，你這個Twinkie,
Look, you Twinkie bitch,
是你把我們的好東西扔到窗外的?
you were the one that threw
our weed out the window, okay?
所以我們要去普林斯頓,
So we're going to Princeton,

服用安定劑...
What Dr. Lee is trying to say
is that we need to sedate the patient...
- ...否則心跳將要停止
- 好的,我去拿麻醉藥
- ...or he could go into cardiac arrest.
- All right, l'll get the anesthesiologist.
等一下,護士,我們要的是大麻
Hang on a second, nurse. What we
should probably use is marijuana.
那個會很好的讓病人安定
That'll sufficiently
sedate the patient for surgery.
大麻?
Marijuana?
但是為什麼?
But why?
我們沒時間問這個了
We don't have time for questions.
我們現在需要大麻,
盡可能多的!
We need marijuana now,
as much of it as possible!
像一大袋那麼多
Like a big bag of it.
但是,醫生,我們這裏沒有大麻
But, Doctor, we don't have
marijuana in this hospital.
操
Shit.
噢,操!
這傢伙快死了!
Oh, shit!
This guy's gonna die!
醫生,你要做點什麼
否則他會死的!
Doctor, you've got to do something
or we're gonna lose him!
我用老式的方法來幹
l'm gonna do this
the old-fashioned way.
打開氮氣.
給我兩個大鉗子
Start the nitrous.
Give me two large-bore l.V.s
再打開調節分泌裝置.
and start a Ringers lactate push.
Roldy醫生, 按住這裏.
Dr. Roldy, hold this.
再來點紗布
More gauze, please.
- 醫生, 病人快不能呼吸了
- 老兄, 他不能呼吸了，不能呼吸了!
- Doctor, the patient is desatting.
- Dude, he's desatting! He's desatting!
病人肺部虛脫.
我需要一個4號的血管針.
The patient has a collapsed lung.
l need a 1 4-gauge angiocath stat.
- 天才
- 謝謝你
- That was genius.
- Thank you.
- 做的好!
- 你們幹的好
- Great job!
- You guys did it.
不,是你們
No, it's you.
- 性感
- 你說什麼?
- Sexy.
- What'd you say?
沒什麼
Nothing.
甜心
Sweet-pea.
病人似乎穩定了
The patient appears
to be stabilized.
- 幹的好,所有的醫生們
- 好的,來個人把這裏清理乾淨
- Good work, doctors, all around.
- Great. One of you clean this up, please.
- 把胸管放進去
- 喵,你濕了
- Put the chest tube in.
- Meow. You're moist.
- 我不會再出汗了
- 你在聽
- l'm not sweating anymore.
- You're glistening.
柔軟的巧克力色的唇...
Soft and chocolate lips...
- 能幫我擦一下嗎?
- 安靜,安靜
- Could l get a little dab here?
- Hush now, hush now.
打擾一下,先生
你知道
Excuse me, sir.
Do you happen to know
怎麼去希爾鎮的白色城堡嗎?
how to get to the White Castle
in Cherry Hill from here?
是的,從南部的收費公路
往西走33英里
Yeah. Take the 33 west
and take the Turnpike south,
就到了
and there you are.
我跟你說,太驚奇了!
l'm telling you, man,
that was amazing!
就算你爸爸也會留下深刻的印象
Even your dad would
have been impressed, man.
是的,還沒那麼壞
Yeah, it wasn't that bad.
好極了,我們回到了公路上
我們有了方向,雨也停了
This is perfect. We're back on the road,
we got directions, it stopped raining.
夥計,猜我幹了什麼
And guess what, man.
- 我正式的完成了工作
- 噢,是嗎?不錯
- l'm officially done with my work.
- Oh, yeah? Nice!
我跟你說,老兄
事情終於走上正軌了
l'm telling you, dude,
things are finally starting to go our way.
嘿,老兄,看啊--
十六根蠟燭
Hey, dude, check it out--
Sixteern Carndles.
那不是你最喜歡看的電影嗎?
lsn't that your favorite movie?
喔,夥計,太好了!
Wow, man, that's awesome!
唷,看誰在那兒等著進場
Yo, look who decided
to go see it.
操他媽的
Holy shit.
瞧!你還說你們沒什麼共同點
See! You said you two
had nothing in common,
但你們對電影的品味卻同樣的糟糕!
but you both have the same
lame taste in movies!
閉嘴
Shut up.
嘿,我們應該問問她願不願意
一起去白色城堡
Hey, we should ask her if she
wants to come to White Castle.
不,不,不
忘了她,開車吧
No. No, no.
Forget about it. Just drive.
老兄,來吧
現在是早上1:00
Dude, come on.
lt's 1 :00 in the morning.
我們離家有一個小時路程
We're an hour away from home,
而且在路上看到了你的夢中女孩
and who do we see but your dream girl
standing across the street?
試著做個亞洲版的湯姆-漢克斯
Just pretend you're a nerdy
Asian version of Tom Hanks
她就是那個有著大胸部的拉丁女郎
and she's a hot Latina Meg Ryan
with bigger tits.
車走了
我們能走嗎?怎麼樣?
The cars are going.
Can we go? How about that?
- 你在幹什麼?
- 打擾了,瑪利亞!
- What are you doing?
- Excuse me, Maria!
- 你在幹什麼?
- 瑪利亞!打擾你一下!
- What are you doing?
- Maria! Excuse me for a second!
來這兒!
Come here!
不!你到底在幹什麼!
No! What the hell
are you doing?
拿開你的手!
操!
Get your hand off the gas!
Shit!
- 我被卡住了!
- 別拐車輪!
- l'm stuck!
- Stop turning the wheel!
- 我被卡住了!
- 你被卡住了是什麼意思?
- l am stuck!
- What do you mean you're stuck?
快鬆開!
Get unstuck!
- 你這個混蛋!
- 什--什--?
- You asshole!
- Wha--wha--?
我們差點就受重傷了,夥計!
We could have seriously
injured ourselves, man!
唷,別怪我,夥計
Yo, don't blame me, genius.
不是我一個人拿的主意,是嗎?
l'm not the one who decided
to run us off the frickin' road, all right?
我們返回公路吧,好嗎?
Let's just get
back on the highway, okay?
沒問題
Fine with me.
好笑麼？
lt's not funny.
- 我的備用輪胎在哪兒?
- 我不知道
- Where's my spare tire?
- l don't know.
我的備用輪胎到底在哪兒?
Where the hell
is my spare tire?
噢,是的!
Oh, yeah!
老兄,記得那次我們喝醉了嗎
Dude, remember that time
we got really stoned
我們把輪胎扔到橋下看能不能浮起來?
and started throwing shit off
that bridge to see if it would float?
哪個橋?我不大記--
你在說什麼?
What bridge? l don't remem--
What are you talking about?
噢,操,是那樣,和金斯坦在一起那次
Oh, shit, that's right.
That was with Goldstein.
我們借了你的車,我的錯
We borrowed your car
that night. My bad.
你的錯?那我們現在該怎麼辦?
Your bad? What the hell
are we gonna do now?
- 嗨!
- 嗨! 對不起!
- Hey!
- Hey! Excuse me!
- 你好!
- 對不起!
- Hello! Over here!
- Excuse me!
你們需要幫助嗎?
You boys need some help?
謝謝你幫我們出去
Thanks for helping us out.
沒問題
No problem at all.
我看到你們兩個在黑暗中無助的樣子,
l seen you two stranded
out there alone in the dark,
我對自己說...
and l said to myself...
''上帝該做點什麼?''
''What would Jesus do?''
Goin' down to Georgia
Gonna get myself baptized,
gonna get myself baptized
ln the bosom of the Lord
你們信奉基督嗎?
Have you boys accepted Jesus
as your Lord and Savior?
- 是的
- 是的,他很偉大,很酷
- Yes.
- Yeah, he's great. Cool guy.
感謝上帝讓我熬過戰爭!
Praise the Lord
and pass the ammunition!
我叫蘭迪,
但是每個人都叫我“Freakshow”
Name's Randy,
but everybody calls me Freakshow.
我叫卡瑪
My name's Kumar.
你好,卡尼
How are you, Kunie?
- 這是哈樂德
- 嗨,加羅德,你好嗎?
- This is Harold.
- Hi, Jerald. How are you?
我們現在是去哪兒?
So where exactly
are we going?
別擔心,我們離我的地方不遠
Don't you worry about that none.
We ain't too far from my place.
到了那兒, 我會很快幫你們修好車
Once we get there, l'll have
your ride fixed up in a jiffy.
看他頸上的那些水皰
Check out those boils
on his neck.
你必須看
有一個在有規律的搏動
You gotta look.
One of them's actually pulsating.
閉嘴,他就在我旁邊
他能聽到你
Shut up. He's right next to me.
He can hear you.
現在有幾個在臉上
Now there's some sort of puss.
- 太噁心了!
- 閉嘴
- lt's disgusting!
- Shut up.
那個小癤子
看啊
Just one little boil.
Just look at it.
看,是不是你見過最噁心的東西了
See, isn't that the most disgusting
thing you've ever seen?
你認為就因為你在耳語
Do you think just
because you're whispering,
他就聽不到你在說什麼了嗎?
he can't hear
what you're saying?
他就在兩步遠
能聽到我們講的一切
He's two feet away from us.
He can hear this entire conversation.
他能聽到我正在說的
He can hear me
talking right now.
別擔心
他什麼都聽不到...
Don't worry about it.
He can't hear anything...
用他那些耳朵裏的硬皮
not with all that crust in his ear.
我聽到了你說的一切
l heard everything you said.
修好你們的汽車要一點時間
lt's gonna take me a while
to fix up your car there,
如果你們願意,可以進屋裏坐坐
so if you boys like,
you can go on inside,
自己拿點東西喝,清洗一下
get yourselves something
to drink, wash up,
操我妻子, 看電視--
隨便你想做什麼
fuck my wife, watch TV--
anything you want.
我的房屋就是你們的房屋
Mi casa es su casa.
別做上帝不願意做的事
Just don't do anything
the Good Lord wouldn't do.
謝謝
Thank you.
我們會死的
他會殺了我們
We're gonna die.
He's going to kill us.
我們會死的
We're gonna die.
老兄,我是不是聾了,那傢伙說
讓我們幹他妻子
Dude, am l deaf, or did he just say
we get to fuck his wife?
他不可能說那些
He couldn't have said that.
誰關心?
你也見過Freakshow了
Who cares?
You've seen Freakshow.
他的老婆能好到哪兒去?
What do you think his wife
is gonna look like?
噢,嗨,孩子們
Oh, hi, boys.
我是Freakshow的妻子莉安
l'm Freakshow's wife Liane.
要不要來點檸檬汁?
Can l get you some pink lemonade?
為什麼不去臥室坐坐?
Why don't you just go
have a seat in the living room?
我一會兒就回來
l'll be back in a jiffy.
謝謝
Thanks.
- 辣,辣!
- 噢!
- Hot. Hot!

- 她不醜
- Dude, Liane is fucking hot.
- She's not ugly.
給,孩子們
Here you go, boys.

莉安,你和Freakshow的關係怎樣
Liane, how are things between you
and Freakshow presently?
噢! 不能再好了
我們非常愛對方
Oh! They've never been better.
We love each other so much.
我只想知道,
像Freakshow那樣的傢伙怎麼...
l was just wondering,
how does a guy like Freakshow...
...最終和你在一起了?
...end up with a girl like you?
嗯,我們在唱詩班認識的
大約4年前
Well, we met at choir practice
about four years ago.
Freakshow 那時非常害羞,
你們知道,
Freakshow was really shy
back then, you know,
因為那些頸上和臉上的癤子
'cause of all his hideous boils
on his face and neck.
當然,當然
Sure, sure.
但是他有著最動聽的聲音
But he had
the most amazing voice,
像一隻小金絲雀一樣
like a baby canary.
魔鬼處處有
The devil is everywhere
嘿,蘭迪, 什麼,
魔鬼,哼
Hey, Randy, what,
the devil, huh
魔鬼處處有
The devil is everywhere
嘿,蘭迪, 什麼,
Hey, Randy, what
復活節後的一天,
我告訴他我是多麼喜歡他的單曲
After Easter service one day,
l told him how much l loved his solo
他終於聚起勇氣約我出去
and he finally mustered up
the courage to ask me out.
我們從那時候開始相愛
We've been in love ever since.
那麼,你們現在想幹我還是?
So, are you boys gonna
fuck me now or what?
石頭, 剪刀,布
看誰先上,準備好了嗎?
Rock, paper, scissors
to see who goes first. Ready?
- 石頭,剪刀---
- 等片刻
- Rock, paper--
- Wait a second.
Freakshow怎麼辦?
What about Freakshow?
什麼? 我們難道不知道
該怎麼過的快樂嗎?
What? You assume we don't
know how to have a good time?
我只是...
l just...
沒關係
石頭,剪刀,布
Never mind.
Rock, paper, scissors.
對不起,如果你們想要我
你們必須得一起上
Sorry, but if you boys want me,
you have to do me at the same time.
- 嗯?
- 來吧,給我雙分填充料
- Huh?
- Come on, give me the double stuff.
我們不是很清楚,莉安
l'm not sure
we quite understand, Liane.
我要你們同時進入我
l want you both
inside me simultaneously.
- 一個洞還是兩個?
- 隨你們便
- One hole or two?
- Whatever you want.
抱歉,不,謝謝
不用,謝謝
Sorry. No, thank you.
No, thank you.
老兄,如果是兩個洞
還不是那麼糟糕
Dude, if it's two holes,
it might not be that bad.
- 幹肛門
- 別提了!
- Shotgun anus.
- Forget it!
我不想要我們的
蛋蛋互相撞來撞曲
l don't want our balls
rubbing against each other.
- 什麼,你在開玩笑嗎?
- 絕不!忘了吧
- What, are you kidding?
- No way! Forget it.
口交怎麼樣?
能口交嗎?
How about blow jobs?
Can we have blow jobs?
好的
Well, okay.

Come here.
好的,我來了
Okay. l'm going up there.

Okay, yeah.
lt's a little sticky there.
- 你能做到
- 是的

- Yeah, let's do that.
- Okay.
我們一起
Let's do that.
喂，你們的車胎修好了
Well, boys, l fixed your tire.
嗨, 親愛的
Hi, honey.
你們跟我老婆幹嘛呢
What in the hell
are you doing with my wife?
你說你在外頭時我們就能
跟你幹你妻子
You said outside that
we could have sex with her.
操!操!
Shit! Shit!
-但我沒說過
- 不,你說了
- l most certainly did not.
- Yeah, you did.
- 沒有!
- 說了.
- l did not!

- You sure?
- You said it.
那錯怪你們了!
My mistake!
Freakshow.
Freakshow.
好吧，既然我們都在......
Well, since we're all here...
...四個人一起來，怎麼樣?
...how about a foursome?
誰想第一個上?
Who wants the first reach-around?
好吧，說好了，
剛才的事誰也不准再提
Okay, let's agree to never talk
about what just happened.
同意
Agreed.
想法不錯
That's a very good idea.
我說哥們，我們在哪兒
Dude, l have no idea
where we are.
什麼?
What?
- 那是個要搭車的嗎?
- 你想幹啥?
- ls that a hitchhiker?
- What the hell?
- 我們是不是讓他上來?
- 然後把他砍成碎片? 你瘋了吧?
- Should we pick him up?
- And get chopped to bits? Are you crazy?
你知道什麼? 咱們迷路了. 他可能知道
怎麼回到高速公路上.
You know what? We're lost. He may
know how to get back on the highway.
接著開.
這可是我的車.
Get back on the road.
This is my car.
別讓人搭車。
We are not picking up
a hitchhiker, man.
嘿，哥門兒們，多謝讓我搭車
Hey, guys, thanks
for picking me up.
不好意思,
你是Neil Patrick Harris嗎?
Excuse me,
are you Neil Patrick Harris?
對啊.
Yep.
- 哦，天哪，你在這幹嘛?
- 太棒了.
- Oh, my God, what are you doing here?
- Holy shit.
Doogie Howser M.D.是我
小時侯最喜歡的節目了
Dude, Doogie Howser M.D. was,
like, my favorite show growing up.
你就是我的偶像.
You were my idol.
那太好了，我們可以走了麼？
這地方噁心死我了
That's great. Could we get going?
l'm bored as shit back here.
- 走，走.
- 出發！這地方簡直糟透了
- Go, go.
- Let's go. This is a frickin' boring spot.
問你個問題, Neil,
So l gotta ask you, Neil,
你私底下“搞”過Wanda沒?
did you ever get it on
with Wanda off the set?
我上過參與那個節目的所有的人
Dude, l humped every piece
of ass ever on that show.
連那個扮演護士的都......?
Even the chick
who played the hot nurse?
沒. 我跟她不是一路.
No. l didn't go
all the way with her.
Neil, 你知不知道
Neil, you wouldn't happen to know
從這兒怎麼上到高速公路上去?
how to get on the highway
from here, would you?
我連現在自己在哪兒都不知道
Dude, l don't even know
where the fuck l am right now.
今晚早些時候我參加了個聚會
l was at this party earlier tonight
有個人用個難以置信的東西把
我迷倒了.
and some guy hooked me up
with this incredible X.
接下來，我就只知道自己被人從
車上扔下來了.
The next thing l know, l'm being
thrown out of a moving car.
- 我一直在到處遊蕩
- 那太瘋狂了, 哥們.
- l've been tripping balls ever since.
- That's crazy, dude.
我們今天晚上也很瘋狂
We've been having
a pretty crazy night, too.
我們一直在開著車找白色城堡,
We've just been driving around
looking for White Castle,
但是總是找不到目標
but we keep getting sidetracked.
是啊,老兄,你讓我著迷
Yeah, dude, you fascinate me.
忘了白色城堡
讓我們去找一些姑娘
Forget White Castle.
Let's go get some pussy.
- 嗯?
- 這裏有一根饑餓的香腸呢
- Huh?
- lt's a fuckin' sausage-fest in here.
我們找點樂子
再去白色城堡
Let's get us some poontang.
Then we'll go to White Castle.
不, Neil, 你不懂.
No, Neil, you don't understand.
我們渴望了一晚上的漢堡
We've been craving
these burgers all night.
是啊,我也渴望漢堡---陰毛漢堡
Yeah, l've been craving
burgers, too--fur burgers.
來吧,哥們,去脫衣舞俱樂部找點樂子
Come on, dudes, let's pick up
some trim at a strip club.
The Doogie line
那兒有許多脫衣舞者
The Doogie line
always works on strippers.
裸體跳舞
Lap dance.
那有個加油站，去看看
能不能問到路.
There's a gas station.
l'm gonna see if we can get directions.
我們不用...
We don't need...
快啊, 哥們, 快點.
我是失敗的木頭
Hurry up, dudes, hurry up.
l'm losing wood.
快，快，快
快，快，快
Hurry, hurry, hurry,
hurry, hurry, hurry.
- 安靜
- 我們會回來的, Neil.
- Chill.
- We'll be right back, Neil.
我們會回來的.
We'll be back.
Neil Patrick Harris怎麼了?
為什麼這麼著急?
What's the deal with Neil Patrick Harris?
Why is he so horny?
我不知道，但是我們不能讓他
耽誤我們的事.
l don't know, but we can't
let him interfere with our quest.
- 哦，暈
- 靠，又是這群龐克男.
- Oh, God.
- Shit, these punks again.
又見面了,同志們?
Late-night Math League
meeting, homos?

No, no.
Pies, pies--no.
那是什麼玩意？是翼龍嗎？
Dude, what is that?
ls that a pterodactyl?
我不知道.
l do not know what that is.
太刺激了,老兄!
That was extreme, dude!
打擾了，問一下從這裏怎麼走才能上
高速公路?
Excuse me, can you tell us how
to get to the highway from here?
哥們，看這個.
Dude, l got this.
老兄,誰知道學了印度語會派上用場?
Dude, who knew learning Hindi
would actually pay off?
那傢伙說公路就離這幾個路燈遠
Guy says the highway is, like,
a couple traffic lights from here.
我們十分鐘就能到希爾鎮
We should be in Cherry Hill

從1到10評分,
On a scale of 1 to 10,
1 是無極限
10是極限中極限,
one being not so extreme
and ten being extremely extreme,
我給這個評分9.5!

Somebody should do something.
是的, 說的對
Yeah, you're right.
嘿, 混蛋們!
為什麼不能放這個人一馬？
Hey, asshole!
Why don't you leave that guy alone
別再做那些古怪的行為舉止?
and go jerk off to some
snowboarding videos or something?
我沒說是要你這樣
l didn't mean you
should do something about it.
什麼? 你要管?
What? You're gonna take that?
那該怎麼辦?嗯?
What's up with that? Huh?
你要管嗎?
You're gonna take that?
- 耶!
- 耶!
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
- 幹!
- 這就對了，白癡!
- Shit!
- That's right, bitch!
你試著再幹我一次!
You just try fuckin' with me

歡迎下次光臨
Just try it!
Thank you, come again.

卡瑪, 你沒事吧?
Kumar, you okay?
沒事,
我就是討厭那幫混蛋.
Yeah, dude,
l just hate those assholes.
要我說，去他的，我餓了.
咱們趕緊走吧
You know what? Fuck it, l'm hungry.
Let's just get outta here.
你看到誰偷了我的車嗎?
Did Doogie Howser
just steal my fucking car?
是，好象是的
Yes. l think he did.
你!都是你非要讓他搭車。
咋辦!?
You! You had to pick up
a hitchhiker! Why?!
冷靜一下
Calm down.
你為什麼把車鑰匙留在車裏?
Why did you leave
the keys in the car?
為什麼?
就是為了讓它被偷唄
Why? Because
it would get stolen.
我原以為Neil Patrick Harris這
人可以相信呢
l figured that Neil Patrick Harris
was a trustworthy guy.
拜託，我怎麼知道他會做
這種事?
Come on. How was l supposed
to know he'd fuck us over?
整個晚上全是怪事,
今天整個晚上,全是你的錯!
This whole freaking night,
this whole night, is your fault!
- 你去哪?
- 去店裏打電話報警.
- Where are you going?
- l'm going inside to call the police.
我不想再跟你說話了
l don't want
to talk to you anymore.
- 耶!
- 耶!
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
街對面有個電話亭，你可以去那打
There's a pay phone
across the street
如果你不想再碰那撥混蛋
if you don't wanna
deal with those assholes.
我們報警之後，就去白色城堡，對吧?
After we talk to the cops, we're
still going to White Castle, right?
我不跟你講話
l'm not speaking to you.
什麼時候他們能發明出那種
When are they fucking going
to develop button technology
能夠明白緊急情況的按鈕技術?!
that will understand urgency?!
- 老兄,太可笑了,走過去吧
- 馬上就會變的
- Dude, this is ridiculous. Just walk across.
- lt'll change in a second.
四周看不見車.
過去吧
There's not a car in sight.
Just go ahead.
好啊. 你要讓我過去?
好啊，我過.
Fine. You want me to cross?
l will cross.
如果能讓你高興，我這就過.
lf it makes you happy,
l will cross.
我要過了.
l'll do it.
幹!
Shit!
- 什麼事--
- 對不起.
- What--
- Sorry.
有什麼事情嗎,
Palumbo警官?
ls there a problem,
Officer Palumbo?
有什麼事情?
你聽說過走路不遵守交通規則嗎?
ls there a problem?
You ever heard of jaywalking?
是的,我真的抱歉
不會再發生了
Yes, l have. l'm really sorry.
Won't happen again.
那就好了.
我給你開張罰單
That's great.
l'm writing you up a ticket.
罰單?
你說真的?
A ticket?
Are you serious?
你是哪個, 狗屎?
Who the fuck are you, shitwad?
讓我替我的朋友道歉
我非常抱歉
Let me apologize
for my friend here. l'm very sorry.
很高興你在這裏
我們有一個糟糕的晚上

Neil Patrick Harris
今晚偷了我的車
Neil Patrick Harris
stole my car tonight.
嘿, NPH不會那樣做的,是嗎?
Hey, NPH wouldn't do that,
all right?
給我你們的身份證明
Give me some l.D.
不好意思,你怎麼能對走路沒遵守交通
規則的人開罰單?
Excuse me, how can you
give him a ticket for jaywalking?
現在是早上2:30
這附近沒有車
lt's 2:30 in the morning.
There's not a car around here.
卡瑪,閉嘴
Kumar, shut up.
你不應該用這種語調
That's not the kind of tone
you want to use
對一個能操翻你屁股的警官說話
on a cop who can bust your ass.
- 操翻我屁股?
- 是啊,卡--瑪
- Bust my ass?
- Yeah, Koo-mar.
操翻你屁股
Bust your ass.
什麼垃圾名字?卡--瑪
What kind of name
is that anyhow? Koo-mar.
什麼東西,是有5個o還是2個u?
What is that,
like, five O's or two U's?
不,實際上只有一個u
No, it's actually one U.
胡說
Yeah, bullshit.
為什麼不取些好的美國名字
像"DAVE"或者"JIM"
Whatever happened to good old
American names like Dave or Jim?
- 哈樂德
- 哈樂德
- Harold.
- Harold.
- 你在開玩笑--
- 這個名字不錯
- Are you kidd--
- Now that's a great name.
- 這件事讓我自己來
- 你會因這個名字而驕傲的,孩子
- Let me take care of this.
- You should be proud of that name, son.
像你們這樣,小姐們
As you were, ladies.
- $220?! 你瘋了嗎?!
- 卡瑪,如果你不停下--
- $220?! Are you crazy?!
- Kumar, if you don't stop--
不,我知道現在在發生些什麼
No, l understand exactly
what's going on here.
對不起,長官,讓我猜想一下
Excuse me, officer, let me
take a couple of guesses.
- 真的抱歉--
- 把你的手放下!
- l'm really sorry--
- Get your hands down!
- 好的,不錯
- 別亂動,放在身後!
- Okay, alright.
- No sudden moves. Back it up!
你在中學時肯定是個大混球, 是嗎?
You were probably the big asshole
in your high school, right?
完全正確
Absolutely right.
只會抓些像我們這樣的傢伙,對嗎?
Used to pick on guys like us
every day, right?
非常樂意
With pleasure.
然後畢業的日子到了,
我們上了大學
Then graduation day came,
and we went to college,
你無處可去,
然後你想
and you went nowhere,
and you thought,
嘿,我怎樣還能捉弄他們?
''Hey, how can l
still give them shit?
我知道了,我應該成為一名警官
l know, l'll become a cop.''
好的,祝賀你
你美夢成真
Well, congratu-fuckin'-lations.
Your dream has come true.
為什麼你只抓這個安靜矮小
Now, why don't you just take
this quiet little Asian guy
有英國化名字的,對你這麼好的亞洲人
with the Anglicized name
that treats you so well
還給他這麼重的罰單?
and give him a couple
of other tickets?
- 把他帶到監獄不是更好嗎
- 更好的主意
- Better yet, just take him to jail.
- Better idea.
為什麼不逮捕他?
那對你有用嗎,哈樂德?
Why don't you just arrest him?
Does that work out for you okay, Harold?
- ''偉大的美國名字,哈樂德''
- 我們走吧,哈樂德
- ''Great American name, Harold.''
- Let's go, Harold.
由於你的夥伴,
我們要走一趟--
Thanks to your buddy,
we're going downtow--
噢,操
Oh, shit.
好的,非常感謝你能理解Bradley.
Well, thank you so much for

- For being black.
認真點
Seriously.
我是認真的
你想知道發生什麼嗎?
l am serious.
You wanna know what happened?
我在Barnes & Noble外面散步
l was walking
out of a Barnes & Noble,
然後一位警官讓我停下
and a cop stops me.
明顯的一個黑人搶劫了Newark的銀行
Evidently a black guy
robbed a store in Newark.
我告訴他, ''我幾個月沒去Newark了''
l told him, ''l haven't even been
to Newark in months.''
然後,他用警棍不停的打我...
So, he starts beating me
with his gun...
- ...告訴我停止反抗
- 操他媽的! 你怎麼做?
- ...telling me to stop resisting arrest.
- Holy shit! What'd you do?
我不停的說,
''我知道我被捕了
l kept saying,
''l understand l'm under arrest.
現在別打我了''
Now please stop beating me.''
我不明白為什麼你對這一切如此冷靜
l don't understand how
you can be so calm about all this.
看我
我肥,黑,不會跳舞
Look at me.
l'm fat, black, can't dance,
還有兩個同性戀父親
and l have two gay fathers.
人們把我的一生都搞的混亂
People have been
messing with me my whole life.
很久之前我學會了不要對每件事動怒
l learned a long time ago that
there's no sense getting all riled up
不要在意每次一群傻瓜對你的為難
every time a bunch of idiots
give you a hard time.
最後,事情總會好起來的
ln the end, the universe tends
to unfold as it should.
加上我有一個真正的大屌
那讓我很高興
Plus l have a really large penis.
That keeps me happy.
嘿,嘿,聽著,夥計
Hey, hey, listen up, guys!

我會救你出去,然後我們去吃漢堡
l figured l'd bust you out

我因為你才來這裏的
l'm already in here because of you.
嘿,操你!
Hey, fuck you!
你要我做些什麼,
站在那兒接受教訓?
What did you want me to do,
stand there and take the hit?
你知道我從沒有求過你
You know l've never
taken a swing at you, ever.
我從沒把你的車弄丟
Well, l never got your car stolen.
- 好的,我走了
- 好的
- Fine. l'm leaving.
- Fine.
- 哈樂德,我怎麼從這兒出去?
- 我怎麼會知道?
- Harold, how do l get out of here?

操! 噢,天啊,情況不妙
Shit! Oh, God, this isn't good.
我的屁股!
My ass!
真的不想離開這嗎?
Sure you don't want

成為一個逃亡者?
你是白癡嗎?
And become a fugitive?
Are you nuts?
- 那傢伙有我所有的資料
- 那又怎樣?
- The guy has all my information.
- So what?
我們把那些資料帶走就行了
We'll just take what he

我們要教你怎麼讀書,兄弟

- Thanks, man.
上帝
謝謝你把我救出來
Jesus Christ.
Thanks for getting me out, man.
沒問題,沒你在的話漢堡也吃的不香
No problem. The burgers wouldn't
taste as good if you weren't there.
嘿,看這個
Hey, look at this.
好像我們從一窮二白突然變成百萬富翁
lt's like we went from being
completely poor to being millionaires.
- 那是什麼?
- 或許只是山狗
- What was that?
- Probably just a coyote.
人們不是應該害怕山狗嗎?
Aren't people supposed to
be scared of coyotes?
那只是因為他們叫起來很可怕,兄弟
That's just
'cause they sound scary, man.
一對一的戰鬥,我們兩個中任何一個
都能對付一個山狗
ln one-on-one combat, either of us
could take down a coyote, no problem.
什麼?
What?
印度豹就不一樣了
Now, cheetahs are another story.
- 我們會死的
- 不會,冷靜點
- We're gonna die.
- No, now hold on.
印度豹習慣吃羚羊和狗屎
Cheetahs are used to
eating gazelles and shit.
他們不知道吃人
They're not known
for eating humans.
那是一個屍體
我們要死了
That is a corpse.
We're gonna die.
操!
不是一個好跡象
Shit!
That's not a good sign.
也許我們安靜的呆著,安靜的呆著
它就會走開的
Maybe if we just stay really,
really still, he'll just go away.
好的
Okay.
真正的呆著
別動,好嗎?
Just stay really still.
Don't move, okay?
就呆在那兒
非常好,幹的不錯
Just stay right there.
Very good. Good job.
沒有用
This isn't working.
它在咬我!
它在咬我!
He's mauling me!
He's mauling me!
老兄,我告訴過你別拿牛肉幹
Dude, l told you not
to bring the beef jerky.
它喜歡我
He likes me.
嘿,羅德,我有個主意
Hey, Rold, l have an idea.
- 你一定是在耍我,老兄
- 啊哈
- You gotta be kidding me, man.
- Uh-uh.
這真是一個明智的舉動
This is either a really smart move
或者是我們目前為止做的最蠢的事情
or by far the stupidest thing
that we have ever tried.
好的,我們將要發現
Well, we're about to find out.
走!
Mush!
我告訴過你這是--
l told you this was--
噢!
Oy vey!
老兄,真的很爽
竟然成功了!
Dude, am l really high,

我們馬上就會到白色城堡!
We're gonna be

你昏了半個小時了
You've been out cold

我估計做一些同志舉動
會讓你醒過來
l figured maybe if l did
some gay shit you'd wake up.
為什麼做那個?
我們在哪兒?
lf we did some gay shit?
Where are we?
我們是坐印度豹來到這裏的嗎?
印度豹去哪兒了?
Didn't we come here on a cheetah?
Where's the cheetah?
它跑了,聽著,忘了那頭豹子,好嗎?
lt ran away. Listen, forget
about the cheetah, okay?
我有一些壞消息,和更壞的消息
l have some bad news
and some worse news.
先告訴我更壞的消息
Give me the worse news first.
我在那邊看到一些路標
l looked at some
of the road signs up there,
看起來好像印度豹把我們帶到了
相反的方向
and it looks like the cheetah
took us in the wrong direction.
- 操!
- 是的
- Shit!
- Yeah.
- 操!
- 是的
- Shit!
- Yeah.
好吧, 那壞消息是什麼?
All right, what's the bad news?
你的筆記本電腦完全摔碎了
Your laptop's completely destroyed.
什麼?
What?
為什麼不--
為什麼你不告訴我--
Why didn't--
Why didn't you tell me--
為什麼這個不是更壞的消息?
How is that not
the worse news?
電腦的事情只影響了你
The laptop situation
really only affects you,
白色城堡的事的確影響了我們兩個人
whereas the White Castle
situation affects both of us equally.
噢,不!噢,不!
Oh, no! Oh, no!
我所有的工作都保存在電腦裏!
All my work was saved

現在我必須返回辦公室重新做了

別提了!我不會為了幾個漢堡而
冒生命危險,夥計
Forget it! l'm not risking my life

所以你認為這只是為了漢堡嗎,嗯?
So you think this is
just about the burgers, huh?
讓我告訴你,
遠比漢堡要多
Let me tell you,
it's about far more than that.
我們的父母來到這個國家,
Our parents came to this country,
逃離迫害,
貧窮,和饑餓
escaping persecution,
poverty, and hunger.
饑餓,哈樂德
Hunger, Harold.
他們非常非常的餓
They were very, very hungry.
他們想居住在一塊平等對待他們
的土地上
They wanted to live in a land
that treated them as equals,
一塊站滿了漢堡的土地
a land filled with hamburger stands.
不只是一種漢堡,對嗎?
And not just
one type of hamburger, okay?
幾百種不同種類,大小,味道的漢堡
Hundreds of types with different
sizes, toppings, and condiments.
那塊熱土就是美國
That land was America.
美國,哈樂德!美國!
America, Harold! America!
現在,我們是要完成父母交給我們的任務
Now, this is about achieving
what our parents set out for.
這關係著我們的幸福
This is about the pursuit
of happiness.
這個晚上...
是關於那個美國夢的
This night...
is about the American dream.
老兄,我們可以呆在這裏
等待被捕
Dude, we can stay here,
get arrested,
永遠結束我們去白色城堡的夢想
and end our hopes of ever
going to White Castle.
或者我們乘著那架滑翔機
朝自由飛去
Or we can take that hang glider
and make our leap towards freedom.
我把選擇權交給你
l leave the decision up to you.
我恨你,卡瑪
l hate you, Kumar.
傾斜好方向
Tilt forward.
- 羅德
- 什麼?
- Roldy.
- What?
- 別擔心,所有事情都會好起來的
- 好的
- Don't worry. Everything's gonna be fine.
- All right.
- 幹得好,羅德,繼續跑
- 謝謝
- Good job, Rold. Keep running.
- Thank you.
嘿,羅德,有些事情要告訴你
Hey, Roldy, there's something
l forgot to tell you.
- 我以前從沒玩過滑翔機
- 什麼?!
- l've never hang-glided before.
- What?!
跳!
Jump!
噢,我的天!
Oh, my God!
- 老兄,成功了!
- 噢,我的天!
- Dude, it's working!
- Oh, my God!
耶!
Yeah!
好消息
Good news.
我在車裏找到了足夠的大麻
l just found enough dope in the car
讓這些滑冰朋克男蹲幾年監獄了
to put these skateboard punks
in jail for the next couple of years.
- 老兄,我們現在太爽了
- 是啊
- Dude, we're so high right now.
- We're not low.
好的,我們到白色城堡那去吧
右,左,左
All right, l'm bringing her in.
Right, left, left.
完美!
Perfect!
- 操!
- 操!
- Shit!
- Shit!
上帝
God!
我要殺了你!
l'm gonna kill you!
看!
Look!
我們成功了,老兄
We made it, dude.
看起來你們忙了一夜了,嗯?
Looks like you guys
had some night, huh?
我要30份漢堡,5份炸薯條,
還有4杯大可樂
l want 30 Slyders, 5 French fries,
and 4 large Cherry Cokes.
我要一樣的,給我健怡可樂
l want the same, except
make mine Diet Cokes, Chuck.
喔,一共是 $46.75
Wow. Well, that comes
to $46.75.
- 老兄,我的錢去哪兒了?
- 你沒帶錢?
- Dude, where's my money?
- You don't have money?
- 哥們,你在開玩笑嗎?
- 不
- Dude, are you kidding me?
- No.
我的錢給了普林斯頓的那個混蛋
l gave mine
to that asshole at Princeton.
操!操死那個嬉皮士
不!不能這樣
Fuck! Fuck that hippie fuck!
No! Dude, this isn't happening!
現在我們一分錢都沒有了
We didn't make it here,
and now we're broke!
不,不,不,不!
No, no, no, no!
夥計,讓我幫你們付帳吧
這是我僅能做的了
Guys, let me pay for it.
lt's the least l can do.
你他媽的在這裏做什麼?
The hell are you doing here?
你們昨晚談論白色城堡那麼爽,
You guys kept talking about
White Castle last night so much,
也讓我對它燃起了渴望
it made me start to crave it, too.
- 老兄,我的車在哪兒?
- 他的車在哪兒,老兄?
- Dude, where's my car?
- Where's his car, dude?
是的,我很抱歉
昨晚我告訴過你們我要去舞會
Yeah, sorry about that.
l told you last night l was tripping balls.
不知道是什麼抓住了我
l don't know what came over me.
你的車在停車場
給你鑰匙
Your car's in the parking lot.
Here are your keys.
你意識到在你開走車之後
我們經歷了些多少苦難嗎
Do you realize what the hell we had to
go through after you took the car?
是的,我做了個愚蠢的舉動
Yeah. lt was a dick move
on my part.
那就是我為什麼要幫你們付帳,屌人
That's why l'm paying
for your meal. Prick.
謝謝,或許
Thanks, l guess.
這是漢堡的50美元,
還有200美元賠你們的車
Here's 50 bucks for the burgers
and 200 for the car.
我的車怎麼了?
What happened to my car?
我在後座上留下了一些愛的瑕疵
l made some love stains
in the back seat.
你會看到的
You'll see.
不管怎樣,很高興碰到你們
一會見
Anyway, nice meeting you guys.
l'll catch you later.
你去哪兒?
Where are you going?
天知道
Wherever God takes me.
喔,喔,喔
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.
讓我們一起來
Let's do this together.
媽的,真是恰到好處
Damn, that hit the spot.
- 這是我一生中吃過最好的食物了
- 我也是
- That was the best meal of my life.
- Mine, too.
老兄,你知道嗎
You know what, dude?
我想我應該會去今天的面試
l think l may actually go
to my interview today.
你在認真的說嗎?
Are you serious?
你知道我一生中最害怕的就是
You know, my whole life
l've just been scared
成為那些卑微的
印度人醫生中的一員
of being one of those nerdy
lndian guys turned doctor,
但是今晚讓我想通了
but tonight got me thinking.
這個世界上還有更糟的事情
There are far worse things
in this world than being tapped
比上醫學院更糟糕
for having a natural
ability in medicine.
Chick magret. chick magret
加上,那又是絕妙的
昨晚挽救了那個傢伙的生命?
Plus, how cool was that,
saving that dude's life last night?
通過那些事情
被我老爸教訓
lt was somewhere between that,
getting yelled at by my dad,
遇到Neil Patrick Harris
and seeing Neil Patrick Harris
我意識到,
我確實想成為一個醫生
that l realized that l've
always wanted to be a doctor
我只是害怕接納我自己
but l've just been too scared
to admit it to myself.
- 比利,你付帳?
- 是的,我來--
- Billy, you paying for this?
- Yeah, l'll be there--
好的, 因為如果他不付
就由你來
Good, 'cause if he wasn't,
you would.
你在聽我說嗎,羅德?
我在談重要的事情
Are you listening to me, Roldy?
l'm having a major epiphany here.
我一會回來
l'll be right back.
你跟我見過的其他女人都不一樣
You're unlike any other woman
l've ever met.
這裏在進行些什麼?
What the fuck is going on here?
哈樂德?
你怎麼了,夥計?
Harold?
What happened to you, man?
別在意我,
你他媽的在這裏做什麼?
Never mind me.
What the fuck are you doing here?
我以為你和J.D.
與客戶們忙了一整晚
l thought you and J.D.
were busy all night with clients.
那不是我要幫你工作的原因嗎?
lsn't that why
l had to do your work?
- 亨利,你在幹些什麼?
- 退後,屌人
- Henry, what the hell's going on?
- Back off, cock boy.
我對他說的也是對你說的
What l said to him
goes double for you.
- 你叫我屌人?
- 是的,你聽到了
- Did you just call me cock boy?
- Yeah, you know l did.
你們只是畜生
You're just stalling
因為你們的反應太慢了
because you're not quick
enough to think of a comeback.
你覺得我不夠快
那傢伙說我不夠快
You think l'm not quick enough.
Guy thinks l'm not quick enough.
好的,我告訴你最新的消息
我會很快...
Well, l've got news for you.
l am quick enough...
...屌人!
...cock boy!
聽著,哈樂德,我真的抱歉
Listen, Harold, l'm really sorry.
別煩他了
我們明天和貝爾森談談
Don't bother with him. We'll take it up
with Berenson tomorrow.
你要告訴貝爾森什麼?
What are you
gonna tell Berenson?
告訴他我是你們的馱馬嗎?
That l'm your workhorse?
你們就可以玩一個週末
That you guys think
you can party all weekend,
把工作留給這個安靜的亞洲人?
leave the work to
the quiet Asian guy in the office?
- 不,你不明白
- 不,你不明白
- No, you don't understand.
- No, you don't understand.
我不會再做你的工作了
l'm not doing
your work for you anymore.
如果你們哪一個要
And if either one
of you douche bags
或者試著再提起這件事
ever tries to pull
this shit again,
我會自己去跟貝爾森說
l'll go to Berenson myself.
我將告訴他到底發生了些什麼
l'll tell him what's really going on.
我還會告訴他
And l'll tell the whole office
你們是怎麼從Atlantic City的
妓女那裏得到淋病的
how you both caught gonorrhea
from that prostitute in Atlantic City.
如果沒什麼事
我必須得走了,卡瑪
lf you'll excuse me, boys,
l gotta get going. Kumar.
星期一辦公室見
See you boys
at the office on Monday.
不好意思
Excuse me.
老兄,你太牛B了!
你他媽的哪兒來的勇氣?
Dude, that was awesome!
Where the hell did that come from?
我不知道
l don't know.
吃了那些美味的漢堡
讓我感覺像變成了另外一個人
Eating those delicious burgers
made me feel like a new man.
你知道嗎?
You know what?
現在我真盼望著馬上開始工作
Now l'm actually looking forward
to going to work this week.
操,你知道這一切都是值得的
No shit. You know,
you might be worthwhile after all.
我有自己的價值
l'm not worthless.
嘿,那些傢伙真的得了淋病嗎?
Hey, so those dudes
really have gonorrhea?
我也不知道
Beats me.
嘿
Hey.
- 我們回家吧
- 幹嘛這麼趕,老兄
- Let's get going.
- What's the rush, dude?
我還有幾個小時才面試呢
l don't have my interview
for a couple of hours.
我有些沒完成的工作
l got some unfinished business
to take care of.
我想那些傢伙會搞定那些工作的
l thought those guys
were gonna do the work.
不,沒完成的事情
No, unfinished business.
- 瑪利亞
- 還是跟不上你
- Maria.
- Still not following you.
進來!
Get in!
你甚至沒做個計畫?
So you don't even have a plan.
老兄,我擁有愛就行了
Dude, l got love
on my side, man.
相信我
Trust me.
當我看到瑪利亞, 我會知道
該怎麼說
When l see Maria, l'm gonna
know exactly what to say.
- 嗨
- 嗨
- Hey.
- Hey.
看起來你們像是忙了一夜
lt looks like you guys
have had some night.
操,鬼知道
我怎麼把打火機落在車上了
Shit. You know what?
l left my lighter in your car.
去下面等我一下,我們去拿回來
Do me a favor and run down
and get it for me, please?
我先小便
l gotta urinate.
你確實有很多行李
You sure got a lot of baggage.
瑪利亞,等等
Maria, wait.
我知道這看起來確實很突然,
l know this is gonna seem
completely out of the blue,
我知道你也不是很瞭解我--
或者,根本不瞭解
and l know you don't know me
very well--or, um, at all.
但是讓我告訴你我一天中
最美的時光是哪個部分
But let me tell you
the best part of my day is.
我工作回家
然後走進這個電梯
l come home from work
and l walk through this lobby,
幸運的話
and on days that l'm lucky enough,
我會在這個電梯與你一起呆幾秒鐘
l spend ten seconds
in this elevator with you.
今晚我有一個瘋狂的夜晚
l had the craziest night
of my life tonight,
或許我學到了一點,
如果你想得到一樣東西
and l guess l learned that
if you want something or someone,
你必須去爭取
you have to go for it.
如果莉安也能嫁給Freakshow
And if Liane can
marry a guy like Freakshow
如果我也能飛翔
也能騎上印度豹
and l can hang-glide
and l can ride a cheetah,
那麼我想...
then l guess...
喔,操
Oh, fuck it.
Girl, l'm spendin' my dimes
等下,這太瘋狂了
Give me a minute.
This is crazy.
- 那個...對不起
- 我甚至不瞭解你
- That was...l'm sorry.
- l don't even know you.
我吃了白色城堡的漢堡,
所以有一點眩暈
l had White Castle,
so l'm a little dizzy.
- 我們從沒談過
- 我們沒談過,所以這不合適
- We don't ever speak.
- We don't talk, so that was inappropriate.
噢,操
Oh, fuck it.
我要在你身邊
h warra get rext to you
我要在你身邊
h warra get rext to you
好的
Okay.
現在你可以去做你的事情了
Now you just have to work
on your timing.
- 你要去哪兒?
- Amsterdam
- Where are you going?
- Amsterdam.
10天后回來
回來後會去拜訪你
l'll be back in ten days.
But l'll see you when l get back?
好吧,就這樣
Yeah, let's do that.
拜,哈樂德
Bye, Harold.
拜,拜
再見
Bye. Bye.
l'll see you later.
- 她跟你做了嗎?
- 什麼?
- She touch your penis?
- What?
發生什麼了?
What happened?
沒什麼,真的
只是一些親吻的舉動
Nothing much, really.
Just a little kiss action.
棒極了,棒極了!
Nice. Nice!
是的,她要去Amsterdam
10天后回來
Yeah. She's going to Amsterdam.
She'll be back in ten days.
我們得去
We gotta go.
- 哪兒?
- Amsterdam, 夥計
- Where?
- Amsterdam, man.
- 我們得去整理我們的行李...
- Amsterdam?
- We gotta get our bags packed...
- Amsterdam?
...就乘下一班飛機
...and frickin' take the next flight out.
你的不會真的這樣想把?
面試怎麼辦?
Are you freaking out of your mind?
What about your interview?
老兄,不管怎樣
我會告訴老爸重新安排一次
Dude, whatever.
l'll tell my dad to reschedule it.
只要我認真對待
他那邊就不成問題
He won't have a problem as long as
l take it seriously for a change.
我們必須得去歐洲找到瑪利亞
We gotta freakin' go to Europe
and find Maria.
老兄,她10天后就回來
Dude, she's coming back
in ten days.
我們會再見到的
lt's not like l'm never
gonna see her again.
聽著,對一個熱辣的少女來說
Listen, for a hot chick,
在歐洲的10天會被吻到死的,對嗎?
ten days in Europe
can be the kiss of death, okay?
會有許多詭異的男人圍繞在她身邊
She's gonna have all these suave,
sophisticated guys all over her.
當她回來時,已經過期了
When she gets back,
she may not be available.
別說了,我會在她回來後見到她
Forget it. l'll see her
when she comes back.
嘿,羅德
Hey, Roldy.
你還沒意識到在Amsterdam什麼是合法的,
不是嗎?
You do realize what's legal
in Amsterdam, don't you?
噢,是的
Oh, yeah.
